        "text": "Sociology \n18 October 2021\n\n\nMoving towards Gender Equality in Surfing\nGrowing up in a beach town you tend to be drawn towards the ocean and surfing. That's just what happens and what makes sense. Personally, I have a dad who is a big character in the surf community near me. So for me of course I was going to surf but I was also going to fit into the surf community with no effort. I did not have to prove anything. For me, it was a birthright. However, it doesn't work out like that for all people who end up surfing especially if you are a female. Back in the day, females had to fight for respect in the water.  This gender difference was apparent. However, today, surfing is making moves to include the female population. Even though there is movement in the right direction for gender equality, there are still differences that exist.\nSurfing throughout the years has always been more of a masculine sport and the guys have always been the people to do it. Back when my dad was starting to surf in the late 80s there were very few females in the water. There would be about ten males per every one female out in the water. Even when females would paddle out they would never get the best waves. They were seen by other surfers as a joke and did not get any respect for the sport. This was not only obvious to the surfers but was also evident when surf videos were released. Lost, a board company, put out many videos such as Lost Across America. These videos did not show females surfing. Girls were shown in bikinis on the beach. There wasn\u2019t a market for women surfers. Even in the professional surfing world, women professional surfers were not recognized. There was not a large crowd when a woman was competing and when there was publicity, it was more about how they look then what they could do in the water. Then came Lisa Anderson. Although she did not wear a bikini in the water, she was still pretty and femanine. Interviewing my dad, he believes that if Lisa Anderson was not pretty, she would not have made such an impact on surfing culture. Her parents did not support her surfing either. She ended up running away. One would have to think was this because she was a girl in a male sport? Would she have her parents' support if she were a boy? She was an aggressive surfer who started to get attention around 1997 and was bringing female surfing to life. Lisa Anderson still looked like a girl and did not change her appearance for surfing. She was not trying to fit into a man\u2019s sport but was trying to be a woman in the sport of surfing. Even though Lisa Anderson started to get attention and could surf, she still carried the stereotype, she is \u201cgood for a girl\u201d. She was not looked at to be on the same level as the guys and in all honesty she was not nearly as good of the male professionals at the time. During the early 90\u2019s, there was even a time that women\u2019s surfing was cancelled but the men's competition and the bikini contest still happened (Girls Can\u2019t Surf, 2020). I would argue this would not happen today.\nMy brother and I grew up in a different era but in the same surf culture. When we began surfing, we were young and there were not a lot of surfer girls. However, by the time I turned 13, this had changed. There were girls and boys in the water and we surfed together without any issues or ill feelings. We did not tell the girls they were bad and did not belong here. On the contrary, we welcomed them and enjoyed having them out in the water. We were raised with girl surfers in the water. They are a part of the surfing community. They have been backed by sponsorships and compete at high levels. The girls are just as aggressive as the boys. Locally, there is not much difference between a boy and girl surfer. It is evident now how surfing is more accepting to females. \nGender inequality is evident in all cultures. In West and Zimmerman\u2019s article, Do Gender, men and women have differences, \u201cdifferences seemingly supported by the division of labor into women\u2019s and men\u2019s work...men are men and women are women\u201d (p. 128). There are stereotypes for women and men in our society.  Women are not supposed to compete in a \u201cmen\u2019s sport\u201d.  Men are strong while women do not have the same ability.   As we talk in class about the ranks of the people you have, the white male leads everything and that is like being in first place. Then you have black males and white women. Then the last is black women. This is kind of the list for everything and just how people look at other people. Although gender differences do exist, the rank between men and women is starting to shrink as well as the gender roles are changing everyday in the surf world.  In the surfing world, men were dominant.  Women were not welcomed and treated negatively.  \nIn a 2017 op-ed for The Guardian, the seven-time world champion Layne Beachley described how from her first days of learning to surf to her years on the pro circuit in the 1990s, she and other women were heavily harassed, discriminated against, and paid a fraction of what their men competitors earned. \u201cI was teased, cut off, told to get out of the water because I was a girl, advised that girls don\u2019t surf, and to go mind the towel on the beach,\u201d Beachley wrote of her early years surfing. \u201cThese encounters taught me to stand up and fight for what I believed in. (Baird, 2019)\n\n\nMany times when a sport has a women\u2019s division, they are thought of outside of their gender roles. \u201cMen positioned athletic women as dangerous and masculines lesbians\u201d (Essell, p.115).  This is a common thread when men look at women athletes. Essell discusses in Barbie Dolls that the Rugby players felt they needed to show their femininity since the rules of the game were the same for both male and females and the sport is tough. \u201cRugby is unique among women\u2019s sports in having the same rules and  equipment as  the  men\u2019s  game.  The  sport  offered  identity  resources  for  the  women,  as athletes, because of its hypermasculine structure and style of play\u201d (p. 112). Surfing also follows the same rules no matter what gender you are.  When women first started to surf, they did not show their femininity but focused on being tough and masculine to fit into the surfing world. The men surfers did not accept women surfers and made it clear in interviews and out in the water (Girls Can\u2019t Surf, 2020). Lisa Anderson started to change women\u2019s surfing.  She showed that beautiful women can be surfers. She did not wear a bikini but still showed her beauty.  Now there are a lot of female professional surfers that do not have that hypermasculine side to them. They dress like women and act like women. They are aggressive in the water. That may be compared to being masculine but they are not. However, the surfing world started to use beauty as an identity for women.  The surf culture did not think women had a place in surfing and should look attractive.  Magazines took pictures of women\u2019s butts for ad campaigns not there surfing.  Rebecca Woods' sponsor even dropped her because she did not fit the profile. \u201cIn a 2016 piece on Australia\u2019s ABC, the former pro surfer Rebecca Woods detailed how she was dropped by her sponsor Billabong because, she said, they favored surfers who wore bikinis and looked like models\u201d (Baird, 2019). As a result, the gender in-equality continued by using women who \u201clooked like models\u201d instead of women who surfed. Male surfers made comments like about the women surfers never being as good as men and needing to look like women. (Girls Can\u2019t Surf, 2020)\t\nSurfing is making efforts in gender equality. Locally and in the professional world. In 2019, the World Surf League (WSL) established equal prize money for men and women surfers.  The greatest surfer of all time, Kelly Slater supported the movement for women by saying, \u201cThe women on the tour deserve this change. I'm so proud that surfing is choosing to lead sports in equality and fairness. The female WSL athletes are equally committed to their craft as the male athletes and should be paid the same\u201d (WSL, 2018). Slater is an icon to surfing and his support shows surfers the respect women are getting.  WSL also made more changes than just the prize money. CEO Sophie Goldschmidt explained, \u201cThis is the latest in a series of actions the League has undertaken to showcase our female athletes, from competing on the same quality waves as the men, to better locations, and increased investment and support\u201d (WSL, 2018).  The organization has moved women\u2019s events to combine with the men or to better surf spots. The sport has begun to show women as athletes not supermodels. Sponsors and magazines are showing women surfing and not focusing on what they are wearing. They are earning respect for the sport and women\u2019s ability. However, there are still some differences.  Women are still not on the same level as the males when competing. You can really see it through the highschool surf team. National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) does not allow girls to have the same number of surfers. A NSSA high school surf team consists of two female surfers, 6 male surfers and one long board surfer who can be male or female.  Even if you have females that are better than the males and are willing to surf on the men\u2019s team, NSSA high school national competition will not allow for this change. They are concerned that boys will want to join the girls' event. This shows that there is still room to grow where gender is concerned. The skill level between males and females are different and as a result, there is still a gender separation. This has hurt my high school surf team. When I joined the surf team 5 years ago, the girls' competition was about standing up on a board. The girls were not good surfers. My Sophomore year, a freshman girl joined the team and she was a decent surfer. An even better surfer joined the surf team my junior year. By my senior year, we had too many girls who could surf and the surfer who competed my sophomore and junior year, who placed each year, had to sit out of the state competition due to the talent of the girls on our team. This is even more challenging this year. There are 4 girls who could compete but only 2 are permitted. Throughout this time, in 5 years, I have seen the change and respect for the girl surfers. Truly we were trying to get them to surf with the boys due to the talent they have. I witnessed a change at the NSSA competition. Girls are getting better and gaining respect. The girls are not just able to stand up, they are good surfers. One can see the respect and how surfing has grown on females through the talent and how much better the females are at surfing then the females that surfed a while ago. \t\nThe talent level has also grown not just on a small scale of a highschool surf team but also at the professional level. Women surfers are getting better and better. The boys have been throwing airs in contests for years and it is one of the most entertaining things about surfing. Carissa Moore landed the first air in female pro surfing \nApril 9, 2021. This was being talked about in the surfing world and was a great accomplishment. This shows a step and improvement in women's surfing. The male surfers also praised her when she did this. They did not mock her accomplishment or make fun of her like Layne Beachley experienced in 1990 instead they congratulated her. Women surfers have been publicly recognized by their male peers.  In John John Florence\u2019s instagram, he congratulates Carissa on winning the world tour.  He even posts her wave during the competition. This shows that women are also getting more respect from their male peers at the highest level of surfing.      \nThe difference in men and women pro surfing is the judging of the waves and the scores that the women get compared to the men in competitions. The women scoring criteria is easier than the men. A perfect example is going back to Carrissa Moore and landing an air reverse. She got a 9.9 but if a male surfer were to do that in a contest it would not be looked at as special.  However, if a guy did the air Carissa did he wouldn\u2019t get any praise. Actually, he would not get any recognition. I do believe we will see this change as more female surfers start to do more radical moves in the water. For now, this difference continues to separate the genders and provide inequality. As the girls get better, so do the boys so the gap in ability continues to exist and expand. \nWIth the WSL supporting women surfers and making a stance financially for equality, the gender inequality gap should shrink. This shows that the highest level of competition for surfers believes that female surfing is important. There has also been a change for surf clinics for girls.  The WSL has added clinics to the tour for girl surfers and is going to clear the beach for these clinics. This shows progress from the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s when women were treated poorly in the water and not recognized for their surfing ability.  Surfers are more respectful now and more welcoming. It will be nice to see the movement in the future. Unfortunately, the gap still exists since there are more male than female competition.\nAs stated throughout this paper, the gender difference in surfing is moving in the right direction. There are more female surfers at the local level, more opportunities with female clinics for young surfers and equal pay for those that surf professionally.  The male counterparts are recognizing female surfers as talented.  They are congratulating them and supporting them instead of telling them to get out of the water. When professionals make change, so do the more local communities. Female surfers are continuing to be more and more accepted in the surf culture. Although there is still work to do in the surfing world between the male and female population, surfing is moving to close the gender inequality gap.\n\n\nWork Cited\nBaird, Saxon. \u201cWhy Female Surfers Are Finally Getting Paid like Their Mail Peers.\u201d \nThe Atlantic, Atlantic Media Company, 15 Apr. 2019, \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/how-female-surfers-won-pay-equity-fight/587065/. \nEzzell, Matthew B. \u201c\u2018Barbie Dolls\u2019 on the Pitch: Identity Work, Defensive Othering, and \nInequality in Women's Rugby.\u201d Social Problems, vol. 56, no. 1, 2009, pp. 111\u2013131., https://doi.org/10.1525/sp.2009.56.1.111. \nMondy, Ben. \u201cThe Greatest Female Surfers of All Time.\u201d Surf Europe, 4 Jan. 2018,\t\nhttps://surfeuropemag.com/features/greatest-female-surfers-time.html. \nNelius, Christopher, director.

        "text": "In the essay, \u201cMicrofoundations,\u201d the writer points out that ritual burial began happening some point after the 50,000-45,000 years ago mark as evidenced by the Sungir site in Russia that dates a ritual burial that occurred 28,000 years ago for two young people and a 60-year-old male. The significance of this is the evidence of large groups working together for the complex ornamentation of the bodies, each with 3,000 ivory beads that appeared to have taken over an hour to make one single bead, and large mammoth tusks that were boiled to be straightened out on either side of all the bodies. The complex ornamentation and ritual burial then also point to the concept of religion at this time, which is something is not evidenced before the 50,000-year mark for early humans. This essay points to language perhaps being the catalyst for Humans creating the first early animist religions. As in both essays they cite religion as a type of refuge for social beings and in, \u201cThe Neurology of Religion,\u201d it is seen that religion is responsible for the organizing of rituals, burials in the case of the last essay, within a community. Which to carry out such complicated, coordinated efforts, it is likely that language would have had to come first to create a religion to become a collective for either tribes or groups of early Humans to rally behind so as to become a part of it. \nPrior to 50,000 years ago humans did not have a capacity for complex speech that modern humans had that kept them in the same playing field as Neanderthals and other Hominids. But when the capacity was gained for complex speech, a rise in early Humans\u2019 abilities to form animist religions sparked the beginning of the complex collective consciousnesses that would eventually make up modern human civilization and put Humans ahead of other Hominids.",

        "text": "Ava Lowry\nSOC 105-001\nOctober 18, 2021\n\nThe Sociological Concept of \u201cThe Stage\u201d and How it is used to Demonstrate The Presentation of Self\n\nWhy do we act the way we do in social situations and how can the presentation of self be illustrated? \u201cThe Stage'' is an analogy presented by the Sociologist Erving Goffman, as a means to demonstrate the presentation of self. Life is just one big series of performances. Through this concept, the presentation of self becomes as simplistic as understanding the different components of theatre. In essence, the way any one person acts is based on what they believe their audience wants to see from them. It is essential for everyone to keep their \u201ccharacter\u201d intact through each and every performance, and for them to assist others in their performances. For these reasons, \u201cThe Stage\u201d is a very straightforward way to illustrate the presentation of self. We act the way we do because we are the performers on stage, and we must do what we believe the audience wants us to do given our character and the props available to us. Understanding why we do what we do is the first step in improving the way social interactions are carried out, and result in the formation of new interpersonal relationships. Through this concept we can gain understanding in how identity is self made and interaction based. \nThe goal of the performer is to please their audience and stay in character while on stage. \nWhether it is genuine or not, it is the performers duty to give their audience a specific impression. In my case, I strive to give others the impression that I am a caring person who can and will be there for almost anyone. Although this is a pretty conscious effort that I make through social interactions, I feel that it is a facet of my true self. I genuinely care for others and want to give anyone a shoulder to lean on, just as I would hope others would do for me. However, for some people keeping up their character involves less than authentic interactions. There are times when it can be apparent to others that their reasoning is not genuine. For myself and many others, detecting such actions has become almost second nature- although some people are better at hiding their true intentions than others. This skill is very useful when distinguishing genuine actions from ingenuine actions, thus preventing negative outcomes from social interactions. It is especially useful when making interpersonal and/or romantic relationships. \nMany social interactions are ridden with embarrassment, misunderstanding, and unnecessary aggressions because we do not understand why we ourselves and others do and say what they do. So, if this inability to understand other reasoning for their actions is eliminated from the equation, we are left with viable social interactions that result in the understanding of one another and the formation of relationships. For example, embarrassment occurs when someone strays from the contents of their \u201ccharacter\u201d. According to Goffman it is our duty to assist others in keeping their character intact, and that embarrassment feels awkward for all involved. Knowing why embarrassment occurs will allow us to assist others and ourselves with staying in character, and commending the emergence of our true selves when someone becomes embarrassed in social interactions. Because acting on the stage is an effort which is made through any and every social interaction, it can become tiring. Although it can and is an unnoticed human practice by many, it still requires mental effort, and therefore it will be mentally tiring. The solution to this is as simple as assisting and comforting others while socially interacting. By helping others avoid embarrassment or misunderstandings, you help yourself avoid such occurrences too. I myself make efforts to comfort others when they feel embarrassed, or are involved in some sort of misunderstanding. Even if I do not consider myself a friend of that person, I believe that it is possible to relate myself to almost anyone, and find the compassion to help them in a time of need. How can I better understand this person's actions? How can I put myself in their shoes? By asking these questions and interacting we can better understand others' reasoning behind their actions which leads to less embarrassment and misunderstandings. According to Goffman, it is our duty to assist others in their performances, and it is important that all performers are able to recognize the types of roles that each performer is trying to achieve.\nIdentity is self made and interaction based. According to Goffman, it is the coalition of all performances made by the performer, even performances that stray from their character. It is proven that the way people act  \u201cfront stage\u201d or present in a collectively produced social situation, contrats from the way they act \u201cbackstage\u201d or not present in a collectively produced social situation. Identity is also the outcome of the props a performer has available to them, or the circumstances that they perform under. For example, if someone\u2019s character consists of being generous with all they have, and being a supporter and a provider for others, but they\u2019re financials are lacking, they may not be able to perform as consistently with their character as they or others believe they should.  It is also heavily influenced by societal expectations and the collective consciousness. What does society expect from someone who plays their role? What are more specific expectations for their character? These expectations are derived from the collective consciousness. An example of this is the role of the Mother. It is widely thought that Mothers are the caretakers and the nurturers. Society expects Mothers to play this role at all times. Although a Mothers character involves much more specific qualities than these qualities alone, straying from this role is seen as immoral. Identity is the formulation of one's actions when performing and the expectations placed upon them which they are expected to adhere to when performing. \nIn my opinion, \u201cThe Stage '' is the best way to illustrate the presentation of self. This analogy is a good means to visualize the roles we take on in various social situations. There have been multiple occasions where I have questioned my own, and others actions in a specific situation, and this concept has allowed me to gain understanding of these actions. For example, I attended a concert recently and when it came to an end my boyfriend and I walked outside to wait for our ride. I walked over to the band\u2019s bus to see them while my boyfriend looked for our ride. As soon as I left his presence an intoxicated man with a bottle of liquor in hand approached me in a way that made me very uncomfortable. He attempted to convince me to come with him and made comments about my appearance. He did not seem to notice my discomfort through the interaction. Instead of doing what I should have done, I froze. I didn\u2019t become combative when he made inappropriate comments, I simply tried to end the conversation and walk away but the man blocked me from leaving. I eventually managed to get away, but I felt as though I hadn\u2019t acted in the way I should have. Normally, I would have tried to be very stern and get away quickly from the interaction, but at times when I am on my own- I do not have the will to carry myself out of such dangerous situations. I felt a sort of embarrassment knowing that I should have acted differently, and that the situation could have become much worse. A sense of loneliness washed over me as I fled the situation because I realized that no one had come to assist me. By using the concept of \u201cThe Stage\u201d, I can form an understanding of why I felt the way I did when straying from my self made character. I believe that it is because my character resides in social interactions that I am unable to defend myself against such interactions when I am on my own. \nIn conclusion, \u201cThe Stage\u201d is the most fitting concept that can be used to demonstrate the presentation of self. It is a means to simplify and illustrate the presentation of self using the different roles involved in theatre. This concept provides simplistic visuals of the various roles played in social situations. \u201cThe Stage '' is an interaction based concept used to illustrate the presentation of self.  According to the concept, identity is the coalition of performances the performer carries out through social situations. It is collectively produced by everyone involved in helping it emerge and grow. The goal of the performer is to keep their character intact by acting in a way that pleases their audience, and to support others' roles when performing. By supporting and understanding others, we in turn help ourselves. Using this concept to understand the presentation of self can improve social interactions and create new interpersonal relationships. This knowledge can be used in various social situations, and lead to further understanding others and why we do what we do. If we can understand one another, we can avoid or reduce embarrassment, misunderstanding, and unnecessary aggression in social interactions. By helping others avoid these occurrences, we also help to avoid them for ourselves. Social interactions are what keeps society moving and turning, I would even say they are the essence of society. This is why decreasing the occurrence of misunderstanding, embarrassment and unnecessary aggression is so important. In theory, the knowledge of this concept and its application to the real world could improve the fluidity of the inner workings of society. \n\n",

        "text": "The current established belief in America is that if there were classes, the middle class, or the people of America, hold the power of the economy, the government and have equal access to all opportunities. This is a belief that the majority holds more power than the minority, the top 1% of Americans, in all aspects of life. This however, as both Mantsios and Domhoff have written extensively about, is not the reality of our world. As both writers in their articles, \u201cClass in America,\u201d and \u201cDomination Theory of Power,\u201d respectively, debunk and connect data to reveal that wealth and opportunity distribution is not equal among the social classes. Mantsios debunks this myth by going over several different \u201ccases\u201d of middle-class Americans that each make vastly different amounts of money but would consider themselves \u201cmiddle class.\u201d The most striking difference is the difference in opportunities for success and wealth given to the man that made 300k a year and came from a wealthy family vs that of the opportunities given to the man that came from a family that made more than 50% of Americans, and the opportunities that a black woman from just above the poverty line had. The richest man had several properties and went to prestigious private schools where he grew up with the sons and daughters of prominent figures and made it into an Ivy League school and managed to end up an executive at a corporation in New York City. While the other two that went to public school in the less well off parts of New York City never had access to the tutoring and job opportunities that the well off man had. Proving that the true upper class of society, the 1%, is able to maintain their position over the majority of American people via the opportunities they are provided in their lives. While in \u201cDomination Theory of Power,\u201d Domhoff continues to prove this point on the monopoly of opportunities by showing how many people in the top 1% of society are a part of the same clubs, organizations, and send their children in the same school so the wealthy stick with the wealthy in terms of education and social spheres. Further showing how difficult it is to break into that class from the outside looking in, especially when both writers reveal that this system is supported not by a third of the country\u2019s wealth, like what might be expected of the 1% to own, but of almost 40% of America\u2019s wealth is held by the upper class of American society proving that the power does not belong with the majority, but with the minority in terms of wealth and opportunities.\nThe United States holds a shared belief perpetuated in our collective consciousness that we live in a classless, equal, society where power is held by the majority middle class. This, is far from the truth as both opportunities for education and careers and the distribution of wealth is skewed greatly towards the 1% of America that truly hold the power.",

        "text": "\tFor centuries, society has had gender norms. The men were in power, the women were beneath them, and most of the time, submitted to the man and his needs. Even thousands of years later, the foundations of the United States only had a group of men writing the Constitution, the foundation of a country, allowing for a bias that has now been normalized in societies. In the past couple decades, the world has been working on correcting the systemic racism, stigma in mental health, women in power, and with finding better ways of accepting those who identify in the LGBTQ2+ community. People in the LGBTQ2+ community often act and look differently than the gender roles and norms that society puts on them. This often results in upset and angry people who believe in tradition and are uncomfortable with change. These people are often hiding their homophobia, sexism, and other forms of hatred and end up hurting people in this community. There are several types of abuse that are often seen to be more prevalent for teens in the community than those who are straight. Most common, sexual trauma. Sexual trauma is reported by many to be a much higher percentage by those who identify in the community, and most of them also admitting it happened in their young, crucial, formative years. For clarity, there is no significant correlation that sexual trauma will not determine a person\u2019s sexuality, but instead that those in the community are more vulnerable to these types of abuse. In this paper, I will be explaining the effect on teens who are in the community that have defied and stood up against gender norms, and the consequences that many teens, who are still children, are facing daily, just because of who they are. These teens who are still trying to figure out life in general are also fighting to figure themselves out, while also having to live by the traditional gender norms and \u201cdoing gender\u201d. \n\u201cDoing Gender\u201d is the idea that you will live your life while being assessed by society and the people that surround you, even if they don\u2019t know you. This is often associated with gender norms and the stereotypes that men and women are separately supposed to fulfill. Activities and outward appearances with masculine features, like walking people across the street or carrying something heavy are considered a man\u2019s job, while sitting and looking pretty is more for a female. Females aren\u2019t expected to be loud or dress a certain way because it seems manly, but skirts aren\u2019t correct for men because its \u201cfeminine\u201d. These types of gender roles seem minimal, but since it has been engrained in our brains and society, it has become a tradition that many people are unwilling to change, leading to different types of violence. Next, I will be sharing a couple of personal stories of those I know in the community who have been abused and witnessed violence because of the fact that they were subject to gender norms.\n*Names have been changed to protect the privacy of those who allowed me to use their stories*\nAnnie\u2019s Story: Annie had grown up in a very Christian conservative household. No sex, no lying, no cussing, waiting until marriage until you could marry a man. She had a hard time going out on dates because her parents worried about how she may get hurt while she goes out. They were hard on her and expected her to keep up with their strict expectations. Before high school, she had only dated 2 guys. Both of which she didn\u2019t connect too much with, but she thought it may be just because she couldn\u2019t see them often. She went to a private Christian school where she was extremely sheltered. She then transferred to a public high school where the transition was difficult and a brutal culture shock later learning she couldn\u2019t trust everyone she thought she could. She still believed she needed guys for validation because of an abusive home life and not really knowing herself. She trusted one guy who ended up blackmailing her to sexually assault and rape her for over a year. She felt like she couldn\u2019t tell anyone because her offender was black, and her parents were racist. Her parents would not support her, and she couldn\u2019t tell an adult without getting the parents involved since she was still a minor. Her coach noticed her panic attacks when her offender would walk in and figured there was something wrong. Throughout the time, she had to find peace and a home somewhere else. She allowed vulnerability with dating women and is now bisexual. She has told me that this is where she feels safe. She is now in college, away from her parents, where her roommates accept her, and she has noted how much better her mental health has been since she has been in college. I asked her if she ever acted differently or dressed differently around men to keep herself safe, and she didn\u2019t hesitate with saying yes. She will dress more masculine some days or be \u201cone of the boys\u201d so that they won\u2019t try and do what happened to her during her freshmen and sophomore year of high school. She has stated that there have been men who harass her for not being feminine and polite like many women are expected to do. \nReagan\u2019s Story: Reagan had grown up in a very broken home. She grew up in an African cultured home where the father had many wives and felt as though he could do anything at the demise of the women. While growing up in Islam, her father molested her as a child. She was and witnessed being abused and her mother being abused as well. I personally knew her well for the past couple years and have had to pick her up from her home because she didn\u2019t feel safe. Reagan identifies as lesbian and has for as long as she can remember. She also dresses masculine because that\u2019s what is comfortable, and how she feels safer. She has been through several therapists, medications, and attempts to end her life. Her family does not accept her for not being feminine and not dating men and it something she struggles with every day. She has had sisters who have had arranged marriages with men and is hoping to break this cycle of the gender norm that the female is expected to submit to the man and live to work for his pleasure at home. \nIn history, those who did not follow the standard of being straight and doing what traditions told them to, have been redefining gender roles, but against a brutal force. Many people in the community have been seen as not real men or women due to the fact they don\u2019t follow the set gender roles that are aligned with their genitalia. Many gender transgressors are marked in society and deal with intense abuse including verbal and physical violence, scrutiny, and community gossip. Many of those who enforce gender norms often have an \u201canti-gay attitude\u201d. According to Delores Smith, who works in the Department of Child and Family Studies in Tennessee, found that things like this can cause the allowance of \u201ccorrective rape\u201d, specifically for lesbians, to be subject to forced sex with a man to \u201ccure\u201d them of their sexual identity. Adults and supervisors who are supposed to be protecting these youth have found that there has been a downplay of harassment of lesbians. A study done where they interviewed several lesbians and their experience showed they have gone against gender norms, but some will change just so that they \u201cpass\u201d as straight. Michael Ferrera, a Clinical Director of Group Homes for Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services says that \u201cThe girls who can pass have an easier time\u2026The lipstick lesbians are objectified, but the butch girls ger challenged all the time. The butch lesbians have the hardest time\u201d. The Human Right Watch found that the majority of girls, regardless of their sexual orientation are sexually harassed, making bisexual or lesbian females feel as though they cannot turn to school officials for not protecting girls from the sexual harassment by boys in school. However, with who did turn to other students or service providers, it was consistently noted that girls who failed to conform to the gender stereotypes and normality\u2019s set on them were the most targeted. There was a theory offered as an explanation to why these girls are not accepted, and it was called the inversion theory. Inversion theory is mostly self-explanatory, where there was inborn reversal of gender traits among that person or group of people. This, however, is something that is not accepted among people that follow the traditions of the past, and don\u2019t feel comfortable in the changes of society and the growing acceptance and destigmatizing of the LGBTQ2+ community. \n\tWith the stories and evidence above, there is personal and statistical evidence that sexual assault is common throughout the community. While sexual assault happens to every type of person, studies have shown that the frequency of the events happens higher in the LGBTQ2+ community. According to the CDC, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people experience sexual violence at similar and higher rates than straight people. The CDC\u2019s conducted a study and found that 44% of lesbians and 61% of bisexual women have experienced some form of sexual violence including rape, physical violence, or stalking compared to the 35% of straight women. Bisexual women have the highest percent of rape being at 46% compared to 17% of straight women and 13% of lesbians. Another survey found that LGBQ teens and those who are questioning their sexuality face twice the risk of physical violence compared to straight teens. Not only were these stats much higher, but studies have also delved into child sexual abuse for women and men in the community. Prevalence ranged as high as 76% of women and 59% of men who identified as gay or bisexual. These numbers are all comparatively high to straight men and women. \n\tLGBTQ2+ teens have experienced several forms of abuse, many have challenged the gender norms, and are fighting to stay safe. As stated before, many admit to the fact that sometimes they will change just so that they \u201cpass\u201d to avoid being harassed by other people. In the article we read in class \u201cDoing Gender\u201d, the authors talked about what doing gender was, and ongoing accomplishments among people who didn\u2019t fit the gender norms, but still adjusted to society. One example they gave was of someone named Agnes. Agnes was born with male genitalia, but she believed that she was born as a female in a male body. She studied the female and wanted to be undeniably female to society. She had to study what were the \u201cnot talked about ruled\u201d for females in society and would have to learn what to do even making sure not to overstep. She had bottom surgery and learned the way of life as a female which is why the authors considered her a gender accomplishment - she became \u201cpassing\u201d.\n\tGender norms have been an influence on society for centuries, and is not destined to change much soon. With society destigmatizing mental illness, women in power, people in the community, and several other things, there will always be a group against it. They believe in traditions and would like to keep it that way. Many people are uncomfortable with change and having the awkward conversations about the bias that flows through society and our brains since it was systematically built into the foundations of our country. With this, they act violently, and do whatever it takes to stop others from being what is outside of the gender norms of society. However, \u201cDoing Gender\u201d shows that no matter who you are, society will set the stereotypes on you even when you are doing daily tasks, so while keeping yourself and loved ones safe, there\u2019s no point of being no one else but who you want to be, and how you best feel comfortable and confident.

        "text": "Soc\n3/31/2021\nDisillusionment\n\tYuval Noah Harari is the writer of the book 21 Lesions for the 21st Century.  He begins the book with the concept of Disillusionment. He claims that as things get more convoluted and complicated, people stop paying attention. We like simple stories. This goes with the concept of Ockham\u2019s Razor; the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. For Harari, this is one of the explanations for why people just don\u2019t seem to be active in solving the world\u2019s problems, we just don\u2019t know where to start. Also, we have much more immediate personal pressing matters. We must pay bills; we have mouths to feed. So why would we care and pay attention to Class in America when we are just trying to get by?\n\tThe few who take time to dissect and pay attention to how the class system is meant to provide heavily to the power elite and leave table scraps throughout the middle class who are too preoccupied with other things that the power elite dish out to them to realize that something is terribly wrong with the class system. The people in power realize that if the working class wanted to overthrow them, they very easily could. The key is to divide the working class along any means necessary to prevent them from organizing and uniting against the unjust class system and the power elite. To Liberal America, conservatives are the enemy and vise versa. As long as they can prevent open and free dialogue from between the isle from happening, they will. This will keep the working class disillusioned with the real problem of class in America. Keep them distracted and complicate the problems as much as you can so they throw their hand up in the air and give up on trying to understand and solve the problem. \n\tHavari\u2019s concept of Disillusionment applies to many other aspects of life. The formula is simple. Those in positions of power and create untrue and confusing narratives and as a result people will stop paying attention, or grasp onto the most simple and easy explanation. ",

        "text": "American Scheme\n\tHow skewed is the distribution of wealth really in America? Everyone is taught that this country gives everyone equal opportunities as long as you work hard. But the truth is, no matter how hard you work the likelihood of growing up the class system is close to none. Most people don\u2019t know this, but the 1% of Americans own 40% of the country's wealth, which is around 21.6 trillion dollars. The top 80-99% own 53%, leaving the bottom 80% of the country with only 7% (3.78 trillion). This distribution of wealth is extremely unjust, and it is hidden from most people to hide the motives of this country. \n\tThe key word people in the public eye use to hide this is \u201cmiddle class.\u201d Everyone who has a job is considered middle class. But why are they held to the same standard? Someone who works as a doctor makes enough money to go on unlimited vacations, splurge on unessentials, and never has to worry about debt. Yet someone who works as a teacher struggles to pay rent, has a side job, and is still paying off her student loans from school. These two people should not be categorized together, but they are. The majority of people place themselves in the general term of \u201cmiddle class,\u201d because they are afraid to admit that the country's wealth is favored towards making the rich richer. \n\tI have experienced this unequal distribution of wealth first hand. I am a lower middle class student, and my parents worked hard to make me live an average life. I work in a restaurant here in Wilmington, where I make a $4 hourly salary. I work hard, sometimes finding myself catching my breath and seeing burn marks, bruises, and sweat covering my body after each shift. Yet when I see the managers sitting in an office, going through files, making a schedule; they make ten times what I do. How is that fair? They certainly don\u2019t work ten times harder than I do. The same goes for ceo\u2019s of a company; they make 380 times what their average worker\u2019s salary is, but is their job really 380 times harder? What is the purpose of boasting about his American Dream that hard work will get you far when those that work the hardest get the short end of the stick? The American Dream is advertised to get the country's lower class workers to do the dirty jobs that need to be done that no one else wants to do. Wealth comes more commonly through luck or inheritance, certainly not hard work. \n\tI gain a lot of insight by serving the rich. They tend to be stuck up, judgemental, and usually have something to complain about. I work in a restaurant with ocean views and quality food and service. Yet, rich customers still tend to come in with smug looks on their face like they are too good to be there. I will never forget this one table, the second I approach them I get interrupted before I could even tell them my name. \u201cIced water with lemon on the side and a glass of chardonnay\u201d she said, barely making eye contact. I noticed an extremely shiny necklace along with rings that probably cost more than my tuition. After I get their drinks, they make comments about things on the menu that they would never get. The lady finally orders but makes numerous changes to how the food is prepared, saying she doesn\u2019t like spice but wants extra vegetables. When the food comes out, I hear her say \u201cwhat is that,\u201d in the snootiest tone I\u2019ve ever heard. I explain to her that the fish pan seared, and she says it doesn\u2019t look right, since her husband got the blackened. \u201cI wanted what my husband got,\u201d she says immediately. I have to hold in my emotions and take a breath before responding to people like this. \u201cYour husband got the blackened grouper, which is spicy. I can bring out a side of blackened seasoning for you if you would like.\u201d \u201cNo, you can just take it back.\u201d I look at her and think about how dumb she is and how dumb I am going to look when I bring this plate back. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll bring you a new one.\u201d I tell the kitchen to make it on the fly, and she is brought a new fish within 5 minutes. I hand her the new dish and ask if she would like anything else. She says no but when I come back she says, \u201cMy fish is cooked strangely, I would like it well done.\u201d When I asked her how she would like it cooked the first time she said medium. \u201cAnd another glass of wine, with extra ice on the side. My ice has been empty for a while and I've seen you come back and forth without refilling it\u201d she hands me her empty glass for ice and grossly smiles. \u201cYes of course,\u201d I responded, biting my tongue. How rude, I think to myself. I walk away, tell the kitchen the fish is well done, and I nearly burn my fingers grabbing the new plate. The lady and her husband are enjoying their meal and I watch her beverages like a hawk, always keeping them refilled and checking up on them. \u201cI want more butter\u201d \u201cWe need more napkins.\u201d \u201cWe need salt and pepper.\u201d \u201cWe need more refills.\u201d She has to be doing this on purpose. She waited until each time I arrived at the table and asked for everything one by one instead of all at once. I didn\u2019t have time to run back and forth 5 separate times. No matter how much I had already on my plate or how busy I got, I still did everything with a smile. It took everything out of me to hand everything to her with a smile and in a nice tone of voice.  When she finally asks for her check, the plate is cleared and the total comes to around $100 for the two of them. I pick up the check, and the tip is zero. \n\tI made zero dollars serving what seemed to be an extremely privileged woman, who I needed extreme patience and diligence to serve. I gave her excellent service and she chose to selfishly get it for free. That woman seemed extremely well off, and clearly I am not since I am a 19 year old server, barely getting by. I often find myself frustrated when it comes to dealing with rich people who inherited their parents' wealth. They don\u2019t know what it is like to struggle, and probably never will. They don\u2019t know about basic human decency, or about the little things in life and how money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. The fact that someone could group us in the same category as \u201cmiddle class,\u201d is absurd. Nobody wants to admit that there are more than 3 classes, and those who aren\u2019t part of the top classes have little to no chance of moving up. There are hundreds of multi-billionaires in the U.S., yet for someone who makes the average salary ($35,672) it would take them 28,033 years or 400 lifetimes just to make $1 billion. Those who work harder jobs are essential in making this country run, yet are compensated little to nothing.\n\tThe distribution of wealth in this country makes people like the woman I served, continue to treat others in a horrible manner. She is a prime example of showing how selfish the rich are with their money, and how they\u2019ll do anything to keep it to themselves. The higher powers have found a way to continue this scheme, all through the word of \u201cmiddle class.\u201d By saying that the majority of the country is in one class, they hide the fact that the majority of the country's wealth goes to the 1%, and those who have inherited wealth are better off than those who work hard. It is a shame that a girl like me has to see this the hard way, how I have to suffer through the treatment of those who will never know what it is like to be on the other side of this spectrum. I hope one day the real American Dream is exposed, and there is action taken to change the system of letting the rich take what should be distributed to those who work harder than them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \nMantsios, Gregory.

In particular as a minority in the United States it often affects you in negative ways. Minorities are looked at differently, they deal with discrimination and racial inequalities on a daily basis. While on the other hand white people don't have to deal with the same discrimination and unfair treatment. This idea of races being treated differently is from the racial formation.  ",

This coupled with the endlessly improving technology creates an interesting relationship between social media and politics. It is common knowledge at this point that most people get their news from some form of social media, predominantly twitter. This is interesting given 20 years ago traditional media was still unchallenged in its monopoly over stories and coverage. First let us define what the traditional media is. It includes television, radio, newspapers, magazines, newsletters, tax press, and other print publications. Compare this to new media, this definition is not as concrete as the other, but it includes blogs, podcasts, websites, and any internet related form of communication. I want to compare the two in the current age where a viral tweet will get more views than CNN and discover how this has impacted current Global politics.\n\tTraditional media has been on the decline since the invention of the internet. The true nail in the coffin was the events of the 2016 American election. As David Morris puts it in his article, Twitter Versus the Traditional Media: A Survey Experiment Comparing Public Perceptions of Campaign Messages in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, \u201cPrior to the 2016 presidential election, the assumption was that campaign messages sent through the traditional media are perceived as more influential, believable, and motivating by the public\u201d (Morris). People had an attraction to hearing what a candidate had to say directly from the source as opposed to hearing a perhaps misleading interpretation of what they said. They found it more credible to see what the candidates were tweeting themselves. In this particular instance we see that the amount of information taken in was not limited by \u201cby the hour\u201d shows or stories that were predetermined to be ran in a television broadcast. Someone who followed Hillary Clinton on twitter could find out exactly what she was saying the minute she said it. This also cuts down on any amount of spin that any news station could put onto a tweet of a candidate to promote an agenda with disinformation.  To further break down how the primary forms of how voters would get their information, compare the two most popular forms of media in new and traditional, twitter and television. According to a study done by Gottfried and Shearer in 2016, 90% of adults use the internet and social media sites are used by a vast majority of Americans. Of the 90%, 16% had an active twitter account. Of the 16%, 60% reported primarily getting their news information from twitter when it came to the election. However, \u201cmost Americans still view traditional media outlets as the most useful and effective conduits to get information on presidential races\u201d (Morris).  To connect this to our class, Harari talks about the importance of information and technology and the specific effects it has on the autonomy of the individual. On the surface the ability to choose the type of media you would like to receive seems like it would increase your autonomy. However, if you chose what you want to read, most are only going to choose what agrees with them which can increase political polarization through confirmation bias and echo chambers. This might ultimately cause a decrease in individual autonomy.\n\n\tThe last two decades have seen a revolution in information. The rise of applications such as Facebook and Twitter have massively changed the way that people think and organize specifically when talking about politics. For example, in his journal; New Media, New Civics?, Ethan Zuckerman opens his piece with an example from Egypt, \n\u201cFor some, this photo was proof positive that the Internet had helped oust Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and was showing its power in allowing people to organize for political change. For others, it was evidence that the self\u2010importance of Internet advocates had gotten out of hand. After all, the Arab Spring in Egypt had far more to do with economic factors and popular dissatisfaction than with any specific communications technology\u201d (Zuckerman).\nThe photo referring to an Egyptian man holding a sign that says \u201cFacebook\u201d. Whether you believe in that specific cause or not, it is inarguable that new media had a hand in the action that happened. This touches on an important advantage that new media has over traditional media; its flexibility and accessibility. You can create a group of people who all think the same thing and organize a movement. This movement does not even have to be a physical location or place, it can be a purely online movement full of posts that can gain ground and more followers. This can also be a disadvantage and may offer an answer to why most people still trust traditional media more than they do new media. A malicious online movement can create discourse and confusion with misinformation campaigns. When people know that they cannot argue against something that they disagree with, they will make online noise to disrupt the true meaning of whatever it is they are trying to disrupt.  Again, to connect to Harari, being a citizen in the 21st century can be very difficult because we must wade through all this online fluff to get to what we really want.\n\tHow has people view and engagement in politics changed? Specifically due to the rise of new media. For the most part I think had has created a more polarized political climate specifically in America. People wither wear a red or blue jersey and act accordingly to what people who they align with politically act, even if they do not agree with a particular issue. People are willing to put aside their personal view to feel like they belong to a group. This again connects to Harari\u2019s claim of loss of autonomy. Say you are a conservative republican who is pro-choice and make it very clear of that on social media. The conservatives will oust you for not aligning with all their conservative views and the liberal will not accept you for not aligning with all of their liberal views. This leads to a feeling of isolation in the political world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBruhn, Manfred, Verena Schoenmueller, and Daniela B.

        "text": "The racial disparity in our prison systems\nRacial inequalities and racial disparities can be seen in lots of things in the United States. You can see racial inequalities in the education system, in the economy, and in the government. There have been multiple recent reminders of racial discrimination and its existence all over the world. For example how society tends to view minorities in a negative way compared to whites. The prison system is a great example of racial disparity.\nToday there is a clear racial disparity in the United States prison system. There is a disproportionate amount of African Americans that are incarcerated. This is a serious problem considering that the United States has the largest prison population in the world. This racial disparity in the prison system has many contributing factors. In the past there has been crime policies put in place to target blacks and other minorities. Another factor is that minorities tend to receive more harsh sentences in criminal trials. These racial disparities can also be seen with our court and justice system and how different people are sentenced. As well as in our police system by how different people are stopped and questioned by police officers. \n\tThe United States prison population is much larger than any other country in the world. The majority of inmates that are incarcerated are African American. Hetey states, \u201cBlacks are the most imprisoned of all groups. Though they comprise only 12% of the U.S. population, Blacks are nearly 40% of the nation\u2019s inmates, with some researchers estimating that more than one in four Black men will spend time behind bars (Bonczar & Beck, 1997; Western, 2006).\u201d This number is disproportionate considering that black people are a minority in America. This shows that there is racial disparity in the prison system and the court system. \n\tEveryone in the United States has the right to a fair trial. But blacks are more likely to receive a longer sentence for the same crime than whites. This racial bias has been implemented in the court system for a long time. Ingraham states, \u201cBlack men who commit the same crimes as white men receive federal prison sentences that are, on average, nearly 20 percent longer, according to a new report on sentencing disparities from the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC).\u201d The sentence that is given to the criminal is almost always determined by the judge. Which means that judges play a large part in why African Americans are given longer sentences than whites. This being said almost all of the state and federal judges are white men. Ingraham also states, \u201cJudges are less likely to voluntarily revise sentences downward for black offenders than for white ones, in other words. And even when judges do reduce black offenders' sentences, they do so by smaller amounts than for white offenders.\u201d This harsher sentencing towards blacks leads to more black people being incarcerated and for long amounts of time. These racial disparities can also be seen in the parole and release program. With whites having a better chance of getting released from prison on parole than blacks and other minorities. This shows racial disparity because of the larger number of African Americans that are incarcerated. Also that white people are more likely to get probation instead of prison time than black people.\nAfrican Americans and other minorities are more likely to be stopped by the police. This can include being stopped and questioned on the street and being stopped by police while driving. There is clear evidence that shows that blacks or other minorities are more likely to be involved in a police stop. Kovera states, \u201cFor example, in North Carolina, which has collected data on traffic stops since 1999, the odds of being stopped by police while driving were higher for Blacks than for Whites or Hispanics (Baumgartner, Epp, & Shoub, 2018). Moreover, the odds of a Black driver appearing in the NC traffic stop data were 60\u201370% higher than the odds of a Black driver in the population in which the traffic stop occurred.\u201d This higher rate of police stops for African American is due to the racial bias that some people have. \nThe racial bias that people have is a negative stereotype that black people are violent and dangerous. This negative stereotype can be seen all over the world. Mitchell states, \u201cFor example, Devine (1989) in an early study found that respondents regardless of their level racial prejudice as measured by the Modern Racism Scale were knowledgeable about racial stereotypes, and respondents noted that blacks were stereotyped as \u201chostile\u201d and \u201ccriminal-like\u201d (p. 9).\u201d The racial stereotype can also be seen in reports of people calling the police on African Americans for doing nothing wrong, to the multiple incidents where African Americans have been shot by police at traffic stops. For example Kovera states, \u201cExperimental studies confirmed that unarmed Black men face a greater risk of being shot by mistake than do unarmed White men, a phenomenon known as shooter bias (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002).\u201d That bias is why some black men and women fear for their lives when they encounter police. This is because the police tend to have two different meanings for most black and white people. For most white people the police are there to keep you and your community safe, while for some black people the police are there to interrogate you and suspect you of a crime. These two different perspectives of how the police are viewed is from what people have experienced today and in the past.        \nAnother variable that led to mass incarceration of African Americans was the war on drugs. The war on drugs was a movement started by president Nixon and then later led by president Reagan that focused on stopping the illegal use of drugs. This movement implemented more harsh and longer sentences for minor drug charges. The war on drugs targeted blacks and other minorities in particular. By making known illegal drug use was a serious issue, minor drug charges turned into major prison sentences. Mitchell states, \u201cAmericans of all racial backgrounds have been affected by the current War on Drugs; yet, minorities, particularly African-Americans, have borne the brunt of the war (Tonry, 1995, 2011). In 1980, prior to the latest War on Drugs, the drug arrest rate for African-Americans was 554 per 100,000 and the rate for whites was 190 per 100,000\u2014a ratio of roughly 3 to 1. Less than 10\u2009years later, at the height of the drug war, these rates had climbed to 2,009 and 363 per 100,000 for blacks and whites, respectively (Human Rights Watch, 2009)\u2014a ratio of 5.5 to 1.\u201d This mass incarceration from the war on drugs also pushed the stereotype of black people as criminals and drug dealers. Which led to more police stereotyping and more unlawful searches and stops of African Americans. Mitchell states, \u201cSuch stereotypes appear to be particularly strong when it comes to drug offending. One study found when respondents were asked to close their eyes and envision a drug user more than 95% of respondents described a black person, and when the same respondents also perceived those involved in drug sales as typically being black (Burston, Jones, & Roberson-Saunders, 1995).\u201d While some of these harsh drug sentences have been lessened, many are still in place today.   \nIn Collins article \u201cThe Matrix of Domination\u201d she talks about oppression and how it impacts certain races and genders. Collins talks about how society judges people based on certain variables such as age, race, and gender. For example how minorities are discriminated against because of their race, how women are often oppressed by men, and how older people are often discriminated against because of their age. She talks about intersectionality and how people face oppression from multiple things, rather than just one particular thing. For example how Collins as an African American can face oppression from society because of her race. While also as a woman she has to face oppression from society because of her gender. She explains that in order to truly understand how someone is being oppressed you must consider all of the different things that play a part in the oppression.   \nCollins' ideas can be seen in relation to the racial disparity in the prison system. We can see that in prison people can be discriminated against for multiple variables. How African Americans and other minorities are discriminated against in the courtroom and are more likely to receive a harsher and longer sentence than white people. Also how African Americans and other minorities can be discriminated against when trying to receive parole or probation because the judge is less likely to grant parole or probation to minorities than white people. Another example would be how black people and other minorities are discriminated against and are more likely to be stopped or pulled over by the police than a white person. Also how black people are discriminated against and are looked at as criminals and violent and dangerous people.\n Many recent events of racial discrimination against African Americans and other minorities have reminded us that racism hasn\u2019t gone away. This can be clearly seen in the court and prison system. The statistics show the racial disparities that exist in the prison system. That African Americans are a minority in the United States, but are a majority in the worlds largest prison system. The mass incarceration of African Americans is from many factors. The minor drug charges that were changed to have harsh and long sentences because of the war on drugs. Also that black people and other minorities are more likely to get a prison sentence than white people and that black people and other minorities are more likely to get a longer sentence for the same crime than white people. This mass incarceration of African Americans also comes from the police system and how they tend to treat different races. How black people and other minorities are more likely to be stopped and questioned or pulled over by the police than white people. As well as the negative stereotype that black people are given. The stereotype that all black people are dangerous criminals that sell drugs. All of these factors show how African Americans and other minorities are racially discriminated against in this country. The racial discrimination and racial inequality that minorities face in the United States should make people push for a serious change in this country. Hopefully with the reform of our justice and police system the number of black people that are incarcerated will start to decrease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nPrison population counts.

        "text": "Sociology \n29 November 2021\nConnecting Harari to Past Sociologist\nHarari connection to Goffman\u2019s Presentation of Self\nSelf is an interesting concept which has been discussed in this course through many different perspectives. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari discusses many topics that connect to sociology. The concept that connects to previous readings we did in class was the concept about self. Harari discusses that homosapians are story tellers and like to see life through a story. \u201cWe hope to find meaning by fitting ourselves into some ready-made story about the universe\u201d (p. 302) He continues to say, \u201cThere is a storyteller in my mind that explains who I am, where I come from, where I am heading and what is happening to me right now\u201d (p. 305) This can relate to Erving Goffman\u2019s concept, The Presentation of Self. \u201cThese attributes of the individual qua performer are not merely a depicted effect of particular performances; they are psychobiological in nature, and yet they seem out of the intimate interaction with the contingency of staging performances.\u201d (Goffman, p. 256)\nErving Goffman, The Presentation of Self, believes that we are actors in our own life. Our life is a stage and we are performers. However, our performances depend on the people involved. The people in our shows create what the social situation is and how we connect to the world. This can change by the way the other people are acting.  \u201cAs performers, we are merchants of mortalities. Our day is given over to intimate contact with the goods we display and our minds are filled with intimate understandings of them\u201d (Goffman, p. 255-256) As you can see Goffman sees the concept of self as performers.  He uses the concept that life is a stage and people are acting in the play.  The stage depends on the people, place and what is happening. This creates how people act. Sometimes, other actors create our responses and dictate the play while other times we do the controlling of the show.  \nAlthough these concepts are not exactly the same, they compliment each other.  Harari believes that , \u201cin order to understand ourselves, a crucial step is to acknowledge that the \u201cself\u201d is a fictional story that the intricate mechanisms of our mind constantly manufacture, update and rewrite\u201d (Harari, p. 305). Both believe that people\u2019s lives tell a story but the story is created by how people see themselves or respond to others.  When someone is telling a memory, s/he is telling how they perceived the situation.  Harari says that the story does not need to be complete but it must have two parts to the story. The story \u201cmust give me some role to play\u201d (Harari, p. 280). \u201cThe story must provide me with an identity and give meaning to my life by embedding me within something bigger than myself\u201d (Harari, p. 280). One can connect that Harari is an actor or performer in a story and this is how he perceives his life. Goffman also perceives \u201cself\u201d as an actor in one's story of life. Therefore one can see the connection between Harari and Goffman.  \nHarari\u2019s beliefs compared to Durkeim\nIn class we have also spent time learning about society and how society connects people. We have studied sociologist Emile Durheim who explained how society defines morals and although these morals are defined, people are individuals who live within the morals. People have free will and make decisions on their own.  Durkeim also believed that religion provided a meaning for life and collective representation is a form of religion that connects people.  Harari discusses the fact that our democracy thinks there is free will and the customer is always right.  However, with artificial intelligence (AI) and humans creating and using technology, data provided by AI is enhancing the decisions people are making and molding their minds.  Harari also talks about religion and god.  Although both philosophers discuss these concepts, their beliefs are different and show different ideas.  This may be due to the differences in time but nonetheless the concepts show different aspects of humans connecting to the meaning of life. \nDurkeim talks about \u201ccollective conscious\u201d which is a \u201cset of set of shared beliefs, ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within\nsociety\u201d(The evolutionary origins of the collective consciousness powerpoint, slide 3). This concept is used to create morals in our society.  Individuality is a good thing and people want to be themselves while living in this society. As a result, you are responsible for yourself and your choices.  In our culture this is important and created from collective consciousness.  Religion is also a part of collective consciousness and has brought people together.  Collective representation is how collective consciousness is evident.  Collective representation is when something symbolizes or represents a concept.  An example would be the Christmas tree at Christmas time.  People know that the tree represents the holiday celebration.  Everyone may not know the reasons but they do understand the representation. The collective belief of the Christmas tree is to celebrate the holiday. Some other ways collective representation is evident is through the beliefs and morals of the religion.  For example, women are supposed to dress a certain way and men and women are supposed to be a couple.  This concept is one that Harari does not agree with.  First I will explain Harari\u2019s beliefs and then compare them to each other.  \nHarari talks about our world changing from a free world to a world controlled by data through AI. He brings up a concerning concept which changes what Durkheim believed about society. In today's world there is computer technology and information that is spread through AI. Harari is concerned that AI will begin to control society and create collective consciousness through the computer. The beliefs may not be shared but seen so much that the person looking over the information starts to believe in what they are seeing or reading. For example, if one is looking at their phone on instagram and watching surf videos, instagram as well as google will start to show advertisements that connect to surfing. It could be a trip to a surfing area, a surfboard or wetsuit advertisement, etc. This may not be something the person is looking for but will connect from the AI data on the phone and unconsciously decide they need the item. This is not a connecting force within society but could come to that if the power of these companies becomes too big. The question here would be do we truly live in a free world? Is our world starting to be taken over by the AI with all of the computer technology that is being implemented?  \nHarari like Durkheim believes that religion has collective representations but those representations should not always be placed as part of the religion and what God wants or what is morally right. Harari explains that maybe the 3rd commandment which states not to use God's name in vain means that people should not use God \u201cto justify our political interests, our economic ambitions or our personal hatred\u201d (Harari, p. 202). Many times people say God says what is right or wrong.  Harari believes that human suffering should be the reason for morality and should be how people decide what is right or wrong.  \nDurkheim and Harari believe that our present culture is one that promotes the customer's always right attitude but Harari is concerned with this concept changing and big companies who control the data and algorithms controlling people\u2019s thoughts.  This is something one needs to look out for. The corporations need to think about the meaning of life when creating AI. \nAlthough Durkheim and Harari believe in religion, Durkheim believes that religion gives a meaning of life.  Harari believes that people do not need religion to act morally or have a meaning to life. People are moral beings and need to understand human suffering when making decisions in life. Harari believes that the spiritual quest brings people the meaning of life. Meditation and looking for answers provide life\u2019s meaning.  \nHarari has many connections with past sociologists.  His book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, has some connections to the past but also connects some concerns for the future as the world relies more on technology. Like Goffman, people are actors in their own play while our collective consciousness ties us together when we should look more into our own thoughts and how what one does supports the success of society and reduces suffering. One needs to understand that the story of life is being made and people are learning as they continue through their journey.  \n\n\n\nWork Cited\n\n\n\nGoffman, Erving.

        "text": "The Alienation of the Blue-Collar Worker\n\tIn modern society, an individual is defined by their career. Careers determine if one is educated, successful, or just another machine in society. The crossing of alienation and social class reflects society and its perception of an individual. In modern society, individuals look down upon people who work blue-collar jobs and idolize those who are millionaires with their own businesses. The correlation between social class and alienation reflects the imbalance of power and opportunities that shape individuals\u2019 experiences and identities.\n\tSocial class divides society into economic groups, resulting in resource discrepancies and shaping overall life experiences. In the historical and modern world, labor workers experience a different lifestyle to those of wealth and status. Labor workers have worked endless hours to make ends meet, make insufficient salaries, and work in harsh conditions yet receive no recognition. Those of wealth, however, receive all recognition of the work of the labor workers. Praised by all in society, the wealthy class receives all the economic benefits that result in access to education, the ability to move up the socioeconomic ladder, and guarantee a successful lifestyle for their children. \n\tA prime example of the discrepancies in lifestyles in today's society is the family of a trade worker and the family of a businessman. Social media has allowed society to view different lifestyles, especially TikTok. TikTok has allowed individuals to post their day to day lives, allowing viewers to get the reality of their life. In a day to day of trade worker, the day begins at seven am and ends at five pm. In between their days, trade workers are expected to work in the blazing heat and meet job expectations with little to no help outside of their work crew. Alongside many trade workers work under 1099. They are expected to buy the tools and necessities to complete the job but receive no benefits from their jobs. Trade workers are required to search for and pay for healthcare on their own and at times for their families as well resulting in the need to work countless hours. Whereas the life of a businessman sounds bliss compared to the life of a trade worker.  They can work a nine-to-five job, have access to healthcare, and receive an abundance of benefits. This is later reflected in the interactions they have with their own families. \n\tAs trade workers work countless hours to make ends meet for their families, their jobs become their identifying factors. There are no longer any separating factors between who the trade worker is as a person and his job. Children begin to view their parents as concrete workers rather than fathers or mothers. Trade workers start to invest in their careers in hopes of economic prosperity resulting in the lack of quality family time. Business owners, however, have the luxury to separate themselves from their jobs. They can practice hobbies, cut time out of their day to spend time with their family, and invest in their family rather than their careers. Business owners do not have the need to alienate themselves for their jobs and have it be a describing factor to who they are as a person. They now instead can focus on obtaining resources that guarantee long-lasting economic success for their children whether it's an investment in their education or hobbies. They have the privilege of becoming known as the family man rather than the working man. However, this success of identification is only granted through the imbalance of power between the two. \n\tThe trade worker does not have the luxury of working on their own time and merit compared to the businessman. In the capitalist world, there must always be a worker generating revenue for the \u2018boss\u2019. The \u2018boss\u2019 will take the revenue generated and distribute a portion of it to pay their workers. Though the \u2018boss\u2019 did not partake in any of the labor, they gained all the means and the labor workers must now rely on the generosity of their boss. The trade worker no longer works for themselves, creating work that they are passionate about, but instead, work to create products for the \u2018boss\u2019 further alienating themselves. Thus, resulting in greater power and economic imbalance between the two classes. \n\tThe relationship between alienation and social class reveals the complex ties between the imbalance of power and opportunities that lead to the individuals' identity. Through the difference in lifestyles, the identities of trade workers are vastly different from the businessman. With the businessman having access to an abundance of resources that guarantee economic prosperity, allowing them to find identifying factors outside of their career. Whereas the trade worker does not have economic security, forcing them to revolve their lives around their job. The difference in economic security further perpetuates the power imbalance between the two. As one has more economic freedom than the other, allows the businessman to work for themselves in comparison to the trade worker working for the businessman. Recognizing the imbalance of power and opportunities allows the potential to demand change and move toward an equal society, in which one does not have to alienate themselves for their career, and social class does not determine the long-lasting success of an individual.

        "text": "Devon Lemasters\nSOC-105\nFebruary 12, 2021\nGender Concepts\n\tWhether you are male, female, transgender, or a mixture of all three, you have experienced, and will continue to experience, the concept of gender as it pertains to the Western collective consciousness. Gender roles affect us all, and while they might not be as stark and suffocating as a few decades ago, they are certainly still there. Whoever you are and whatever you chose to identify as, you are subjected to attitudes and subconscious decisions that will determine how you feel about your own femininity or masculinity. Therefore, your gender expression determines what behavior is appropriate, and even if you decide to go against the grain, you are still doing so because you are conscious that it is an invisible barrier that you must overcome. \n\tGilman\u2019s \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d takes a stance on the role of women within a marriage, and how women are relegated to this simple caregiver. In this instance, as all control is taken away from her, she is forced to make up a fantasy in which she has some semblance of control over her life. The stereotype of women being the caregivers and stay-at-home mothers was not perpetuated by women but born out of necessity. As men entered the work force and the capitalistic 9-5 work week became the norm, women were relegated to the home. Men decided to be the breadwinners, and women had to become the other. Even today, as women are an important part of the work force, the wage gap reinforces that even though women have proven time and time again that they are as intelligent and hardworking as men, they are still seen as less in the eyes of their employers and the work force as a whole. \n\tThe female experience is one that involves fighting against a norm and being hailed as a \u2018trend setter\u2019 or \u2018trail blazer,\u2019 going along with a norm for a comfortable life in which you at the very least have control of a household, or somehow blending together the two. Each is as inherently female as the other and should be respected as a decision that is ours alone to make. With the modern feminist movement reaching a peak, women are fighting for the chance to be seen as anything other than \u201cother.\u201d The road is long but is paved by each and every person who decides they are a woman and refuse to be seen as anything other than.

        "text": "Omi and Winant start out their argument with the discovery of the new world and Native Americans. The discovery of a type of people who were different from what Europeans were used to normally encountering, made them challenge their beliefs of creation and what man looked like. This meant there had to be a distinction for white Europeans between themselves, and the \u201cother\u201d that had been so unfamiliar to them. Fast forwarding through time to the period after Reconstruction and the development of the different expectations of what it meant to be \u201cblack,\u201d or \u201clatino,\u201d or even \u201cwhite\u201d were created at this time. What this brought with it was a certain level of expectations for how people of a certain race would act in scenarios and what their standing in society and economy was expected to be. The formation of racial stereotypes is a direct application of Erving Goffman\u2019s \u201cPresentation of Self\u201d in a way. This is seen in that where each actor comes to the stage with expectations for how the other actors will perform their roles. This is applied in that how media and past experiences can form stereotypes for people about other races, such as that of white people being expected to hold higher socio-economic positions to that of black or latino people, forcing preconceived notions onto minorities trying to get out of their current socio-economic positions as people who they really aren\u2019t and when do not act in the way they are expected to, can lead to confusion, or suspicion of them for no reason.",

        "text": "29 November 2021\nIn the media, we are exposed to jaw dropping, terrifying news that is hard for an adult, but also teenagers and children to watch. We have all been drug into endless talk about the market, the biggest busts about religion, and we have heard it all, how do we know what is right? Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century covers several topics including working, artificial intelligence, social justice, community, several belief systems, war, terrorism, nationalism, education, and several other topics. While heading straight on to several controversial and confusing ideas, some sociologists may agree with things he said, or some may have come to different conclusions. A couple of these a sharing of opinion when it comes to capitalism and now this country is being run with workers and employees and include differencing in opinion over religion. In this paper I will be analyzing how Harari believed capitalism affected the workers along with Weber and Marx, as well as how religion impacted society versus Durkheim, Maryanski, and Turner. \n\tOne of the things that Harari wrote about was the idea of capitalism. Harari believed that the economy and how jobs were run in the first place was something that would be drastically changing in the years to come. Machines would take over jobs, new jobs would be created, but the economy and working class would not be able to keep up. Harari believed that the system was just too complex for one man to understand. In the end, artificial intelligence would be able to take over any job and there may be a worthless class of people who are not educated for the next job above. Harari states, \u201cNevertheless, in the long run no job will remain absolutely safe from automation (26).\u201d From programs made to detect human emotions, to software that can increase knowledge to each individual AI worker, the need for the limited human mind will decrease. When it comes to the current working class, Harari believes that this system is destroying its workers by basically chewing them up and spitting them back out once they are done working. We have made a piece of paper have a respected value, become enslaved to it, and are constantly putting ourselves to work just to survive. This means that corporations are being selfish and money greedy. Corporations build their structure based on their own religion and/or morals. This could actually be hurting employees that do not exactly agree with this. For example, for holidays, what days are breaks and when do people still need to come in even if it is another employee\u2019s holiday. This also can hurt someone\u2019s self esteem by enforcing rules of how they dress, look, act, or perform in general. Not only this, but it trains the employee\u2019s brain to figure out what is best for the buyer before themselves. The corporation will not only use its employees, but also cookies and data on other websites to see how to attract more people to buy their products. Harari believe data is knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is expensive \u2013 but worth the pretty penny. Corporations are able to create ads targeted at a specific group of people who they know will see it and invest in their product. This idea of taking advantage of the knowledge of the public, it\u2019s utter hardships on employees, and possibility of being overturned by artificial intelligence, is why Harari does not approve or favor the capitalist society that runs our country. \n\tSeveral other sociologists are also perplexed over the idea of capitalism and the burden it creates for its employees. Max Weber, in the Spirit of Capitalism, found the idea peculiar because while many people find joy in being able to work toward a common goal, accomplish things, and receive reward for the work they put in, people are still giving up much of their time and happiness for it. In fact, Weber believes that people give up the chance of spontaneity, freedom, and become a completely different person in their work field. The worker\u2019s \u201coutside life\u201d is considered a separate life, and one that becomes something a worker would look forward to because of their job being so terrible. Karl Marx was also someone who empathized with the workers who were put under the capitalist economy. He called it \u201cEstranged Labor\u201d. He believed that people who worked under capitalism was basically turned into an animal and used for profit. Because of the need for money to survive, Marx says that people are coerced into labor, not for the satisfaction of completing or accomplishing anything, but just to make ends meet for themselves and/or their families. The worker becomes solely focused on survival instead of life and having fun, being spontaneous, or just enjoying the moment. Marx believed that capitalism does not help the workers, just the large CEOs of corporations, and the person becomes the tool to the end product, destroying the idea of the purpose of humans. While he admits humans are easily adaptable to life threatening situations, he believes that the market lowers us to the value of an animal. The labor becomes objectified because the value comes from your product and what you are able to produce. Why do people get raises or fired? \u2013 their outcomes at work.\nMarx also talks about how there are 4 dimensions of alienation. People can be alienated from the process of labor, from the product, from other workers, or just from yourself. He believes that working in this environment makes it hard to avoid these types of alienation. From the process and product was how much you are valued because of your work, from other workers due to the fact that no one shares the same fate, and last from yourself and how you value and make your work meaningful to you, even if that is challenging in a workplace you do not enjoy. Harari, Weber, and Marx all at least were skeptical of the process of capitalism, but all can see that it does not put a worker first and can harm them individually when putting them into the work force. Harari was the one to think further ahead to see that even as employees are not being treated correctly now, it may get worse as we progressively move forward with artificial intelligence.\n\tEven with some in agreement, some of the things Harari argued have not been completely agreed upon among other sociologists. One of these differences was the impact that religion had on a group of people, a society, a definition of a way of life. Harari did admit to being a religious person himself, but he was objective toward how it may have affected society. Harari believed it brought false teaching, fake news, and different ideas of how history came about. He believed that religion was basically a guideline for society and a way to live. It helped to cope with questions that they couldn\u2019t answer, but many didn\u2019t ever know if this \u201cGod\u201d was a creator or a lawmaker. Societies will use the story of divine mystery to legitimatize social order, even when no one really has all the answers. Secularism can even be an issue according to Harari because he believes that it is not prepared for the issues of the 21st century. Because of our corrupt justice system, it is hard to enforce that every person has intrinsic value.\nAlong with the struggle for people to be treated of equal value, he learned that those with different religious backgrounds will have different teachings about history. Not even just as a timeline of when the earth and universe was created, but also with who had great discoveries, inventions, or began different things. For example, Harari used the example of yoga, while known to be a Buddhist tradition, some believe that someone from the Bible actually created it as a gift to a society. Lastly, Harari also believes that we are in a post-truth era. Although he says it has been that way from the Stone Age, he believes that this has allowed for fake news, births of other false religions and teaching, and false power obsessions. He believes that this allows for a concept called group think which can limit a person's individuality and lead them to be loyal to a cause blindly, without doing their own research. He believes that a society has actually gotten dumber due to the fact that the collective consciousness has gotten smarter, but individually we are weaker. We know someone who can fix or make something that we cannot do. Not only this, but many of us will accept the \u201ctruth\u201d that we can see on television or on the internet because of our lack of knowledge and research ourselves. We trust that those who are supposed to do their jobs correctly, will do them. As stated earlier, however, it is apparent that corporations will do what they must to bring in the most amount of money. This can set a perfect pathway for false advertising, teaching, and news. Many people in power, who have the money to bend or cut the truth from the public, will do what they need to stay in good standing to make money. Harari states that people in power that do this is what makes up politics, but if it happens over hundreds or thousands of years, it becomes a religion. These point Harari states makes religion out to be where there may be less good and more corrupt and messiness. \n\tHowever, in past units, there would be other sociologists that would disagree with Harari. Maryanski and Turner studied that adaptation of early Morotopithecus, a type of ape that was able to thrive over other types of apes. They found that emotions were important for the expansion of cognition in early species, and with that came religion. Their memory was enhanced, they were able to make more rational decisions, and they gave things meaning and connections. Without that, they would not have been able to survive and thrive as well, according to Maryanski and Turner. Durkheim also believed that religion was actually important to study and it made strong societies. He believed that all the great social institutions are born in religion. A religion was able to impact the collective consciousness of the society with making symbols, artifacts, a narrative, a day, or really anything has meaning and value to a society. With this said, religion was believed to be crucially important to societies.\n\tHarari believed that the economy and capitalism could crush an individual self, and religion would question an individual self. Which was right, what was wrong, and if you are completing life as you are supposed to. While Harari believed having questions you could not answer was better than answers you could not question, it gives hard direction for someone completing life. Several sociologists agreed with Harari and his findings with a couple also disagreeing. However, there could be a third perspective that something could have been good back then, but without change, it does not work for society now. This is a point that Harari was making. Societies are constantly changing, growing, and upgrading. If traditions do not change and reform, then our society may crumble by unknowns, artificial intelligence, and violence. Both capitalism and religion will make an individual question their self-worth, just depends \u2013 where do you see yourself belonging?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\nHarari, Y.

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n2 April 2021\nThe Effects of Artificial Intelligence on the Consciousness of Self\n\tIn modern society, the advancements of artificial intelligence are developing at an exponential rate. Micheal Haenlein and Andreas Kaplan define artificial intelligence as \u201ca system\u2019s ability to interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation\u201d. As this artificial intelligent technology evolves, children are growing up in a world where it is not uncommon to rely on computers for everyday needs. Because of this, people are becoming more reliant than ever on machines. The reliance on AI is a newly found concept that continues to grow, becoming more powerful than we can imagine. With a world becoming so dependent on highly intelligent technology systems, one could consider what the outcome would be if this technology were to disappear. One could also consider what the outcome would be if technology were to completely take over. What would happen to humanity's ability to function? \n\tAs time goes on, and the electronic world flourishes, an individual's ability to be self-aware is being quickly depreciated. The consciousness of self is the idea that one is not only aware of their surroundings, but they are aware of how they feel, how they are perceived, and who they are in general. The consciousness of self can be interpreted in many different ways from many different theorists. It is important for one to be connected to their consciousness of self because it helps to express one's individuality. With artificial intelligence developing to the vast size that it is today, great change is happening without humanity even knowing. Artificial intelligence has negative effects on one\u2019s perception of self because it limits one's ability to have original ideas, puts individuals at risk of job loss, makes one blindly reliant, causes one to be unaware of their surroundings, and decreases the amount of social interaction in general. \n\tIndividuality is one aspect that is heavily affected by the growth of artificial intelligence. One can argue that today, there is less original thought being provoked because everybody is fed the same information. Being fed the same information makes it extremely difficult for people to form their own ideas and opinions simply because they are given the right answer with no additional thought. As the world is being rewritten by AI, the human race adapts, because that is our nature. In Our Identities in The Age of Artificial Intelligence, Jun Wu states \u201cThese impacts will prompt us to adapt. In the process, our identities will shift. For example, workers who thrived performing repetitive tasks will see their jobs being replaced by AI systems. In those instances, the workers\u2019 identities and how they perceive themselves will need to shift with their changing environment\u2026 we will need to naturally shift our own social identities to adapt to this new world.\u201d (Wu 3)  This shows that people will adapt to whatever the circumstances may be. In this case, individuals will adapt to a society with no original thought. With no individuality, it would not only directly affect the way a society would function, but would essentially strip people of their identities and everyone will be the same.\nWith the advancements of artificial intelligence, social interaction is put at high risk. If society fully replaced human to human interaction, with human to artificial intelligence interaction, society would lack real, personal connections. In Can Social Interaction Constitute Social Cognition, Hanne De Jaegher, Ezequiel Di Paolo, and Shaun Gallagher states \u201cA definition of social interaction should capture these intuitions concerning the engagement of at least two agents in a complex co-regulated pattern. Engagement can correspond to fluctuating feelings of connectedness with the other \u2013 whose meaning sometimes seems transparent and sometimes opaque \u2013 and of increasing and decreasing possibilities for participation. This experience sometimes turns into that of being taken up in the flow of the interaction\u201d (Jaegher et al. 442) This shows that an interaction should provide a sense of connectedness. By connecting and building strong ties with family, friends and the community, people tend to feel a sense of security, support, and purpose. George Herbert Mead believed that the conceptualization of ourselves can be broken into two parts: the \u201cme\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cme\u201d regulates our behavior based on how we think that others perceive us, while the \u201cI\u201d is the reaction caused from the attitude of a community. Mead believes the conceptualization of ourselves are defined through the interactions encountered in the social realm. Adolescence is an important time to build social skills and form identity, but with the substitution of AI interaction for real-life interaction, teens will experience major impacts on their social and emotional development. \nHuman interaction is extremely important for one to understand and perceive their own self. Erving Goffman discovered that the self is collectively produced in the Presentation of Self. He proves that human interaction is so complex that roles are created within a society to provide purpose. Presentation of Self elaborated on the idea of roles in a set society by directly dividing an individual into two parts: the performer and the character. \u201c...the very structure of the self can be seen in terms of how we arrange for such performances in our Anglo-American society\u201d (Goffman 256). This entails that the social world is made up through an abundance of performances by an enormous amount of actors, in a variation of settings. Erving Goffman proposes that we find our identities through the process of performing and observing the way we execute the performance. In \u201cHow AI will rewire us\u201d, Nicholas A. Christakis states \u201cBut adding artificial intelligence to our midst could be much more disruptive. Especially as machines are made to look and act like us and to insinuate themselves deeply into our lives, they may change how loving or friendly or kind we are\u2014not just in our direct interactions with the machines in question, but in our interactions with one another.\u201d (Christakis 1) This directly shows the potential threat that artificial intelligence brings upon a community. Adding AI to a social environment can only cause humans to behave differently, whether it be shown through daily social skills or something as simple as productivity. \nThe current technological improvements regarding AI, have created a widespread fear of job loss.  After looking at whose specific job is at risk it is important to consider the numbers, how many jobs are being taken? Arto Baltayan, technology writer and technical documentations specialist stated in his article, \u201cRobots, Automation and Technology Taking Over-- Is Your Job At Risk?\u201d, \u201cBetween 2000 and 2010, the United States lost over five-and-a-half million jobs in the manufacturing sector,\u201d (Baltayan 1) This shows that the amount of jobs being lost in the United States is extremely high, on top of that, all this evidence is only talking about one sector. Moreover, artificial intelligence technology is not just affecting employees in manufacturing, but has a significant effect on all jobs. William M. Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University stated \u201cYet most analysis tends to be prospective in nature, and estimates of future impacts on employment vary widely, with some studies predicting that as many as 50 percent of all workers are at risk of losing their jobs to automation.\u201d (Rodgers 1) This shows that the integration of artificial intelligence does not only impact the manufacturing sector, but has a broader effect on all aspects of the workforce contributing to the predicted 50 percent of all workers losing their jobs to artificial intelligence technology. Without a given purpose, an individual faces the threat of a perception and identity crisis. If artificial intelligence learns how to possess a higher consciousness to function with human behaviors and habits, the people will be forced to learn how to adapt to a new technological world. \nHuman beings are conscious not only of the world around them but also of themselves: their activities, their bodies, and their mental lives. Changes to consciousness can result in changes in perception, thinking, understanding, and interpretations of the world. In \u201cSociety, consciousness and change\u2014An inquiry into Pentti Malaska's futures thinking\u201d, Markku Malaska states \u201cThe dynamics of development, where extensive and intensive stages alternate at the same time as regenerative growth forces development into a specific direction.\u201d (Malaska 61) This can be applied to the effects of artificial intelligence because these technological advancements are a major change that will bring upon an inevitable outcome. Adding artificial intelligence to a social environment, will eventually lead to a change in the way society performs. This initially starts with a single individual and their cognition processes being altered by the outside factor. One may ask, if the addition of AI will only bring upon questionable change, why do it? In The impact of artificial intelligence on human society and bioethics, Michael Cheng-Tek Tai states \u201cHistory tells us that human is always looking for something faster, easier, more effective, and convenient to finish the task they work on; therefore, the pressure for further development motivates humankind to look for a new and better way of doing things.\u201d (Tai 1) This is able to explain the motives behind developing a human society. As the human race has the ability to raise their consciousness higher, they tend to strive for more, without consideration of the possible consequences.  \nOverall, it can be shown that artificial intelligence can have negative effects on one\u2019s perception of self due to a multitude of reasons. One being the limitations placed on one\u2019s ability to create their own ideas and opinions. Without the influence of others original thoughts and ideas, there would be no free expression and individuality. Individuality is very important when it comes to the consciousness of one\u2019s self. This is because one feels a sense of reassurance in knowing that they have an idea of who they are, or what their identity consists of. A major contributing factor to one\u2019s sense of purpose, that should not go unmentioned, would be the type of job or position that one hold\u2019s. When an individual lacks a sense of purpose, they become susceptible to a loss of self-awareness. Artificial intelligence is not able to raise it\u2019s consciousness like humans, but once it is able to expand its potential, many will fear for their jobs. This will essentially lead to a dependence on artificial intelligence. With a society reliant on AI, many traits of independence and self-sufficiency will deteriorate. The consciousness of self is heavily affected by the surrounding community. One may even say, the consciousness of self can develop solely from the environmental factors one is exposed to. With a heavy reliance on artificial intelligence, social interaction will eventually lose the personal connection and meaning. We find our identities through the process of performing and observing the way we execute our performance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nWu, J. (2019, July 12).

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n2 April 2021\nResults of the Collective Consciousness\nReligion is a very complex concept and is interpreted differently by all people within the collective consciousness. Many could even consider religion to be an effect of the collective consciousness. In \u201cMicrofoundations\u201d, Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdams can be closely analyzed and compared to Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, to show how humans have evolved consciously, leading to further exploration of religion, bringing upon new questions that examine the intentions and purpose.\nMcAdams and Fligstein propose the theory that humans can raise their consciousness to further grasp and understand the meaning of human existence. Religion, in many cases, tries to define a purpose in an individual\u2019s life. This can be seen as a result of the collective consciousness because religion was formed throughout society as a way to explain a higher consciousness. People tend to gravitate towards order and direction because of their nature. Harari is able to explain the causes of this human nature by stating that people look for this so-called order through institutions such as religion.\nAll in all, religion is a result of the collective consciousness because of people\u2019s need to justify and explain daily issues. Moreover, religion is used to help humans cope and understand things that cannot be explained by math or science. The existence of religion influences modern day society as a whole by providing answers to many unanswerable questions.",

        "text": "Devon Lemasters\nSOC-105\nApril 28, 2021\nRacial Bias in the Criminal Justice System in America\nThe rate of imprisonment in the United States has seen a five times increase since 1972 and 40% of those prisoners are Black. This may come as a surprise since Black Americans make up only 13% of the population, but there is evidence to suggest that those numbers are engineered by a corrupt Criminal Justice system. For every 100,000 Black Americans, 2,306 of them are incarcerated. Compare that to white Americans, where for every 100,000 there are 450 incarcerated individuals, and you begin to see a trend (Sakala 2014). In light of recent events in the news, like the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, more people than ever are talking about police brutality and the Criminal Justice system. The racism goes farther than police brutality, however, and it infects even the deepest roots of our prison system. The American Criminal Justice System does not just passively perpetuate systematic racism in the United States through the personal prejudices of a few police officers, but rather it is founded and based upon discrimination as an inherent mechanism by which it operates. The War on Drugs, mass incarceration, police brutality, and wrongful convictions are all integral to the oppression seen by this system. \n\tWhite Privilege by Peggy McIntosh outlines several things, 26 to be exact, that are daily occurrences of White Privilege that white people rarely think about being a privilege. White people have the privilege of not having their communities ravaged during the War on Drugs. White people have the privilege of simply existing around police officers without fearing for their safety because of the color of their skin. White people have the privilege of not losing their mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters all to a prison system that incarcerates them at a higher rate than people of different skin color. White people have the privilege of having a fair and just trial, where they do not know in the back of their minds that people of their skin color are being wrongfully put to death and imprisoned at a higher rate than any other skin color. These things are all happening behind the scenes, but are very purposeful in their effect on Black communities. \n\t\u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did\u201d (Baum 2016). This quote said by John Ehrlichman, who was the Assistant to Domestic Affairs of President Richard Nixon, shows how deep racism runs in the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs was not the first or only instance of Black people being wrongly blamed for an ongoing drug problem in the United States (Lusane, and Desmond 1991). In the late 1880s, cocaine was being included in everything from medicine to soft drinks and cigarettes. By 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed which required any product manufacturer to tell consumers that their products contained addictive drugs or substances. A few years later in 1909, Dr. Hamilton Wright would be chosen by President Theodore Roosevelt to lead a campaign to stop the opium trade in Asia. In 1910, he would release the Report on the International Opium Commission, which proved to employ racist imagery and scapegoating to appeal to the racism of white Americans. The report would include lies about Black people, even going as far as to propose that cocaine use made them bulletproof, gave them unimaginable strength, and, worst of all, encouraged them to rape women. This was a blatant lie, as no evidence at the time suggested that Black men used cocaine at a higher rate than any other demographic. These lies had disastrous effects, resulting in the \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919 where almost seventy lynchings were recorded (Lusane, and Desmond 1991).\n Over the next decade, many more decisions would be made to undermine Black communities in America. The Mafia, with their ever-growing power in the 1950s, decided to sell hard drugs almost exclusively to Black Americans. This decision created a Heroin addiction epidemic of intense proportions which disproportionally affected Black communities. Over many years of struggling with addiction, Black communities would turn to drug dealing and gangs to at least make some money off of their growing drug problem. The government\u2019s solution to this problem was vastly more destructive than helpful. Instead of understanding the root of the drug problem in Black neighborhoods, the solution was to build prisons and fill them with said Black neighborhoods (Lusane, and Desmond 1991).  This leads to the next mechanism used by the criminal justice system to undermine Black communities in the United States: mass incarceration. \nAccording to a report released by The Sentencing Project in 1994, one in three Black American men ages 20-29 is under the control of the criminal justice system, meaning in prison, on parole, or on probation (Mauer, and Huling 1995). As stated previously, Black Americans make up 40% of the prison population while only making up 13% of the American population. The logical conclusion is not that Black Americans do more crime, but rather that the laws are affecting them disproportionately. The cities that regularly house the poorest and most vulnerable citizens are also the most paroled, and as a result, produce more incarcerations. The judgment cannot necessarily be made that these neighborhoods have more crime happening in them, just that preconceived notions influence increased rates of police intervention (Fagan et al. 2003). As much of the effect incarceration has on the actual individuals being incarcerated, it is also worth noting that families of these individuals may bear more of the hardships of their families being ripped apart from the inside out. When you take into account fathers and mothers leaving children to grandparents, children going into the foster system, and children turning to sell drugs as a way to survive, the cycle continues exponentially (Braman 2003). It was previously determined that drug laws disproportionately affect Black Americans, and these drug laws are working to strip defendants of their rights to a fair trial. The judicial system works to \u2018overcharge\u2019 defendants to effectively scare them into waiving their rights to trial by pleading guilty. This causes the majority, more than 90% in some cases, of drug-related cases being ended by guilty pleas rather than a trial (Roberts 2008).\n \tMass incarceration leads to a disproportionately high number of Black felons. Felons are stripped of their rights to vote or bear arms. Felons also may not be able to travel freely, are barred from employment in some fields, and may lose parental rights to any children they may have and may not participate in many forms of public aid like food stamps and public housing (\"What Rights Do Convicted Felons Lose?\"). In modern prison systems, all felons are stripped of these rights, but it wasn\u2019t always this way. In the late 1860s, some Southern states passed laws to punish crimes by removing their rights to vote, but they were assigned to crimes like burglary, thievery, adultery, and those convicted of domestic violence, all of which were mainly committed by Black people. Those convicted of murder, however, were not stripped of their right to vote. It can only be assumed that is because more white people were convicted of murder than Black people (Roberts 2008).\nThere is yet another angle to view this from, however, if we consider that Black Americans are being incarcerated and prosecuted at a higher rate than white Americans, we can also infer that there is a higher percentage of Black Americans being wrongfully accused as well. As of October 2016, Black Americans make up 47% of exonerations listed in the National Registry of Exonerations (Gross et al. 2017). This is not even taking into account the 1,800 people who were framed for crimes as a part of several large scandals, later set straight with \u201cgroup exonerations.\u201d Innocent Black Americans are seven times more likely to be falsely accused of murder and three-and-a-half times more likely to be falsely accused of sexual assault. They are also five times more likely to be arrested for illegal drug-related crimes, despite using drugs at the same rates as white Americans. Black people are more likely to be stopped and searched concerning drug crimes than white Americans, which is already determined to be deadly in some cases of police brutality. There have even been cases of police officers blatantly lying to incarcerate Black people for drug-related crimes. In 1999 Tom Coleman, an undercover narcotics officer, framed 39 people, most being Black, for selling cocaine. In 2003, 35 of those people were found innocent and Coleman was found guilty of perjury. The cocaine that he proposed was being sold by these people came from cocaine that he owned and bought (Gross et al. 2017).\n Police officers have long brought violence to Black communities and often serve as judge, jury, and executioner for many. The media representation of the Derek Chauvin trial has thrown police brutality into the minds of more American\u2019s than ever, but his trial is something that many Black Americans do not have the privilege to be a part of. The criminal justice system works hard to convince the American public that these are isolated events of bad people doing bad things, rather than inherent and systematic racism ingrained in the very fibers of every police uniform worn in this country. Police officers choose to protect other police officers, rather than choosing to protect and serve the people they promised they would, this is often called \u201cthe blue wall of silence\u201d (Roberts 2008).  If we cannot trust the very people who are entrusted to uphold and enforce our laws to not allow their prejudices to influence who they arrest, who can we trust? The answer is that we should have never trusted these officers in the first place because they are products of an entire system that was built to produce people with the power over life and death and to give them those prejudices.\nAfter outlining four distinct ways the criminal justice system strives to undermine and poison Black communities in America, it is obvious that the system has less of a passive role in systematic racism and more of a foundational and oppressive role. The War on Drugs, dating back to far before Nixon or Reagan\u2019s presidency, simultaneously spread horrible rumors about Black Americans and their role in the growing drug problem in the early 1990s, and later got Black communities dependent on heroin. Mass incarceration put many Black Americans back into the exploitive prison labor system, reminiscent of slavery work conditions, tore apart their families and communities, and lead to the over-policing of Black neighborhoods that we still struggle heavily with. Black Americans who were convicted of felonies also lose a lot of their rights, most devastatingly, the right to public aid that would help to support their families as well as being able to be employed in several fields. This further ruins Black communities and allows young Black people to grow up in unstable situations, completely out of their control. Wrongful convictions affect Black Americans at a higher rate than white Americans and therefore contribute in their own way to the destruction of Black communities and their ways of life. Police officers are allowed and encouraged by the criminal justice system to assume that Black people are violent and a danger to them and others. This must be recognized as a system that was built on the oppression of Black people and not just an unfortunate byproduct. As slavery was made illegal, America turned to \u201cseparate-but-equal.\u201d As that was outlawed, lawmakers and public officials found entirely new ways to ensure that Black Americans would never be equal. These have no place in modern America and the system by which they are allowed to continue happening has to be reformed or abolished before any more damage is done to Black communities in America. \nReferences\n\"What Rights Do Convicted Felons Lose?\".

        "text": "4/28/2021\nSOC 105-002\nSocial Media and the Power Elite\u2019s Influence on Politics\nAmerica has not had the traditional forms of power held for most of its existence. As when compared to Europe, there has not any singular church to rule over the country as was the case in Europe for centuries, or a very large government to hold all the power as it was with nation-states in Europe or an extremely powerful military that could threaten to overthrow the government until very recently in 1940, relatively recent in the scope of 1776 to now. As G. William Domhoff points out then, there is only one way in which power can be accumulated in America, gaining economic power. This through the years has created its own social class of power elites in America that doesn\u2019t put these people in positions as public policymakers like congressmen and women, but as corporate executives and members of the 1% that begin to decide everything through social circles that tend to involve board members of 80%-90% of all corporations in the United States. \nThese corporations while at first may have been limited to a few large media companies like big television networks like NBC and ABC and big newspapers like the LA Times and New York Times, the power elite\u2019s control over the media has grown since then. With the boom of the internet and social media over the past 20 years, the power elite has been put in a  better position to influence public policy and the general public\u2019s opinion on policy through the usage of algorithms that have been put in place on social media like on Facebook which has created polarization on both sides of political debates.\nG. William Domhoff defines in his work, \u201cPower in America,\u201d the three indicators of power as who benefits, who governs, and who wins. In these indicators, the corporate executives are able to hold positions of economic power that they financially benefit from. But also benefit from the political power they are able to hold in the usage of their funds for donations to campaigns of candidates that they either already influence or align with the beliefs of the power elite in turn putting the power elite in charge of the policymaking process allowing them to govern. As mentioned before, Domhoff points out that 15-20% of corporate directors that sit on 2 or more boards of directors that make up 80% to 90% of the largest corporations in the US into what is a very well-connected corporate community. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram consist of these very large corporations now and likely have board members that are part of the \u201cinner circle\u201d 15-20% that influence the entire corporate community. This allows the corporations and in turn, the power elite to put who they desire in office to put in policies that benefit these large corporations and 1% of society more than the majority of Americans meaning that these power elites continue to win with those they put into office.\nHow does the power elite manage to win over public opinion on policies that should seem clear to not benefit the general public that is actually in control of the election process in America? This is where the influence of social media comes into play for politics. In an article written by Taiana Bucher, she evaluates the new algorithms that Facebook is putting into place and how these algorithms create misleading information to users in terms of the news they believe they are receiving. In her article, Bucher points out that Facebook models its homepage so that down the middle is a column titled, \u201cNews Feed\u201d which is split into two types of Top News and Most Recent. Top News is what is primarily shown in the News Feed which the algorithm for determining what is, \u201cTop News\u201d is related to pages people interact with the most and like the most. Misleading the readers then to think that everything that pops up in their News Feed is the actual News when in reality, it is just news catered to your interests which can lead to the common misinformation we regularly read about when someone ends up only interacting with news sources of one political viewpoint. This is how the power elite gains public support for policymakers that would not normally be supported by the people. Passive misinformation can happen this way where the target audiences the power elite wants to reach can use this algorithm and others like it on other social media platforms to have users engage with news sources that consistently pump out information those users agree with and could spin that information to have that policymaker sound like they agree with what the general public wants.\nThis has put America on a trajectory where information and news are not dictated by fact, but by those who have the most engagement on their respective social media sites. This is a future that Stephan Lewandowsky and his other writers in their article about the era they labeled as the \u201cpost-truth\u201d era have laid out and also fear that we are going towards. Lewandowsky and the other writers of the article look to the 2016 presidential election to show that this is already been proven to have worked with the popularity of what is said is more valued more than what is true. As they cite that an independent fact-checker known as PolitiFact found that during their respective campaigns, 70% of all statements made by Donald Trump were false as compared to the 26% of all statements made by Hillary Clinton during the campaign were false. Yet, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States over Hilary Clinton which Lewandowsky et. al. point to the fact that pro-Trump statements on Twitter were 4 times as prevalent as pro-Clinton statements on Twitter due to active efforts by pro-Trump Tweetbots that managed to skyrocket Trump\u2019s interaction with the algorithm to get more viewership and in turn popularity on Twitter than what might be anticipated. Trump exists as one of the most obvious symbols of the power elite, who has been a one-percenter since the 1980s and has been the face of American wealth for over 40 years as a business executive. As a member of the power elite and probably a member of those inner circles of the corporate community that dictate the plans that are set into motion by these corporations, Donald Trump knew how to effectively manipulate the algorithms that were set in place to allow the very thing he did, which was win the election, through understanding how to just gain enough popularity through the usage of social media to influence an entire election for the US Presidency. \nThis alone is enough of a sign for how we have entered into the \u201cpost-truth\u201d era of America. The fact that the highest office in America, which obviously in the past has been influenced by the power elite but never directly held by the power elite, was attainable through manipulation with an algorithm on a website and app used by the majority of American people should be a massive red flag to the people of America. Yes, misinformation can be combatted through diligent solo research on topics important to each individual but that alone is part of the problem. The fact that the people have to actively go out of their way to go to websites and news sources they don\u2019t normally go to, to ensure that they aren\u2019t being misinformed by the information they receive on sites like Twitter and Facebook that is catered to them by the algorithm. If an algorithm has a misinformation problem that literally placed a man from the power elite into the highest office of the United States that did not have the best interests of the majority population of America at heart and even showed it multiple times throughout his campaign, then maybe something should be done about the algorithms, not just the methods Americans should go about getting their information.\nSome people have realized the influence that these algorithms can have when controlled in such a manner. That is why as Robert Gorwa writes in his article explaining platform governance, he cites the calls in Europe and many other countries too for these social media platforms to have a form of rules and regulations that must be followed. As it stands right now on the internet, there are no real laws or regulations for social media platforms when it comes to the information they provide, or don\u2019t provide to their users in terms of the news. But, with the explorations in platform governance that Gorwa references, there may soon enough be a model for the United States to base their own platform governance laws on if what is being sought after in the EU is reliable and works to help solve misinformation and polarization issues that are so prevalent on social media platforms.\nSocial media\u2019s influence cannot be ignored. It has influenced the entire American people through misinformation and the withholding of information that hasn\u2019t ever been seen on this scale before. Yes, the power elite, who have always been in charge of media outlets have never spread misinformation on this level before, but that is because the usage of algorithms and the relative anonymity that is generally present on the internet means that they cannot be held liable largely for what occurs. If misinformation gets blamed for creating presidencies like Donald Trump where other power elites run and win, it can only be blamed on a math equation that was set up to help people see more of what that equation believes each user should see. Whether it was inadvertent or not, an algorithm has been set up across the primary American social media platforms that have been proven to be easily manipulated and when manipulated can jettison a man who nobody thought would ever be president into the highest office of the United States because of, in part, a Twitter algorithm. For better, or for worse these algorithms have significantly changed the lives of Americans, and the sooner we collectively realize the power and influence the algorithms have over us all and the information we do and do not see and that these algorithms are, to some extent, understood by the power elite to the point that they understand how they can be manipulated.\n\nWorks Cited\nBucher, Taina. \u201cWant to Be on the Top?

        "text": "Sociology 105\n29 November 2021\nOf the Past and Present\nFrom Emile Durkheim, to George Herbert Mead, to Yuval Noah Harari, sociological concepts of the past and today intertwine to create divine thoughts and ideas that challenge one another. No individual sociological thinker is the same because sociology itself is made up of the multitude of minds: creating what we know today as our world and our collective consciousness. Yet there are always inconsistencies \u2013 moments of inequities between perspectives that demonstrate how to be a sociological thinker, and how one cannot latch onto a single idea. For myself, it is sometimes hard to grasp and difficult to accept that the ideas I built my life upon were created out of a need for security and a lack of individuality. That goes for religion, collective representation, the authentic self, and the fiction that our world so easily plays into.\nEmile Durkheim states that the religion of society is important to study because \u201cthe idea of society is the soul of religion\u201d (The Cultural Logic of Collective Representation pg. 72). Durkheim concludes that religious rituals in early Homo sapiens came about from new and untouched emotion from Morotopithecus. As the emotion in our early species was created, it brought with it the capacity for symbolic thought and the connection between the neocortex and the amygdala in psychology. Durkheim believes that by studying patterns of religion in society and how that pattern was created, it is easily viable to see how new types of religions and collective representations can come about. \nYuval Noah Harari, in his book \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d and specifically in God in Part 3, details how the sociology of today impacts everything we know and do. He acknowledges the work of Karl Marx and many others, concluding that their theses helped to lay the foundation of what our world believes is true, and what we have created out of our minds that is a fallacy. Harari states that humans make God both a \u201ccosmic mystery\u201d and a \u201cworldly lawgiver\u201d (pg. 202). The idea of religion, more specifically God, is such an inconcrete thing, yet we make it the most concrete part of our lives and our collective. Each religious person makes God the answer and explanation to their own ignorance. Harari mentions that religion creates a set of rules that followers must, for lack of a better word, follow to be the best version of themselves that God will accept the most. Yet, these same set of rules also govern what humans are allowed to get away with. Harari uses the example of how some religions believe that drinking alcohol is a sin, yet a Christian woman may say that God said it was okay to have another glass of wine. These inconsistencies within people, and therefore what those people believe in, make religion and what we believe of God to be a rocky subject.\nThat is not to say that Harari disagrees with the foundations of religion that Durkheim is arguing. In fact, it is fairly correct to say that what Durkheim is arguing about religion being created out of a need for explanations is very much what Harari is qualifying. Yet, the differences in the time period and how much our world has changed throughout the decades, and even longer, reveals distinct thoughts that are separate from each other. Religious institutions that created guidelines to follow are still very much intact today, yet Harari argues that they show no difference than guidelines of government or social entities. \u201cThese laws were certainly very helpful in establishing and maintaining the social order for thousands of years. But in that, they are not fundamentally different from the laws of secular states and institutions\u201d (Harari pg. 204). Harari says that to him personally, wondering about the greatest mysteries of the universe has no connection to following a set of guidelines for a leader that were most likely made up by \u201cimaginative Homo sapiens.\u201d \nWhen considering this about Harari, what he and Durkheim conclude about religion is connected, yet they diverge paths. Durkheim states the collective consciousness is the body that allows religion to thrive and continue because people need something to believe in. Harari is arguing that we may be a more successful community of individuals that can better maintain a social order without a religious entity hanging over us. Considering the collective consciousness, Durkheim believes that the study of religious rituals has further pushed collective life into existence and collective representation, the manifestations of collective consciousness. Harari takes a tone of disapproval towards the collective consciousness, and values its negative effects of how religion and non-secularism has been forced upon the collective society, causing more harm to our mental wellbeing and what our minds can process. Durkheim wants to study why religion is a concept made of thin air, and Harari wants to dispel that same air and dissect it for what it is. Both authors believe that religion is somewhat of a construct, but they individually want to hold that construct accountable in their own particular manners.\nAccording to George Herbert Mead, our persons are separated into two entities: the self or mind and the body. Our body is material, or rather what we can see, while our self is something that cannot be accessed just by looking at it. However, humans cannot get an experience from our whole body, like for example, we cannot see our backs or internal organs. The body does not have the capacity to experience the entirety of itself, but the self is a thing that is constantly open. Our body serves as the object and is incomplete knowledge, but our self can be both object and subject and is being constantly communicated. The parts that constitute the self, or rather make it up, are known as the \u201cme\u201d and the \u201cI.\u201d \u201cI\u201d is what humans say in direct response to outward communication and is the subject, where \u201cme\u201d is the mindset, a human has in responding to themselves and serves as the object. The \u201cme\u201d shows similarities to James\u2019 Social Selves concepts. \u201cMe\u201d is what is born out of the collective consciousness, and an example of this would be a student wanting to raise their hand because of \u201cI,\u201d but their \u201cme\u201d says that the answer may be too trivial or political.\nScience fiction is a concept that humans are remarkably familiar with. It is incredibly common to flip channels on the TV and find battles between robots and aliens, or crazy machines that travel to different dimensions. Humans enjoy this type of genre because we are the only species on earth that can understand the concept of fiction and therefore further communicate it. Harari highlights that the main problem that comes with fiction, but specifically in Part 4 with Science Fiction, is that it \u201cconfuses intelligence with consciousness\u201d (Harari pg. 253). In movie scenarios, Harari states that there is always the main character who has a layer of their authentic self that \u201cremains untouched\u201d from the bindings of the \u201cmatrix\u201d and \u201ctechnological manipulations\u201d (pg. 254). The clich\u00e9 of movies creates a protagonist that watchers are drawn to because of the unlocked and untouchable part of themselves. The movie ends with the main character breaking out of said bindings and finding his own authenticity, which he then realizes has just been a myth created by the even greater \u201cmatrix\u201d that is real life.\nBoth Mead and Harari explain that each human individual has a \u201cself\u201d that is the innermost and realest part of ourselves. It is something that we can access, but of course is very personal and sometimes difficult to comprehend. However, this authenticity that we believe to be untouched is still socially structured. \u201cThere is no authentic self waiting to be liberated from the manipulative shell (Harari pg. 254)\u201d because there is no authentic self \u2013 it has already been manipulated. Our minds have no distinction between external cultural systems that we are a part of and internal beliefs that we hold. Mead and Harari qualify that we are subject to thinking that a part of ourselves is authentic because it agrees with the security we need to survive and have meaning in life. Science Fiction aims to explain that humans are constantly avoiding being trapped within the confinements of society, yet the confinement occurs from the human brain and from our own control. We are the \u201cmatrix\u201d and therefore are what we fear being a part of. Our \u201cself\u201d is both the object and the subject, and therefore it is subject to the authenticity we create within it. \nDurkheim and Mead have both immensely delved into how the human brain\u2019s symbolic thought has led it to create an authenticity that is impacted by external factors, and therefore is an internal subject. Durkheim mentions that the collective consciousness of society exists independently from humans and provides us with categories of thought to understand and follow. The collective consciousness forms moral values that we follow to be considered an individual that is accepted within society. Our \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d factor into how we are and how we want the rest of our community to see us, which are two very separate concepts. The mind-body duality and emotions that brought about religious rituals are still relevant in present time, showing that as society evolves, it does not always change.\nHarari\u2019s Part 3 and 4 of his analytical novel stretch the thought processes from what we have learned from sociological thinkers like Durkheim and Mead into how we understand our minds and external world today. He underscores that God in every religion is a divided belief of a superhero and triumphant leader, and that concepts of science fiction often have deeper meaning, like everything else in society. He connects all his ideas together in a formative matter that leaves the reader able to question everything they know about their life: the good and the bad. He challenges and negates the collective consciousness and encourages everyone to strive for a world that we create with individuality and diversity.\nOur sociology modules have given me the ability to change how I see society, how to better fix it for tomorrow, and learn to understand that not everything we believe is a reality. Sociology demonstrates how humans are cogs in a broken clock, but if that clock is built for something different, our lives may have more fulfillment. Thanks to Durkheim, Mead, and Harari, we can better reveal how the security and individuality that we so often strive for within the society we live in is missing key components: truth and humanity.

        "text": "Grace Lueders\nSOC 105-006\n2 May 2022\nThe Impact of Social Media on the Young Selves\n\tIn 2014 for my 12th birthday my parents bought me the black LG Cosmos 3 slider phone. The only functions were texts, calls, and a brick breaker game. The main purpose of this gift was that my parents could make sure I was safe when walking home from school, but I saw it as validation for my new middle school maturity. I would text and call friends to hang out, and show it off to people that did not have a phone yet. Owning that phone gave me a small insight to what I believed adulthood was like, however, it could not show me what the adults at the time were doing, thinking, saying, or even wearing. The phone itself was the symbol of adulthood, rather than what the phone provided. Fast forward to 2020, I was entering my senior year of highschool, and my youngest sister, Heidi, was entering sixth grade. Rather than getting a slider phone like I had, she got a new iPhone 8. Over the span of just six years, the representation of a phone had completely changed. Heidi was excited, yet it wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal, all of her friends already had phones, in which they had access to thousands of different applications they could download. Of those apps, the most prevalent ones proved to be social media. My sister instantly had access to the lives of not just her friends, but also her acquaintances, distant family, celebrities, and thousands of others. In today\u2019s society, access to the information social media holds forces younger generations to mature quicker, and negatively impacts the constituents that define the Self. \n\tThe changes I noticed in my sister after having a phone were outstanding compared to the changes I had after receiving my first phone. I barely changed, I still wore the same clothes, talked the same way, and had the same friends within a year of owning my first phone. Heidi, on the other hand started wearing completely different clothes, obtained many new friends, stopped talking to many others, completely changed the decorations and color of her room, got a very different haircut, and even had a large change in her everyday vocabulary, only in the first year of owning her phone. Along with the outstanding changes in her lifestyle, Heidi also obtained vast amounts of knowledge about society, including current events, the clothes people wear, the language adults use, to the shows and movies people watch, the places her friends go and the things they do, and so much more. All these changes and gained knowledge can be accounted for by the use of social media. \n\tThe intention of social media is to share what you do in your daily life, aiming to cultivate friendships and decrease loneliness, but the harsh reality of social media demonstrates vast differences from this purpose.The knowledge Heidi has been exposed to along with the changes she has undergone have taken a significant toll on her mental health. Her life on social media and her life in the real world intertwined, and has given her symptoms of anxiety and even depression at her young age. Social media has caused her to develop personality issues, the constituents that make up her sense of \u2018self\u2019 have been negatively impacted by the use of social media. \n\tWilliam James, famous philosopher, historian, and psychologist, loosely defines the Self as \u201call that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank account.\u201d The Self is made up of several different aspects, but can be separated into four general constituents; the material self, the social self, the spiritual self, and the pure ego. By becoming aware of the feelings and emotions these constituents arouse, along with \u201cthe actions to which they prompt\u201d (James 123), one can understand the self in its widest sense. \n\tThe constituents that make up the self each have their own impact on personality and the way we and others view ourselves. The material self is made up of many aspects, but \u201cthe body is the innermost part of the material Self in each of us\u201d (James 123). Other aspects of the material self are what we consider a part of us, this includes close family and friends, the home we live in, to the clothes we wear and the commodities we earned with labor. The material self is one of the largest factors in determining and expressing our personality and Self. \n\tNext is the social self which is \u201cthe recognition [one] gets from his mates\u201d (James 123). The social self is a factor people find most important, but also the most stressful. The social self is how we interact with others, as well as how others see us. \u201cA man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of them in their mind\u201d (James 123). The social self is very influential on the personality others believe we have, and your social self can vary greatly among the people you\u2019ve interacted with. The social self fluctuates the most among the other aspects, and determines our personality to others.\n\tThe spiritual self, on the other hand, changes the least throughout our life. The spiritual self can be defined by our \u201cmoral sensibility and consciousness\u201d (James 124), it is our \u201cindomitable will\u201d (James 124) that lays the foundation for our actions in society. \u201cThese psychic dispositions are the most enduring and intimate part of the self\u201d (James 124), and take a lot to be changed. We cherish our spiritual self, as it is the most personal and powerful part of the self, and most of the time can not be shared with others. \n\tLast is the pure ego, which can be defined as \u201ca wholly subjective phenomenon\u201d (James 125). The pure ego is the broadest out of the constituents, and ultimately determines our thoughts. The pure ego is said to exist prior to experience, and is unchanged by it as well. The pure ego plays a large part in our interactions and basically determines personality. \u201cEach thought, out of a multitude of other thoughts of which [one] may think, is able to distinguish those which belong to [one's] own ego from those which do not\u201d (James 125). The pure ego is the most stable among the constituents, and is untouchable due to how deeply rooted it is in one\u2019s consciousness. \nThese constituents play huge roles in determining our personality. By understanding the emotions and actions they cause, the self can be defined. Along with defining someone\u2019s self with these aspects, we can also understand how outside factors, such as other people's actions, impact the Self. \n\tMost of these aspects of the Self are influenced by interactions with others, therefore, prior to the modern society we live in, these aspects of the Self could not be easily changed. The only forms of interaction could happen in person, compared to today where there are dozens of different ways to communicate. Whether it\u2019s through a text, a call, a snapchat, a facetime, and so on, interaction has completely changed. This is taking the largest toll on the younger generations, such as my sister, who are introduced to this new modern interaction at such a young age. More specifically, the access to social media greatly impacts the development of the Self.\n\tThe development of personality and the Self happen slowly throughout a person\u2019s life. The most influential time of development is during youth, when the brain is not yet fully developed. The Self is developed through experience, as one can immediately realize they\u2019re feelings and reactions to certain events, and take in those memories to slowly develop aspects of the Self and personality. Social media has unhealthily sped up this process in younger generations by exposing them to mature concepts at such a young age. \n\tAt the age of 11, Heidi became exposed to such content. She had multiple social media apps that showed her broad concepts such as what adults wear and say, to more controversial concepts such as political news to different sexualities. This information was quickly taken in and took part in her development. Heidi also was exposed to negative content such as cyber bullying and content posted to make others jealous or feel a need to change. This content all came together to disturb the development of each aspect of the self. \n\tSocial media had the biggest impact on her social self. By having a profile on an app, you can create an instant social self. She became very stressed over this concept, and would change the photos and information on her profile constantly. She tried to seem more mature in order to seem cooler, which led to confusion between her social self and how she acts in person. This idea of social media also greatly impacted her material self. For me, the phone itself was the only part of my social self, but for Heidi the content on her phone became a part of her material self. Profiles, posts, and communications on different apps belonged to her person, and she treated these apps as if they were a part of her. She would work harder on perfecting her personality shown on her social media, rather than in person. The development of Heidi\u2019s spiritual self was sped up by her access to social media. Morals are slowly learned by experience over time, however Heidi was exposed to a large amount of content that basically determined her morals instantly. She would watch YouTube or TikTok videos that displayed strong moral decisions, and from these videos she quickly developed the sense of her spiritual self. Her pure ego was also impacted this way, as she was exposed to so much varying content in such a short amount of time. Her brain was constantly being overloaded with thoughts and impacted the development of the most important aspect of her Self.\n\tAll of the content Heidi was exposed to impacted each constituent of the Self, which in turn increased the emotions and reactions to those constituents. This overload of emotion put great strain on the development of Heidi\u2019s self, as well as her mental health. Being able to access such a large magnitude of mature content puts great strain on the development of the Self, especially when the ones viewing this content is a young person. Social media had forced Heidi, and multiple other younger people, to mature quicker and develop the Self faster. This exposure will continue to mature the younger generations faster, and will impair the development of the Self. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nJames, William. \u201cThe Self and Its Selves\u201d, Split Lives in the Modern World, 1890",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n18 October 2021\nPrivilege and Prejudice\nThere is a vast distinction between the skin colors of white and Black. One is considered privileged, the other prejudiced; and for those who consider themselves civil activists and politically inclined, then it is relatively easy to ponder a guess at which race is considered which. However, the differences between the races of white and Black for some people is much less obvious. Some may not see any difference at all, other than the obvious contrast in skin color. Others could believe the groups should be switched, and that white people are prejudiced, and Black people are privileged. A third group may think that both words are relevant and just for both races. But a privilege and a prejudice only exist because of the other. More or less, the two are codependent on each other, and they both stem from centuries of white privilege that spans throughout history and is far-reaching, all over the world. \nThe argument of this reflection is not to change the opinions of those who do not see their ignorance, but rather to change their ignorance into something that fuels a yearning for them, as humans, to be better. The color of skin, or rather a difference in the majority of a specific color of skin, is never celebrated for its difference, but is ridiculed, opposed, and put into a box where its beautiful and defining factor of color is drained to be replaced by a need for survival in a society that exists on that same ridicule and opposition. But for society itself to survive, its foundation of racism, hatred, and bigotry must be the first to go.\nI am white, and so is my entire family. We have never felt the blunt force of racism that is so engrained into American culture today, and we probably never will. One evening, my mother and I bought groceries at Walmart, and had a few bags-worth of bananas, crackers, and some form of candy. There was a man in front of us who was also carrying his groceries out towards the exit door. Some superstores like Walmart will have an employee standing at the exit doors to check that a customer\u2019s receipts match up with the items in their cart or hands that they have purchased. Keep in mind, my mother and I had a few bags in each of our hands, while the man had only one or two. The thing I forgot to mention was that this man was Black. As we all approached the exit door, a female Walmart employee stopped the man to check his receipt. She tediously looked over all the items, took her time scouting his bag(s), and then let him proceed through the exit. As my mother and I approached the employee, she simply smiled and said \u201cYou\u2019re good. Have a nice night, ladies.\u201d \nWhat is wrong with this picture? That is the first question that I asked myself. How is it that one customer has to be thoroughly checked to make sure that they have not stolen anything, but two people with double the bags and items do not? It is safe to say that this is a consistent pattern that most people would admit that they have noticed first hand in their life; and most of the people that admit that would be Black. The man at Walmart did absolutely nothing threatening, or moreover did nothing to make the Walmart employee believe that he was doing something illegal. So why is it that she felt the need to question that? The answer is a few things: the man\u2019s skin color, the employee\u2019s skin color, and my mother and I\u2019s skin color. \nI am thankful for the political movements that are constantly occurring around the world today, specifically Black Lives Matter. If I were not exposed to this, I would not even have noticed first-hand the situation that happened at Walmart. Being white in America means that the country and its institutions are programmed to be catered to what is best for you. A white person in America is not punished, hate-crimed, or downgraded because of their skin color. They never have to feel what it feels like to be the only Black person in a room, or to have their family members brutally killed by police for seemingly being \u201cthugs.\u201d I acknowledge that I have never had to feel that, and that I never will. The goal is that all white people, hopefully, will one day acknowledge that too. \nThe instance at Walmart, and so many other instances like it, demonstrate how white entitlement is still so mainstream in American culture. White privilege is defined as conferred dominance and unearned benefits that give white people more power and respect in society, merely because of the color of their skin. Because of white advantage and authority, white people can argue with authority without repercussions, gain more generational wealth, and be more likely to be hired (Pager Discrimination Study). The mere concept of white privilege already indicates that there are a group of people, in a given society, that are not white, and are therefore underprivileged. The privilege in \u201cwhite privilege\u201d does not refer to a higher amount of wealth or resources, it refers to the prerogative that is given when the color of one\u2019s skin is white. White people that are in lower income households or in poverty condemn white opportunity as a falsity, when in reality the privilege is referring to the skin color and how that promotes a white person in society. \nPeggy McIntosh, activist, and author of \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d claims in her article that all white people are racist. Speaking as a white person, it is quite common to hear that this claim is inherently \u201cracist\u201d towards white people. To say that all white people are racist would be racist towards white people, right? Wrong. McIntosh states that this racism towards people of color from white communities is a distinction between racism and prejudice. She offers that white people are not always intentionally racist, but that the institutions that they have grown up in, as well as white privilege, have perpetuated the underprivileged livelihood of people of color. Institutionalized racism refers to the meaning that schools, government, churches, and communities as a whole have created a system of prejudice that is outfitted towards white people, and exclusive towards people of color. \nMcIntosh shows how white entitlement works by using the example of male privilege in today\u2019s 21st century society. \u201cIt seems to me that the obliviousness of white advantage, like obliviousness about male advantage is kept strongly inculturated in the United States so as to maintain the myth of meritocracy, the myth that democratic choice is easily available for all.\u201d (McIntosh, 36). Men are conditioned to not see where their immunity lies and how it effects all others who are not males, and therefore not included in this privilege. The same goes for white privilege and its prejudice towards communities of color like Black, Latinx, and Asian. McIntosh\u2019s rationale for the majority of white people\u2019s racism would be because the concept of white advantage is the explanation for why white people are only aware of its positive qualities, and not its negative. Privilege highlights that white people are the top tier of the hierarchy of society, and because they have never been below it, they will never understand what it means to be a person of color.\nAnother important concept to discuss is that of racism against a majority group, in this case white people. As I mentioned earlier, it is routine for white people to frequently think that they are prejudiced against, or that people of color blaming white people for society\u2019s problems is a form of racism. The exact definition of racism is \u201cprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one\u2019s own race is superior.\u201d (Lexico). To say that white people are the victim of racism is to say that Black people are treated as royalty. The fact that America was built on the slaughter of Native Americans and the slavery of Black Americans underscores that white people are the group that has always been on top, even since the founding of the New World. Racism is not qualified when concerning white lives, because white lives have never been threatened because of their skin color. The structure of racism is a system that defines skin color, so the only way white skin is considered a positive is if black skin is first considered a negative. Reverse racism, the idea that plans like affirmative action and programs for people of color were created as a form of anti-white behavior, only exists if the concept of race itself reverses. \nWith white privilege comes its labels; and white people have always been seen as respectful and trustworthy individuals living their lives showing the same respect and trust to the society around them. The definition of Black people, however, is quite the opposite. \u201c...other groups [of color] were likely being made inconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.\u201d (McIntosh, 34). The Black man at Walmart, like countless other Black stories, was a victim of racialization. Racialization, from Omi and Winant, is the top-down political process where a dominant group defines symbolic boundaries for subordinate groups. Because the white employee at Walmart saw that the man was Black, she characterized him as a person of dishonesty and malice. \nThe meaning of skin color is constantly being communicated through the collective consciousness and is shifting over time, just as the collective consciousness shifts. After the Civil War in 1865, Black people were freed from their slavery, but they were still perceived as lowly individuals that were less than human. In fact, part of the foundation of racism was built on the fact that many white people saw Black people as a different species, such as that of a farm animal in a field. After the Civil Rights Movement in 1968, a little over 100 years later, Black people were seen more as dangerous and violent than powerless. Because civil rights groups like the Black Panthers and activists like Martin Luther King Jr. came about, there was backlash from the collective society about how safe Black people really were to be around. \nThe collective consciousness refers to the set of symbolic and shared beliefs that a society holds that informs a sense of identity. In other words, the collective consciousness is made up of everyone around us and can in turn be heavily biased towards the majority of the population. When considering this, the collective consciousness in America is made up mostly of white communities, therefore the collective consciousness emphasizes white privilege. The collective consciousness of being white is a racial formation that has been agreed upon by society. To continue, the collective consciousness brings about collective representation, and collective representation in America is American ideals of freedom and unity. But this same freedom and unity are not relevant topics when it comes to race, because neither occurs. The racism that is formed by the benefits of white privilege is an understanding that Americans have adopted because it is something that has always been there and has always been communicated. The collective consciousness, by being white in total, exposes the systemic racism that no white person has ever cared to notice or condemn the actions of. Hopefully not until now.\nWhite privilege exists. The racial formations that have been created through white privilege exist. Black oppression exists. White and Black opposition exists. As Americans, we have lived our lives by stepping on the backs of people of color because the America that we live in serves us, and us only. Maybe if the man in Walmart wasn\u2019t black, my mother, I and the Walmart employee were not white, this would be a different story. But it is not. The argument of this reflection hoped to encourage all of us, every single one of us, to do better \u2013 for each other. It is time to no longer step on the backs of people of color, but to extend a hand out towards them, and finally break apart the institutions of racism that have fought so valiantly and unacceptably survived. This is the chance for every Black parent to not have to tell their Black child to fear the world around them, but rather to embrace it with open arms. And this is the chance for every white parent to tell their white child that the world should not hand anything to them because of their skin color, and that they should embrace that with open arms. This is our chance as Americans, as humans, and as people of privilege and prejudice \u2013 to be a society of peace and pride. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n29 January 2021\nOrigins of Collective Consciousness\nAccording to sociologist expert Dr. Nicki Lisa Cole, \u201ccollective consciousness can be defined as a fundamental, sociologically concept that refers to a set of shared beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge that are common to a social group or society.\u201d (Cole 1) When looking at the readings, Microfoundations and The Cultural Logic and Collective Representations, there are contradicting ideas among the two. Microfoundations makes comparisons of homo sapiens and hominids to show parallels of consciousness. It also mentions the motives among society and relates them to doubt and fear. The Cultural Logic and Collective Representations  discusses points of individuals in society creating their own realities. It also delves into science and how people trust the evidence behind it. After analysis of the two readings, Fligstein and MacAdams take a social approach to explaining collective consciousness, while Durkheim takes a scientific approach. \nMicrofoundations was able to elaborate the similarities between the human species and ape.  Fligstein and MacAdams demonstrate parallels of consciousness through the comparison of tendencies of homo species. \u201cTools are typically regarded as a rudimentary element of culture and certainly all of the prior species in the Homo line have been shown to produce and use tools.\u201d (Fligstein and MacAdams 36) This exhibits collective consciousness through a social approach by showing how the homo species are similar through their coordination and ability to adapt to their set surroundings. Fligstein and MacAdams also demonstrate parallels of consciousness through revealing how doubt and fear relate to collective consciousness. \u201c... doubt/fear is the central motivating force in social life and yet produces little conscious awareness on the part of the individual actor.\u201d (Fligstein and MacAdams 44) This demonstrates collective consciousness by showing that society is connected through the motivating force of doubt and fear. \n\tThe Cultural Logic and Collective Representations was able to elaborate collective consciousness by showing that individuals in society create their own reality. \u201cA man does not recognize himself; he feels himself transformed and consequently he transforms the environment which surrounds him.\u201d (Durkheim 73) This process alone shows that the psychic force can be changed through the individual, itself. The collective consciousness determines what is good or bad in a society. The belief system of the individual helps to create the interpretation of reality. Durkheim\u2019s scientific viewpoint goes along the lines of collecting evidence and discussing what is right or wrong. Science is a belief system and we the people trust that process. \nWhen members of a community share a sense of morality and identity through common experiences and beliefs that can identify as the collective consciousness. There are so many collective consciousnesses today, which explains why we get so overwhelmed with the world we live in. The collective consciousness furnishes the value system in which an individual believes.  Fligstein, MacAdams take a different approach in explaining the collective consciousness than Durkheim. They do this by taking a more social perspective, while Durkheim uses a more scientific and religious perspective. ",

In contrast, there are similarities present in Devah Pager, Bart Bonikowski, and Bruce Western\u2019s field experiment in racial inequalities in the workforce and Harari\u2019s concept of immigration. Omi and Winant\u2019s work titled Racial Formations, asserts that racial inequality is a predominantly modern issue. This contradicts Harari\u2019s claim in lesson four Equality, that inequality is a far older occurrence. It is the basis of each concept which differs. Devah Pager, Bart Bonikowski, and Bruce Western\u2019s work titled Discrimination: in a Low-Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment, presents similar claims to Harari\u2019s ninth lesson Immigration, both contend that there are differences in treatment among different races within the workforce. Each concept presented can be compared to another in some way, but the most important consistency among the concepts is that they all encompass the idea that systemic racism is a present day issue. Not only that, but systemic racism has become a far larger issue than most people realize, affecting things such as immigration, the job industry, and everyday life. \nOmi and Winant\u2019s work titled Racial Formations, makes the assertion that \u201cRace consciousness, and it\u2019s articulation in theories of race, is largely a modern phenomenon.\u201d  Omi and Winant argued that racial inequalities stem from occurances of the modern world. The authors clarify what is meant by \u201cmodern phenomenon\u201d by further explaining the time period of racial inequalities emergence, \u201cWhen European explorers in the New World \u2018discovered\u2019 people who looked different from themselves, these \u2018natives\u2019 challenged then existing conceptions of the origins of the human species, and raised disturbing questions as to whether all could be considered in the same \u2018family of man.\u2019' From this perspective, racial inequality was the product of different races colliding and forming a class system. Omi and Winant view the formation of racial inequalities as a form of chain reaction. One could say this claim promotes the idea that discrimination is not a natually occuring part of human nature. This can be inferred because the authors marked the occurrence which led to the formation of racial inequality. \nThis contradicts with Harari\u2019s claim in lesson four Equality, he claims, \u201cInequality goes back to the Stone Age.\u201d Harari argues that racial inequality goes farther back than known history. He supports this claim with this statement, \u201cThirty thousand years ago, hunter-gatherer bands buried some members in sumptuous graves replete with thousands of ivory beads, bracelets, jewels, and art objects, while other members had to settle for a bare hole in the ground.\u201d Harari implies that this concept could support the idea that discrimination is a naturally occuring part of human nature. Harari states that the formation of class systems is a normal practice for humans. This would mean that because humans inherently create class systems which produce racial inequality, one could even say that humans are inherently racist. When Harari\u2019s argument is criticized in this fashion, his ideas seem far-fetched. According to the author's concept, \u201c Hierarchy was not just the norm but also the ideal. How could there be order without a clear hierarchy between aristocrats and commoners, between men and women, or between parents and children.\u201d Harari is questioning what the world would be like without classes and hierarchy. He is almost critical of a world without such structures. This claim supports the idea that the formation of classes is a normal practice for humans. However, like many of his other concepts that pose questions, Harari offers no apparent answer to this issue. \n Although this may seem like a trivial contradiction, it is actually a fundamental difference. It is the basis of each concept which differs. This distinction is the source from which racial inequality comes from in each concept. This one integral difference causes the concepts to clash. Omi and Winant assert that Racial Inequality is a modern phenomenon, in contradiction Harari argues that Racial Inequality has existed since the Stone Age. One can infer that Omi and Winant\u2019s concept does not support the idea that discrimination is a part of human nature, and that Harari\u2019s concept may support this idea. Harari poses a question of where we would be without such hierarchy, which again supports the previously stated inference. While Omi and Winant again present the opposite claim to Harari by including a summary of the biological aspect of racism which has proven to be unfounded countless times. Yet this aspect of racism is still being pursued to this day. Both of the pieces offer adequate evidence to support their claims. \nPager, Bonikowski, and Western\u2019s piece Discrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment presents their findings on the Racial Inequalities within the Workforce. According to the piece, \u201cEconomic theory predicts the decline of discrimination through market competition, but several features of contemporary low-wage labor markets may sustain or renew racialized decision making.\u201d This means that the issue of racial inequality in the workforce is a system which feeds into itself because of those who sustain it. The author goes on to say that, \u201cShifts in the composition of both low-wage jobs and workers have potentially created new incentives and opportunities for employers to enact racial  preferences in hiring.\u201d Some Employers view Racial Inequality within the Labor Force to be an \u201cincentive\u201d, meaning they benefit from it. Those who benefit from this arrangement work to continue its occurrence. This supports the prior observation of this issue being a system which feeds into itself by those who benefit from it. \nHarari\u2019s ninth lesson Immigration holds that although Racism has shifted to Culturalism, it is still present within the workforce. It has a negative effect on multiple minorities and races. It is stated within this piece that, \u201cNumerous countries turn a blind eye to illegal immigration or even accept foreign workers on temporary basis because they want to benefit form the foreigners\u2019 energy, talents, and cheap labor.\u201d The hierarchy which controls immigration allows this racial inequality to occur. Harari is alluding to the fact that immigrants are paid less than legal citizens. He goes on to say that they are allowed entry into the United States because they will be used as cheap labor. This system is continued by the hierarchy which profits from such an unjust arrangement. \nTo compare the two concepts, both present the assertion that racism, or modern racism (Culturism) does in fact have an effect on the job industry. Pager, Bonikowski, and Western\u2019s piece Discrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment holds that Racial Differences within the workforce are majorly due to systemic racism. The purpose of the piece was to highlight the differences in treatment among different races in the workforce. Harari\u2019s nineth lesson Immigration asserts that countries ignore illegal immigration because immigrants are used for cheap labor. Therefore, immigrants are only \u201callowed\u201d entry into the United States because they can be used as cheap labor. Both of the pieces allude to the differences in treatment among different races within the workforce. It is evident within each concept that there is indeed mistreatment of some races within the labor force. It is consistently implied that the system which produces the racial inequalities in the workforce feeds into itself because of those who sustain it for their own profit or well being. This is a key facet of each concept. \nIn closing, it is apparent that though the similarities and differences among each concept seem small, they involve fundamental aspects of each claim. Discerning such similarities and differences from each concept can prove to be a difficult task when approaching them from a broad perspective. The difference between Hararis concept of Equality and Omi and Winant\u2019s concept of Racial Formations, is a matter of how Racial Inequality came to be. Harari asserts that it has existed since the Stone Age, and Omi and Winant assert that it was formed in the Modern World. In contrast, Pager, Bonikowsk, and Western\u2019s piece Discrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment, and Harari\u2019s concept of Immigration have similarities. Both argue that there are differences in treatment among different races within the workforce. The pieces imply that racial inequality is the product of a system which feeds into itself by those who profit from it. As I have stated previously, each concept presented can be compared to another in some way. The most important consistency among the concepts presented, is that they all hold onto one steadfast truth, systemic racism is a present day issue that has become far larger than most people realize, affecting things such as immigration, the job industry, and everyday life. \n",

In particular they can make you act in a way that wouldn\u2019t be considered yourself. This belief of having an ideal image and your actual image relates to your self-conception.\nIn Erving Goffman\u2019s article \u201cPresentation of Self\u201d he talks about how people try to relate or be more like the people that they look up to. He uses the example of stage performers and how people will try to compare themselves to a performer. This is because of peoples need to adjust their image in order to be more in common with their ideal image. Goffman then explains how the ideal image is based off of society while your self image is based off of the real you. \nThe concept of adjusting to what social norm is also mentioned in George Herbert Mead\u2019s article \u201cThe Self, the I, and the Me\u201d. In Mead\u2019s article he explains how the other people can affect our self-conception. He explained how certain people have more of an affect on you than others. Mead also developed a theory that the \u201cme\u201d is what is learned from a social setting and the \u201cI\u201d was the response to the \u201cme\u201d.    \n",

        "text": "4/12/2021\nSOC\n\tLiberty \nHarari continues his explanation on the assault of autonomy by describing democratic systems and how they have been hijacked in today\u2019s society. HE claims that people do not vote with their heads, but with their guts. This adds into the collective consciousness as it explains that we may not always act in accordance with what we truly want but with how we are expected to feel. For example, someone with personally conservative views may vote liberal because society claims it is more virtuous and they may abandon what they believe to fit the expectations projected onto them. \nIn the middle of the chapter, he talks about the concept of truth. He claims that the only definitive truth left is the top results of google. The assault on definitive truth he claims is driven by large AI powered corporations. These corporations are only incentivized by turning a profit. So long as they can bend the rules to make that profit, they will. Even if it is at expense of the personal liberty. Harari claims that we have reached a turning point in terms of technology controlling everything, including what we think. Take for example advertisements. People claim that the devices are listening to them, which turned out to be true. However, they do not even need to listen to you to determine what to advertise to you. Google follows every click and search meaning they know if you have a dog. If they know you have a dog they know to advertise dog food to you. This again goes back to the collective conscience; this has now become the expectation. The few people who are skeptics of large corporations and data are far outnumbered by those who don\u2019t see it as an issue. \nMy generation is the first to truly grow up in a technological revolution. Computers were always there as well as large corporations competing for our data. There will come a time where this is an acceptable way of life. Large corporations will eventually successfully change the collective conscience. ",
