They have luxuries in not just designer items but services that make their life much more efficient. The sociologist Max Weber would refer to the development of services as rationalization, which is when emotional decisions replace efficient procedures that make items more accessible for some consumers but, in turn, dehumanize the people who work for these corporations. Through the growth of rationalization in the modern world, companies that rely on consumers must also evolve. This growth can be shown through limited-item grocery stores developing into million-dollar corporations. To do this, grocery stores have implemented rationalization by having certain arrangements of items, consistent training, and new-age technology that adapts to consumers who are making them more money. Since adding these systems, it has affected the working class because they are the workers being dehumanized and turned into machines since that is the most consistent service.\n Many people feel the need to get things done fast to keep up with the fast-paced life in the US but cannot afford services that will allow them more time to focus on their careers. Some grocery stores have developed so people do not need to walk inside the store to buy items. Wealthy people would rather pay someone to get an item directly than walk into a store to find it themselves. Grocery stores now have adapted to the people who want this leisure by creating grocery delivery, curbside delivery, and personal food shopping services. These services allow the wealthy to pay to get items more quickly to live a leisurely life, while the lower class must adapt to providing these services.  \nPeople still choose to go inside the grocery stores or cannot afford these luxury services, so, through rationalization, they have used people's predictability to set up their stores in the same arrangement. All stores in a specific corporation are set up the same way, so it is more convenient for consumers to go through them regardless of their area. They also have items such as cleaning supplies and drugstore items, so consumers only need to go to one place for everything. This accessibility allows customers to navigate the store quickly and find all the necessary items, enabling corporations to make more money from consumers by adapting to them. For example, people who need a dairy or meat item when going grocery shopping, stores set up those items to be placed in the back of the stores, people must walk through the aisles to get to the item they are searching for. Having to walk through makes them buy more because they see items through their walk, and do not even consider needing them until they see them. Once people finish shopping, they must go to checkout, which is set up so consumers can buy more. There are always small, cheaper items such as gum or a soda that are easily accessible while the customer is checking out, which makes them consider needing them as well. All these set-ups throughout the store are purposely in place to get more customers to subconsciously buy more items, which allowed grocery corporations to grow.\nAnother aspect of rationalization in grocery stores is that all workers are trained in the same way to allow consistency for consumers. This training can dehumanize working-class people by making them all act the same way. Through training courses, they are taught to act always of service to customers, specifically answer phones, and be in a specific uniform. Having to act the same robotic way towards every customer takes away from the personable experience lost through rationalization. Many consumers enjoy the reliability of getting in and out of the stores with no unexpected scenarios, but that is not naturally realistic in life. Naturally, nothing can be predicted entirely, but through the modern world, rationalization has made unexpected obstacles to getting something done much less likely, and even workers with strict training are not doing well enough.\nEven employees are not efficient enough for people anymore, they have adapted to better technologies. Introducing new technologies, specifically self-checkout, has made even buying items at the store more efficient but takes away from human jobs and the personability behind them working. Now, with the establishment of grocery delivery services, people limit their interaction with other humans who are just robots working for them. People in higher classes use this type of service the most because they can pay more for a more efficient process. While the lower classes cannot pay for these efficient services, they must be the ones who do them.\nThrough analyzing rationalization being used for the growth of grocery stores it is shown how there are many advantages for wealthy people but disadvantages for those part of the working class. Overall, even though rationalization has made the modern world much more efficient, it has also turned the working class into machines.",

        "text": "Leadership: Final Paper\nThe third lesson I learned, was that leadership is a collaboration and a process. A major thing I learned from Leadership for a Better World by Susan R. Komives was that leadership is not a position that someone with power or money has to gain more power over people. Instead, leadership is a process of learning about yourself while collaborating with others. This lesson ties to the previous lessons learned about becoming more self-aware about one\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and creating a concrete connection between leaders and followers. In this book, Komives further explains this through the Social Change Model of Developmental Leadership. With this model, social change was explained to me as people learning about themselves, their society, and the group they are a part of to comprehend how they can cooperate to achieve a goal. \nAt the beginning of the semester, I viewed leadership as a position that people of power or a large amount of money have. I believed leaders were more like managers that assign certain tasks to people to achieve their goals. By taking this course, I have gained more knowledge about what leadership is, who can be a leader, and the different ways to become a better leader. Leadership in itself is not a position held by someone with power or money. It\u2019s also not a manager using people to complete a goal. Instead, leadership is a process in which someone acts as a teacher or guide to help others alike achieve a common goal. This leader, or group of leaders, can be anyone for any amount of time. In the book A Long Walk To Water, written by Linda Sue Park, the main character is a young boy named Salva Dut. His story represents how leadership takes courage and motivation to create change, even if it is from a young boy in a difficult situation. Aside from positive leaders, there are some negatively motivated leaders. However, if you can connect with others and guide them to a common goal, you are technically a leader.\nOne thing I have learned about leadership this semester based on experiences outside of the classroom is that good leader and follower relationships are essential. While being a full-time student at UNCW, I decided to look for employment near campus to obtain some extra income. One day, my roommate and I decided to visit a local bakery. We walked in, only expecting to pick up some pastries. However, we were able to apply and were hired that same day. The first day, I noticed how nice the manager was and how the other employees interacted with each other. Overall, I believed it would be a lovely place to work. However, I soon learned that wasn\u2019t entirely true. Although nice, the manager was very disorganized when it came to paperwork, schedules, communicating, and leading his workers. This created a very negative connection between him and me. Due to this, I decided to find work elsewhere. I soon applied for Starbucks and received an interview within the week. During the interview, I discovered the works are labeled partners rather than coworkers, how the business is run, and how I would be a part of this corporation. I was also informed that my manager is a good example of a leader. Although she manages the store and does tell people how to work, she also leads her partners, answers any questions, creates connections with almost every customer, and will work alongside the other partners to help alleviate the workload and any stress. \nMy biggest takeaway from Leadership 211 is that leadership is not a position, it\u2019s a process. I first believed that leadership was a position or role that one takes to lead others. With this course, I learned that is not true. Although a leader tends to be the one person who takes initiative to lead and seems to control a group of people, they are guided by their followers. Leaders must go through a process of becoming self-aware and understanding their goals, strengths, weaknesses, and how they lead. They also learn to understand and connect with others to create a group of loyal and supportive followers who can help them become a better leader. Leadership is not a position. Leadership is a process of growing and connecting with other people to reach a common goal. \n\nWorks Cited\nClifton, Don. Clifton Strengths for Students. Gallup. 2017.

        "text": "Soc 105 \n10.18.21\nDurkheim vs. Awkward Silence\nSometimes, awkward and uncomfortable experiences or beliefs that connect a group of people, are seen as normal for other groups, or even society as a whole. Having a group of people come together and share values, beliefs, ideas, and morals attitudes is seen as a relatively positive concept. However, there\u2019s always a negative, or a less pleasant side. For some groups, this may be morals that other groups or society as a whole don\u2019t agree with. For others, it might be awkward or uncomfortable shared experiences that influence and alter their beliefs. In this case, why do these experiences continue to happen if they are so awkward and uncomfortable? \nA shared belief among socially anxious people and introverts, is that silence is awkward. This belief can be shared with other people as well, including extroverts. It\u2019s something that happens frequently between strangers, friends, or family. However, awkwardness and being uncomfortable are just a normal feelings that humans encounter every so often. These awkward silences typically last for only a few short moments or even a few minutes. They also happen commonly between strangers you most likely won\u2019t interact with again. Overall, it might be an irrelevant moment in most people\u2019s lives. \nMost of the time, awkward silence happens with strangers. Since they are unfamiliar, this interaction allows the people to create their first impressions of each other. In some cases, such as having an interview or meeting with someone significant, having this awkward silence could be detrimental. First impressions of strangers are typically unimportant, however, in those cases they are seen as crucial. This first interaction with important people can determine if you are able to obtain things such as being hired for a certain job or possibly new connections that could be helpful in times of need. There are multiple other instances where people encounter awkward silences with strangers. \nMost people will avoid awkward situations or situations that make them uncomfortable. An example, for some people might avoid getting on a crowded elevator full of strangers. On the other hand, sometimes you are talking with someone on the elevator and having a private conversation, but someone joins. Neither you nor the person you are talking with want this stranger to listen to this conversation, so you both stop talking. This creates an awkward silence. This stranger might feel most awkward because they unintentionally interrupted your conversation. \t\nOn another note, some people don\u2019t like awkward silence because they feel the need to fill that space. Some extroverts feel the need to constantly have people to talk to. When they are still around people, but unable to do that, it makes them uncomfortable. This also applies to the person in a group who tends to be the entertainer. In the group, they are usually the extroverted person who is always telling jokes to make everyone happy and makes light of most situations. When they are around a new group of people or in a setting that requires silence, it makes them uncomfortable because it\u2019s not what they are used to.\nThese moments typically don\u2019t last very long and seem insignificant in our overall life. Most people may not pay any mind to it. However, for those who do pay more attention to it, it can be difficult. Introverts and socially anxious  people typically stay within their friend groups or familiar people, but at times they want to interact with new people. When they start talking to new people and the conversation begins to shift to awkward silence, it affects them the most because they were actively trying to meet new people and it didn\u2019t go over well. For extroverts and entertainers, the silence is something that creates discomfort because it\u2019s something they aren\u2019t used to. Overall, this awkward silence just creates an uncomfortable situation that most people would much rather avoid.\nDavid Emile Durkheim was a French sociologist and philosopher who was born on April 15, 1858 and died on November 15, 1917. He was known as the father of the French School of Sociology for incorporating empirical study with sociological theory. In 1983, he presented the concept of collective consciousness (also known as collective conscience), in his book \u201cThe Division of Labor in Society.\u201d This is a concept that describes a set of beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes that are shared within a common group or society. The collective consciousness is manifested by society through collective representations. Collective representations are symbols, artifacts, or narratives that embodies the beliefs, ideas, or moral attitudes of a group or society as a whole. \nCollective representation can include symbols such as a wedding ring, artifacts such as football, or narratives like \u201cthe customer is always right.\u201d For a group of people with social anxiety or who are introverted, they dislike silence in social settings. This is because the silence creates a feeling of anxiety, discomfort, and awkwardness. These experiences of encountering strangers, meeting new people, entering crowded spaces, or wanting to interact with others but not being able to, happens all the time. Since those experiences kept happening, socially anxious and introverted people, as well as extroverts and entertainers, started to view silence as awkward. This led to the narrative that silence is awkward continues to present itself whenever a situation becomes too quiet and the interaction between people is interrupted or disappears.  \nThrough the collective consciousness, the narrative of silence being awkward has presented itself in many people\u2019s lives. This begins when one person experiences silence and describes it as awkward. Then, one person encounters another person, or other people with the same experience and belief. What started as a singular, personal experience, is now recognized as a more common event. When this group comes upon conclusion or opinion about the event, it becomes a collective representation of silence.\nSometimes, what connects a group of people is something that is seen as negative or unpleasant. Commonly amongst socially anxious people and introverts, they experience and dislike awkward silence. These instances can happen with friends and family, but most frequently, its between strangers. There are situations where the awkward silence lasts a few moments and seen as irrelevant later-on. Examples include meeting someone for the first and only time, getting on an elevator with other people already on it, or going to a social gathering and making small talk. However, there are situations where an awkward silence could detrimental. Examples of this would be meeting someone important or having a job interview. Along with socially anxious people and introverts, some extroverts and entertainers of the group find silence to be awkward as well. Most common situations for them would be talking to new people and not being able to hold a conversation, or they are in a setting where they must be quiet. This silence makes them uncomfortable because it\u2019s not what they are used to. Durkheim\u2019s collective representation explains this narrative that silence is awkward amongst the group of socially anxious people, introverts, extroverts, and entertainers.",

        "text": "Sociology \nEssay Brief 2\n\tBased on, \u201cThe Social Selves,\u201d by James, Our collective thoughts belong to ourselves, however we can alter them to change in human interactions and in the different ways we present ourselves to the world around us. We are the same human, however we are always fluctuating because of the idea of the self and its selves. This becomes evident as we grow older and wiser; we are the same person, however, we are increasely more knowledgeable and experienced with our life. We need to be able to distinguish these different thoughts into what is self and what is its self. \n\tIn Cooley\u2019s, \u201cThe Looking Glass Self\u201d, Our self lives in a particular mindset or idea that we put together, our imagination makes up those ideas. The way we feel pride and shame comes from our imagination or reflection from someone else\u2019s mind. This shows that you are always looking at yourself, and you see yourself in everyone you meet because you are constantly thinking about yourself, if you know it or not. Sometimes we are ashamed of who we become or ashamed of ourselves and you see that in others. This brings the idea that the looking glass self is present and this is how we perceive ourselves and others around us.  ",

        "text": "Men Are Keeping \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d Alive\n\tHow do you define beauty? There are many different ideas and views of what beauty is in society. You can look at any social media platform for example and see that there is a beauty standard that is in place, but the real question is, do you know who put these beauty standards in place? Men did. The reason that women feel the need to be beautiful even in today's society is because of men and how they viewed women in the earlier ages. \nWomen became subjected to the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d back in the late 1800s because of men and their views on women. Back then the only use for women was to be a housewife to a man, and if they did not succeed at finding a husband they would most likely they would die. Women were unable to support themselves on their own back then because as you know it wasn\u2019t until the early 1900\u2019s that women gained the rights to own land and get jobs. Because of this, women felt like they needed to compete with others to gain the most attention from the men. The problem caused by this is a separation that was beginning to form between women everywhere. Everything was always a competition to them due to the view of the men.\nThis led women to believe that their value was based on their looks and how men viewed them rather than their personality, talents, and knowledge. The women who were not considered as beautiful as others by men then developed some-what of a fear towards the other women. We can understand this because women would be forced to compare themselves to others. This caused a lot of the competition we still see to this day between women in many different fields. If a woman is the face of a business she usually has stereotypical beauty standard features. This is because it is what the business knows will draw in the most people and make the most money.\nA lot of the women who believed that they would not equate to anything because of their looks would develop mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. They would have to face this every day and have this constant feeling of judgment over them knowing that they would not be \u201cgood enough\u201d for the men. Mental disorders then led to physical disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. Women would starve themselves or throw up their food just so that they would not gain weight. They would wear uncomfortable corsets and clothing that made their features more prominent all so that men would see them as \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Women would go through all of these hardships just to please men, why? Because it is what they had to do to survive back then, but people today still show signs of this in a lot of different ways.\nAlthough the world has gone through a lot of change since these times, the one thing that has not changed is the value of beauty to women and men. For example, in society as a woman, there are times that I feel threatened by other women because of their looks. As we have studied, sociologically a man\u2019s brain is formed to look at women they find beautiful and turn away from the ones that they do not find beautiful. This impacts women\u2019s everyday lives as they may feel that they have to impress people with their looks. Being a woman in society can cause a lot of pressure because of the ideals for women that men have kept up and even the new ones they have created. \nWe had this one discussion in class where we looked up attractive men versus attractive women. We noticed many differences between the pictures that showed up for each of them. The main differences were that there was more of a variety of men than there were of women and the men were wearing more professional clothes and expressions. While the women were wearing revealing clothing with more subtle submissive expressions. This shows that there are certain stereotypes forced into women\u2019s heads for what \u201cbeautiful\u201d is. This is because men have institutionalized their thoughts and ideas of \u201cbeautiful\u201d women.\nAnother very clear modern-day example of this is shown throughout social media. When you post a picture of yourself do you post the worst one or the best one? Everyone posts their best photos in hope that people will be appealed to them. As we learned, the views that others have on us have a very high effect on the way that we perceive and look at ourselves. If someone comments on a picture that you posted saying something rude or vulgar then you are more than likely to either delete the comment or the picture. We do this because what other people say and do towards us either boosts or plummets our self-esteem. This is why we see people, especially famous women, posting only the very best photos of themselves. \nAnother very prominent yet concerning example is pornography. Pornography is one of the most money-making media productions to this day. Meaning, it gets a lot of viewers and reactions. This created another factor of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d that women now have to be worried about. This is another example of how men sexualized women by making them vulnerable to their sense of sexual self-worth. Because of this, women feel like they need to perform like the people they see when doing sexual things. This is such a bad thing that is being placed into women's heads all over the world today because of how much the media is portraying it. For example, I will e scrolling on my phone through Instagram and then randomly there is just a half-naked woman on my screen that is reposted by a page run by men. I have seen this happen to many other people as well. That just shows that men are trying to advertise women\u2019s bodies to their own benefit. \nFor a more personal reflection, the idea of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d itself has caused many problems for women in the past and present. It affects the connections that women can form with each other. In my own experiences, almost every woman I have been friends with has either left or turned their back on me due to matters dealing with men. Therefore, I have a very hard time connecting with other women because I am afraid that they will begin to find something to compete about and cause problems. As for the men, I personally have seen the way that some men discuss women and their features. It is honestly insulting some of the ways that I have seen men just bring up women and sexualize them when there was not even a conversation going on about that. It is really harmful to people especially if they have insecurity\u2019s, I would know because at the beginning of high school I was a bigger kid. I would see all of these skinny girls getting hit on by the guys and I would think \u201cI am definitely not pretty enough for guys to talk to me like that.\u201d That brought down my self-esteem and made me feel really self-conscious. At some point, I got tired of not looking like all of these other girls so I did something about it. Now I get referred to as \u201ctoo skinny\u201d or \u201canorexic\u201d. It is as if there is always something for someone to say. People do not seem to understand that the way that they talk and the things that they talk about really do have an effect on the people they talk about. \nUnderstanding the male brain is very hard. In sociology, we are taught that men feel the need to have this feeling of power over others called \u201cHegemonic Masculinity.\u201d This is a dominant form of masculinity that tells men that they need to follow the stereotypical male traits. It explains why men feel the need to maintain dominance over women and others such as their jobs. As we discussed in class, there could possibly be a corollary \u201cbeauty myth\u201d for men. When you think of masculinity what do you think of? Men are stereotypically supposed to be strong, be serious, have a good job that pays well, and providing for their beautiful wife and family. Therefore, most men probably have a feeling of fear and competition towards other men. Hence why they fight so hard for the most \u201cbeautiful\u201d women and have so much pride when they do have one. But even with this in place, men still feel so dominant over women. \nIn conclusion, the way the world views women could have been very different if it were not for the views that men had and still have of women. Women have been degraded and undermined causing them to form many different problems and trials thought out their life because of the beauty standards that are put in place by men. Even in today\u2019s society, women still have a fear of competition towards other women. If men were to focus more on the personality and knowledge of a woman rather than her looks and beauty that there would be much less tension between women. Everyone has some things that they are insecure about and being taught that you must be perfect can be very harmful to your well-being. Many women suffer from mental health issues and even physical health issues because of the way that media and men have portrayed the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d in reality. ",

        "text": "The Similarities and Differences of Harari and Sociologists\n           Harari states that all different species and societies are formed around beliefs and traditions that have been around for centuries and they have distinct social systems. However, the social systems aren\u2019t something that is genetic is based on what communities you are brought up in. In chapter 6 he compares how the Germans have been organized into six different systems which were the Hohenzollern empire, Weimar Republic, The Third Reich, German democratic republic, the federal republic of Germany, and the Democratic reunited Germany. In some of these communities, the beliefs were all different because they were made up of different thoughts and ideas and that\u2019s why they ultimately separated. They still all somewhat have kept to their original routes and ways even though the Germans went through that much change.\n He also compared primates to how some of human society\u2019s work and to evolve, for example, a gorilla pack is more like a dictatorship where there is a leader that is above all the others and then the females follow behind. Then Chimps work together more like a democratic group where there is open to more possibilities to teamwork and not just being ruled by one and less violence because if a gorilla is challenged by another they make that problem go away more so with violence. The main point in that is within those two groups things may change and rules may change but the way of doing things will stay the same.\nHarari's arguments also connect with Emile Durkheim's view on the collective consciousness which is a set of shared beliefs ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within a society. While over time in different society\u2019s although things change and all different communities keep up with time and technology they are always going to hold on to the strong beliefs and being set in certain ways and that\u2019s why Harari\u2019s and Durkheim views are similar and can be compared to each other. \n           Harari states that in any civilization or group, anything can be manifested into a common belief in a society\u2019s system especially if the society is for it. His statement says \u201cHuman groups are defined more by the changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills.\u201d Similarly, Durkheim, believes that all societies have the collective concessions to enforce and bind individuals to the moral order that a society creates. These relate to each other because even a single person within a community must follow the traditions and beliefs that have been set up by that certain society. In almost any society there is always some form of consequence for disrespectful acts, and the severity of your actions is based on where you are and what rules have been put in place.\n             Another comparison between Harari and Durkheim is when Harari discussed different anthems. He stated that if you take out the specific name of the country in almost every anthem it would be hard to tell where and what regions the anthems come from. Most anthems have to do with pride and loving and supporting their communities but some people take their county pride and use it to be harmful and negative towards others.\n            This relates to Durkheim because he believes that the social is something that we collectively create together by a shared sense of reality, morality, and identity-based on commonly shared experiences. Both of these people believe that communities need to feel a, sense of unity together to thrive, even if it means being prideful.\n           When discussing religion Harari seems to shift the meaning of religion more so on modern-day religion and how some religions have matured around science and technology. He believes that in modern-day society religion had created three types of problems. The first being technical problems which would be problems caused by natural events and how back in the day you would go to the church and ask the priest how to handle stations. Most would tell you to turn to prayer and wait for God to solve the problems instead of action themselves. The second problem is policy problems which would come into conflict with problem-solving especially if you are in a very strict religion. Say if you have a medical problem but your religion restricts you from reaching out for modern-day help because it would cause you to potentially \u201csin\u201d against your religion, would you choose to adhere to the policies that your religion has put in place or take care of the problems head-on and risk possibly sinning. The third problem that he states is identity problems which can be scary because a lot of times people will hide behind religion or use it as a mask even for things that have been done wrong. Like someone using religion as an excuse to back up a wrongdoing no matter how evil it is.\n           Unlike Harari, Alexandra Maryanski and Johnathan H. Turner believe that religion was important to society because it was necessary to bring people together based on a collective belief created/manifested by a group of people who value their religion and the rules of it. Because of a stronger development of emotions, the range that people feel about their specific religion becomes greater, therefore, they needed something to believe in and base their hope in. This contrasts with what Harari said because he doesn\u2019t quite get the importance of religion and how people like to stay on the path and follow the \u201crules and guidelines of their own religion. He thinks that people like that need to try and find a way to evolve their religion with modern-day technology and medicine.\n           While Maryanski and Turner believe and understand that religion is different in every society and community because of the beliefs that have been followed by that group they respect that and embrace it. They also believe in the ability to form relationships became very prevalent as the capacity for symbolic thought increased. They seemed to understand the critical role that religion played in the forming of civilizations more than Harari did. \nAnother example of a contrast between the two is when Harari talks about how some traditions from different religions can make many people behave unfairly and cruelly to others to the point of committing harmful and potentially causing death towards others just because they don\u2019t have the same beliefs and views. This is one of the reasons he sees religion as a problem because it can blindside so many people from realistic thinking. He states that \u201cwhen it comes to solving rather than stoking the global problems of the 21st century they don\u2019t seem to offer much.\u201d So, Harari is basically is saying that people who run to religion as a safety net are just really avoiding the bigger problems at hand.\nHowever, Maryanski and Turner believe that if a group of people from a community come together and share a belief such as using prayer as a form of protection, then they will be able to collectively create a \u201cprotective power\u201d. This is considered collective effervescence, which is the feeling of the energy that someone gains from doing something as a whole. They state that religion is the \u201csoul of society\u201d because it has the ability to bind societies together to form a community. They can go through this not only when they feel protected by their god, but just doing something as a community can give this effect.\nIn conclusion, the points made by Harari throughout this book were very interesting. Upon reading this I was faced with many points that made me stop and think for a second. When Harari talks about how the future is going to be based on artificial intelligence and technology is very scary for someone who is rising up into those future generations. As he said, many jobs will be at risk which could cause a downfall in the economy. He really makes you sit back and look at the bigger issue with today\u2019s society and that the world needs to focus on evolving as a whole to solve today's problems. Not saying that everyone needs to be the same but the world needs to come together and help each other out instead of being so against one another and being more open-minded.",

        "text": "SOC 105\nWomen and men are seen as two different types of people in society. In society, women are viewed as objects more than humans. However, men in society are told they have to be tough and not to express their emotions all of the time. Women in the earlier decades were \u201cmade\u201d to be housewives where their roles were to cook, clean, take care of the kids, and tend to their husbands. Men were to work a job so they could make money and provide for their family. Many concepts about gender roles have changed over the years and women are seen less as objects now that it is normal for them to work full-time jobs.\u00a0\nGender roles have been a set-in stone stereotype between masculinity and femininity. Up until the later 90\u2019s, women have been housewives and never been able to show their full potential in the workforce. In the reading The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Gilman talks about how a wife is \u201csick,\u201d diagnosed by husband and brother, physicians, even though she feels fine. They control her and will not let her work or even write, trapping her inside the house. The men in her home manipulate her to be bed bound for a reason of \u201csickness\u201d when she is not. This shows how the man thinks he is doing good for the woman, but it really makes women feel inferior and useless. In the reading Women as other by Simone de Beauvoir, Beauvoir talks about how women are looked at as less knowledgeable because they are female. A woman cannot think independently without being questioned of their knowledge. Women are objects in the eyes of men and what a man instills, compels the woman to believe. This history is no longer a reality with the growth over the past couple of decades. Women are finally gaining their equality.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOver the year\u2019s women have been able to overcome previous gender norms and feel as though they are more important and independent. In today's society we have females in positions of power whereas in the 19th century this would have not been reality. We also have women CEO\u2019s and leaders to inspire the future generations that previous norms have been disbanded and anything is possible.\u00a0\n\n",

        "text": "Racism and Black Stereotyping within the Media \nThis paper will seek to supply an argument that explores the issues in today\u2019s media and how the media fails to properly provide black people with the attention and resources they need. For generations racial bias has affected the way America is run, who holds the power, and whose face will be shown to the public masses. This generalized bias has slowly formed white privilege over the years, and it is clear within America\u2019s media who the main addressed audience is truly meant to be.  \nThere seems to be a clear, unavoidable connection between racism and social media because social media can pave an easy way for people to share their prejudiced views from the safety of being behind a screen (ScienceDirect 2018). With privilege preexisting in the media, so many products, news, events, etc. generalize and assist white people more than they do black people or portray white women as more beautiful or superior to black women. Also, the ability for anonymous messages and posts behind the screen can end up leading to racism, hate crimes, microaggressions and so many more things that could be used to oppress black people. Furthermore, the media can end up fueling the preexisting beliefs harbored by people with privilege and cause even more separation between different social groups. When being portrayed in the media, almost always, whites can ensure that they will be portrayed in a fine light and more people will trust what they have to say, but that usually fails to be the case with how society views black people on a screen. This relates back to Peggy McIntosh\u2019s point of never needing to harbor a fear of whether her race will allow people of power to trust her or not (McIntosh 32). Social media is definitely not the only place of imagery where we see privilege written all over it, even paper magazines will almost never fail to include a majority of white people in order to appeal to the larger public mass.  \nThe idea of racial bias exists inevitably within social media today because of what most of modern society considers to be appealing or beautiful. The media has been structured on what privileged individuals desire to see and will be interested in. Through science, everyone can begin to see how everyone\u2019s brain holds a certain level of bias, but when confirmation bias begins to form as racial bias because of past privilege and history, then the media will reflect it and America will continue to fail to grow as a country with empathy (ScienceDirect 2018). With white people having the means to control history and how it can be told, they are also able to control the media and how it is portrayed to the public. With control over the media, white people have the ability to use their superiority to skew how black people look to the public, especially when it comes to violence or sports (Carter-Francique 2016). Those who control the media can pick and choose what is revealed to the public and what is not, whether it will be fully truthful or not, and whether it will be prejudiced or not.  \nA huge example of something that white people use to try and study blackness would have to be music and movies which both hold immense amounts of racial bias. However, the given stereotypes that white people develop for black people within music or movies can be problematic because they make black people out to be so different from themself and try to assign people to fit into a different \u201cbox\u201d from their own. Humans have this innate desire to want to make things make perfect sense and to be able to fit everything into a category or theoretical box so that they can come to a conclusion about where a person belongs. However, when people look different and act differently, and cannot be related as well to them, humans will usually outcast those who are different or treat them as lower than themself, even if they do not realize they are. These \u201cboxes\u201d and developed stereotypes through media such as music and movies have helped facilitate white privilege more than ever because it can put the differences of black people on display; and although it can fascinate some and help some understand, many will still look down upon black people despite their clear accomplishments. Hip-hop, rap, and crime have been three of the biggest areas for stereotyping black people by white people and it only became more problematic when white people were allowed to publish their personal views of these stereotypes in the media.  \nRacial bias can often come from heavy amounts of confirmation bias that is already held by those who are privileged based on the color of their skin. If white people have grown up around mostly white people, and they have been raised to enjoy being around white people, they may begin forming a racial bias towards white people because that is who they know to be safe. Also, if someone is raised in a home where the caregivers only trust white people and speak terribly about people of color, that person is likely to begin forming a racial bias that black people are worse than white people. Similarly, if someone only sees white people around their neighborhood and they hear from the media to steer clear of black people roaming around their neighborhood, they may form a racial bias and choose to believe that all blacks are dangerous and cannot be trusted roaming around anywhere. This begins to spark racial biases between both groups white and black, and because of the knowledge a group of people think they now know, they form a confirmation bias about the group\u2019s race, and they become completely polarized from each other.  \nAnother example where racial bias is used is in the sports industry. Black people, and especially black women have been severely oppressed when it comes to being an athlete (Carter-Francique 2016). Black women must face the reality of holding the least amount of privilege out of any race or gender, so many of them for generations never even dreamed of trying out for a sport. Sports media represented dominant groups in order to appeal to the public eye, causing whites to rule the athletic field for years. Upper-class white men were given the power to play, watch, and share sports because of the public\u2019s belief that they were superior. Sports began to cause even more marginalization towards black people because whites were given the power to assume that black people were less capable in performing athletically than white people.  \nUnfortunately, the media fails to represent black people and provide enough necessary resources that apply to black people\u2019s needs, rather than just whites. However, the media has had these flaws for such a long duration, and they are seen as such micro flaws to the public, that the public fails to recognize and stand up to the media on this issue. McIntosh clearly states that she never has to worry about going to the store and not have a choice for \u201cblemish cover or bandages in \u201cflesh\u201d color (McIntosh 33). This is just one example of an ad you would be able to see in the media that favor white people. Commercials on tv for hair products mostly for women, but sometimes even men, will reach to the white public because their hair is considered \u201cmore beautiful\u201d or much easier to take care of. Black people\u2019s Bantu features, and bodies are not celebrated, they are forgotten and overlooked by the media industry. The media has celebrated white professionalism and white models in order to ensure that the public believes that \u201cwhite\u201d is the goal and the face of the media itself.  \nThere is evidence within the lives of the citizens of America that so many are only willing to take a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d when it comes to accepting who owns privilege, and who does not. The media never rushes to tell stories about what black people had to go through years ago in slavery, or how turmoil within the Underground Railroad should illustrate how capable and worthy they are to be considered as a human being in the same way white people are (Johnson 2015). Ultimately, these historical events have been spoken about; however, change within a society built on racism is not expounded upon often within the media. Furthermore, when the media does happen to discuss historical issues, they can still often be told by the white perspective and can only force more stereotypes on black people that they might wish to leave behind and be able to grow from. In the media industry, there is such a large platform, that it seems to be one of the easiest places for people to subtly bring about social injustice and not get caught or face challenges. Media holds ideas of white superiority and power, especially sports and social media. If someone is black and is portrayed in sports media, they may be seen as more intimidating or fear-striking than someone who is performing and is white which can point back to racial bias.  \nIn conclusion, racial bias and stereotypes towards black people are deeply embedded into society\u2019s media. Due to these stereotypes being inevitable, black people have had to accept that their needs would always have to be second behind whites, and the media would never put them on display for the public to follow. Generations of conformational bias have caused the public to be more fearful of black crime, to avoid counting black people\u2019s resources as unimportant compared to their own and categorize black people into a \u201cdifferent box\u201d from their own allowing for oppressive behavior to occur.   \nThe domination of white privilege throughout America has silently kept the \u201cmicro\u201d issues in the dark so that people have become so numb to them, they hardly recognize there is any problem at all. For change to occur within the media, there must ultimately be identification of white privilege by those who are behind and in front of the camera. White privilege is not an invisible, negotiable topic, it is the reality of everyday American society that must face change. Peggy McIntosh further explains this is her list from White Privilege where she describes basic everyday things, she will never have to be fearful of. It would be easier to ignore the racial bias people harbor every day or in the media, or easy to ignore the privilege that white people own, especially if someone is in fact a white person; however, without recognition and empathy, America will continue to suffer as a whole. \n \t\n \nWorks Cited  \nCarter-Francique, Akilah R, and Michelle F Richardson. \u201cCONTROLLING MEDIA, CONTROLLING ACCESS: THE ROLE OF SPORT MEDIA ON BLACK WOMEN'S SPORT PARTICIPATION.\u201d Search ProQuest UNCW, 2016, search-proquest-com.liblink.uncw.edu/socabs/docview/1867156484/C412950678C94E2BPQ/4?accountid=14606#.  \nJohnson, Latoya. \u201cFROM THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT TO NOW: (RE) EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND BLACK FEMINIST THOUGHT.\u201d Search ProQuest UNCW, 2015, search-proquest-com.liblink.uncw.edu/socabs/docview/1842827817/CA1236EB767D4CC0PQ/1?accountid=14606.  \nWww, www-sciencedirect-com.liblink.uncw.edu/science/article/pii/S0160791X18300630. \n \n",

        "text": "SOC-105-001\n\n21 Lessons for the 21st Century Through a Sociological Perspective\n\nYuval Noah Harari is an israli historian and professor of in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He has also written many books such as: Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankin, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. A key theme in his belief system is that human society has mostly been driven by our capacity to believe in fiction. Our collective belief in fictions, which we give meaning to, establishes a cooperative basis for existing as a community. Among his bestselling books is 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, which goes into greater detail about this key belief among other things. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century Harari explains his opinions on various social dynamics and dilemma\u2019s using historical and sociological evidence. While some of his points complement the writings of the authors who we read in class, Harari holds some opinions, which outlined in his book, contradict certain writings. In other words those opinions hold little sociological ground. This semester we have covered a wide array of topics, the origin of man, class in America, race and enthinicty as well as our conception of self. Through deeper analysis we can conclude to what extent the content of this semester corroborates Harari\u2019s opinions or whether it does at all. More broadly, we can determine, of his opinions, what contradicts or complements what we have read and learned in class. The conclusions of this analysis will serve as a good foundation for identifying where sociology played a role in the formation of his ideologies. \nClass systems have existed throughout time as a means to subjugate individuals through diminishing their worth and propping up a minority as a result. These systems sow inequality into a community which yields a hierarchical placement of people in the upper, middle or lower classes. The Caste System in India works similarly, you are placed, from birth, in a caste which automatically assigns characteristics to you accordingly. These characteristics are not equal to others, but determine your freedom and worth throughout your life. Ancient Greece and Rome had similar systems but like India\u2019s they were blatant at keeping people down. In the United States, a kind of caste system exists but is not as obvious. Gregory Mantsios explains in his essay, \u201cClass in America\u201d, Americans are too afraid to distinguish the economic differences between their fellow citizens and the power of oppression in the class system largely keeps people in the class they were born into. The class a person is born into affects their life more than they know, and their unwillingness to recognize it propagates the reach and longevity of the system. This inequity takes two prominent forms, power and wealth, which are the mechanisms used to either give or prohibit the assumption of power. It is almost as if the country is a large company with a few very powerful and rich executives with most others serving as worker drones. Yuval Harari\u2019s arguements, in part 4 of his book called Truth during the Post-Truth chapter, complement Mantsios\u2019 analysis. In this chapter Harari explains that humans have always been living in a post-truth age, this is in line with his key belief that humans naturally believe falsehoods or fictions. Fake news if you will is necessary for classism to work, instilling false beliefs in a lower class can garner submissiveness and compliance. The American Dream is a prime example of how hope and fiction collide to produce a misguided but effective belief for the lower class to cling to. The dream itself states that anyone can achieve monetary success so long as they putforth the necessary effort. This is provably false, statistically and sociologically, it can be observed that not anyone can achieve success due to barriers like race, creed, economic satus, and a host of other variables. It is conveneient a lie however, because many people believe it and as such comes a variety of other sub beliefs that reinforce the class system. Beliefs like, the United States fosters an even playing field and no one can have too much money if they earned it working hard. Harari\u2019s post truth argument also finds an important role in rendering Americans ignorant of the facts. Words like socialism and communism get used interchangeably by politicians despite being different ideologies, so as to scare Americans into believing the U.S will slip into communism should policies be enacted to give the middle and lower classes more or even as I see it. By falsely claiming basic quality of life policies for average Americans are akin to socialism or communism creates a negative association and infringes on the misguided, inherent, belief that everyone should make it on their own, in effect reinforcing the class system. In part 4 of his book Yuval Harari\u2019s writings about post-truth and fake news serve as a foundation for allowing what Gregory Mantsios described in his essay about class in America. False ideals and fictions believed by the public supported and continue to support the class system in the United States by obscuring individuals perception and understanding.\nA civilization is defined by Merriam-Webster as, \u201cthe condition that exists when people have developed effective ways of organizing a society and care about art, science, etc.\u201d It seems from the definition that we as a collective of civilizations each with our own cultures, values and appeciations. At one time there existed merely one civilization of humans on earth. A small tight-knit community of people who shared common beliefs and acted their individual roles to help better the community. However, over time that civilization has grown exponentially and branching wildly in varying directions. Through this, it has become many distinct civilizations existing with each other but not exactly together. Harari argues in the civilizations chapter that we emerged from one and remain one, where it concerns human civilization. He claims that we are one civilization, something which might have been true thousands of years ago but as the world became more complex people divided themselves into smaller groups effectively making new ones. Each country is like its own civilization and because each has it own set of values, beliefs, et cetera, when they collide with others conflict can emerge in the form of xenophobia or war. It can be observed that when differing beliefs come together, each end will mostly try to rein supreme, which means they not only hold on to their beliefs but actively advocate for it over others. Many Americans, for example, fear immigration because they believe members from a civilization merging with theirs would infringe on or change the ideals they subscribe to. In our race and ethnicity module, Tomas Almaguer describes in his essay, the process of racialization. A process in which a group will ascribe ethnic or racial characteristics and identities to a group that they do not belong to themselves. Almaguer describes that Puerto Ricans and Mexicans had preconceptions of eachother according to the way race is defiend in those countries. They had taken to establish a conception based on more than that which they have been exposed to in their country. I think this contradicts what Harari presumes about civilizations because there appears to be no global lens through which to look. Although Harari argues that we are all members of the same civilization, we do not acknowledge each other like we are members of the same community, something that is integral to existing as one. \nYuval Harari\u2019s book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, outlines many interesting opinions and highlights some observable facts within society. Many of his points seem to rest on sociological ground as well as statistical ground. His post-truth argument is especially interesting as it has a significant role to play in both small and large things. Its application to class in America bolsters Gregory Mantsios\u2019 overall point that Americans do not realize the rampant inequity that plagues their country and creates an uneven playing field. However, not all of what Harari says complements what we have learned in class. His assertions about the existence of a global civlization seem to contradict what Tomas Almaguer writes in his Essay, \u201cRace, Racialization, and Latino Populations in the United States.\u201d He writes that individuals create images for themselves about others in a racial group that they do not belong to according to how race is defined within their country. Regardless of whether we live in a single civlization or not this concept severely limits the extent to which it exists. Nevertheless, 21 Lessons for the 21st century provides insight and greater context to many of the topics discussed this semester, reinforcing my understanding of sociolical thinking and analysis. \n\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\u201cCivilization Definition & Meaning.\u201d Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civilization. \n",

        "text": "Soc 105\nCollins argues that race, social class, and gender comprise interlocking systems of oppression or a \u201cmatrix of domination.\u201d This goes deeper than just men dominating women, but that oppressed people have been dominated by others of higher \u201cvalues.\u201d Everything being more materialistic than humane to any person no matter what race, gender, or social class they are. Collins talks more on how gender equality is hard on women but even harder on women of color. Collins highlights the point that black women in a house are more likely to be emotionally or physically abused by their partner, which reflect practices that African American women are completely opposed to. Black female spheres of influence constitute potential sanctuaries where individual black women and men are nurtured in order to confront oppressive social institutions. These institutions help tie communities together while also being ran by African American women, a huge accomplishment in that area of feminism and growth for the black community.\nThese two readings correlate in the sense that feminism has grown to become a group of women who have changed how society views gender. The equality for women has grown tremendously and women can now express themselves the way they want and not feel dominated by men. Although this world has not become fully equal in terms of gender and race, it is evident that it has gotten better and will continue to grow.\n\n",

During the Coronavirus pandemic that the world is currently still facing, many challenges have arisen that affect people's everyday lives. The COVID-19 virus has proven to be very injurious to human lives in relation to their health, their finances, their labor, and much more. Throughout this paper I will discuss how the Coronavirus pandemic estranges individuals from their labor, fully destroys people\u2019s relationship with their work, and can even harm a person's overall identity.\u00a0\n\tIn class, we educated ourselves about capitalist societies in module seven. Throughout this module we read two discourses about humans in relation to these societies. In the writing, \u201cEstranged Labor,\u201d Karl Marx does an in-depth analysis about how labor in a capitalist society can be alienating for the worker in numerous aspects. Through the action of labor, workers can be isolated from the product, the process, each other, and themselves. The individual worker does not possess the product that is being produced, and therefore the more that they make, the less they actually own and the more segregated they become. In addition, the worker is solely performing the labor as a mechanism to survive and not for their personal contentment. This idea of labor being forced is also explained in \u201cThe Spirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage\u201d by Max Weber. Weber elucidates how people rationally devote their entire lives to making money, which expands upon how the labor merely serves the purpose of providing individuals with revenue. Since the labor is not voluntary, the worker remains unsatisfied and is alienated from the process. The forced labor can also estrange people from their own bodies and their human potential because their life activity is only a manner to physically exist. Finally, there is also the potential for the worker to become isolated from other workers in capitalist societies. Marx explains how this separation from each other occurs due to the competitive manner and the breakdown of labor in this economic system.\n\tThis complex alienation that workers face occurs naturally in a capitalist society. Therefore, the detachment is already present within working citizens' lives. However, the estrangement becomes exaggerated and worsened through the presence of a crisis, such as a pandemic. The COVID-19 virus has been extremely damaging to human life in relation to their labor. This virus has been researched and was discovered to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Due to this, the most efficient way to prevent the virus from rapidly spreading during the early stages of its emergence was to shut down unnecessary industries and restrict individuals from leaving their own homes. Therefore, this led to the forced shutdown of some companies and the failure of other businesses because they could not make enough profit to survive. The pandemic led to a record number of people becoming unemployed, more than ever before.\nNumerous studies have been conducted that show the implications of this virus on the world. One of these studies is titled, \u201cExperiences of Latinx Individuals Hospitalized for COVID-19, A Qualitative Study\u201d and was written by thirteen certified researchers. This inquiry interviewed sixty citizens of Latin America, both male and female, to divulge how the Coronavirus pandemic directly affected these individuals. This investigation revealed that only 9% of the people were able to work from their houses, only a fifth of them were able to get money for a leave due to illness, and nearly 40% of them lost their job entirely due to the pandemic. In addition, of these individuals who lost their jobs and had to adjust their work environment, slightly more than 70% of them were deemed essential workers. Aside from numerical discoveries from the examination, the information also concluded that the COVID-19 widespread disease generated economic fears and disadvantages, social drawbacks, and labor issues (Cervantes et al. 1). The social downsides described in this article are a result of humans being forced to remain in their own homes. The forced social distancing, due to this virus, prevents individuals from interacting and leads to them becoming extremely isolated. Although not all of this isolation is related to labor, it still significantly impacts people and their connections to other humans, society, and even their own self-perception. Together, these implications can inflict damage upon a person\u2019s overall identity.\u00a0\nThe above study performed in Latin America also unveils the effects from the Coronavirus specifically in relation to labor. The individuals in this inquiry experienced estrangement from their career, impacts on their relationship with their work, and consequences on their overall identity as well. The approximate 10% of people who continued working, but solely from home, experienced increased isolation from their co-workers due to the transition from in person employment to online employment. This isolation is added onto the previous segregation these people already faced, as described by Karl Marx. The nearly 20% of workers who received paid leave, as well as the 40% who lost their jobs entirely were fully stripped of the chance to form a relationship with their labor. In addition, having no occupation takes away an individual's ability to rationally devote their life to working, as described in \u201cThe Spirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage\u201d by Max Weber. Together, the increased alienation and unemployment then go on to harm an individual's overall identity. This is because they are no longer able to achieve a level of occupational status, which is the social ranking that derives from the labor one does.\u00a0\nAnother study conducted in relation to COVID-19 also demonstrates how the illness leads to complications between an individual and their relationship with their labor. This analysis is titled, \u201cForecasting major impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on country-driven sectors: challenges, lessons, and future roadmap\u201d and was written by seven reliable researchers. The findings of this article reveal how the virus has been brutally challenging for citizens of the world by specifically examining the effects of the disease on India. The main challenges revealed through the article are economic damages, the shutdown of education centers, disaster in the healthcare industries, harm to international and local businesses, and impairment to the transportation, power, and oil industries (Kumar et al. 20-21). The damages done to all of these industries and aspects of life can be unified through the common theme of isolation. Shutting industries and education centers down leads humans to become segregated from other individuals, as well as aspects of their own life, such as their education and work. In addition, all of the harmful economic effects and the effects on businesses have led industries to fail and shut down. The article even states that, \u201cDue to maintaining social distancing, the sales of the industry stop and all the companies are facing financial loss and closure\u201d (Kumar et al. 9). This shows how the Coronavirus has caused companies to cease to function and individuals to lose their jobs. As previously mentioned, when individuals no longer have a profession, they also no longer have the chance to maintain a relationship with their labor. The elimination of this occupational relationship, as well as the greatly increased alienation from their coworkers, harms a person's social identity.\u00a0\nHowever, the forced shut down of businesses not only takes people away from their own careers, but it also takes them away from other businesses. This then ruins their opportunity to go out and spend their money at these places. Throughout module seven, we learned about commodities in addition to humans' relationship with their labor. Commodities are essential to society because they captivate people and provide them with a motivation for their labor, which also shapes the productive and consumptive social world humans reside in. Commodities also give people a chance to develop their own identities, by allowing them to purchase materials that supply their life with meaning. However, in order for these commodities to exist there must be both a workplace and workers to produce them. Therefore, when businesses shut down and people lost their jobs due to the Coronavirus, the number of commodities diminished also. This directly impacted both individual human identities, as well as society as whole.\nA third study conducted by qualified researchers reaffirms the harm done by the pandemic. This examination is titled, \u201cAssociation of job loss, income loss, and financial burden with adverse mental health outcomes during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Thailand: A nationwide cross-sectional study\u201d and analyzes the effects of the Coronavirus on Asia. For this particular investigation, the researchers examined nearly 2,500 adults who were actively employed with full time jobs during the shutdown of the nation. The conclusions of the study were summarized by the loss of professions, income loss, and financial issues due to the outbreak of the disease. The conclusions continued on to prove how these economic complications then went on to create higher levels of stress, anxiety, and mental health problems in individuals (such as depression). The analysis directly states that \u201cparticipants who reported losing their job had 51.9%, 56.9%, and 84.7% prevalence rates of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived stress\u2026 income loss showed a slight association with depressive symptoms\u201d (Ruengorn et al. 4). This quotation from the study discloses how individuals' mental health was harmed as a direct result from the elimination of a relationship with their labor. Overall, this shows how when a person is severely alienated from their work and loses the association they have maintained with their labor, their health suffers as a result. When a persons\u2019 mental health is diminished their quality of life is also harmed, which can alter their self-perception and overall identity as well.\u00a0\nTherefore, the Coronavirus pandemic has been proven to estrange individuals from their labor, fully destroy people\u2019s relationship with their work, and even harm people's overall identity. Although the above studies were conducted by examining individuals in Thailand, India, and Latin America, the damage done to the people within these locations resembles the destruction done to the rest of the world as well. This detriment has stemmed from the shutdown of nations throughout the world, which has led to changes in work environments, destruction of companies, and more unemployment than ever before. These alterations have caused people to become more isolated from numerous aspects of their work, such as their co-workers and the process of their labor. People who fully lost their jobs no longer have the opportunity to have a connection with their occupation and as a result have had impacts on their identity as well. The negative implications from COVID-19 on peoples working identities can then change the way people feel about themselves and adjust the way they act in society, which will further impair aspects of the social world humans reside in down the road. Pandemics have much more harmful characteristics than the simple health consequences they provide. The Coronavirus, as well as other widely spread diseases, can harm individuals' identities, economical aspects of the world, and socialization within the world as well.\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nCervantes, L. et al. \u201cExperiences of Latinx Individuals Hospitalized for COVID-19 A Qualitative Study.\u201d JAMA Network Open, vol. 4, no. 3, 2021, pp. 1-15.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t                                   doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0684.\n\u201cGuidance for Beaches During COVID-19\u200b.\u201d Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/public-beaches.html.\u00a0\nKeni, Raghuvir, et al. \u201cCOVID-19: Emergence, Spread, Possible Treatments, and Global Burden.\u201d Frontiers, Frontiers, 11 May 2020, www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00216/full.\nKumar, Saket (03/2021). \"Forecasting major impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on country-driven sectors: challenges, lessons, and future roadmap.\".

        "text": "Final Paper\nSOC 105-001\n4/28/2021\nEqual Pay in the Workplace for Women \n\tUnequal pay has been a tremendous issue in the workplace for many years and more than ever inequality between men and women in the workplace and is being noticed and changed. Throughout the centuries, gender is viewed as an accomplishment or an achieved aspiration for society because individuals can do their gender while working in society. For women working in the workplace, their gender may not always be done or noticed. Gender is a complex that is associated with not only biology but internal and external forces. Gender is a display of behavioral traits, which makes gender roles in society noticed and not easily changed. Often, we look past the unequal pay the workplace between men and women since gender is being displayed and people, like males, are doing their gender in society, and many women are unable to do so. \n\tLooking at gender discrimination in the United States for women, a high percent of women in the United States have reported gender discrimination and multiple types of harassment by coworkers in multiple professions (Steelfisher Methods). Looking deeper into the data collected, 18 percent of women reported discrimination in health care settings, and 20 percent of women have reported discrimination in higher education settings (Steelfisher Principal Findings). This information leads to the conclusion that most women experience discrimination and harassment at some point in their lives, whether it is in the workplace or at a grocery store. This has an impact on the safety of women in the workplace as well as their overall health may decline due to these findings. A workplace should feel comfortable for the workers as well as the customers, or people will not be returning. \n\tThe evidence for this study conducted on 1596 women between the span of four months showed that gender discrimination impacted health of these women negatively as poor physical and mental health and increases blood pressure, stress on the body and heart disease (Steelfisher 1 Introduction). Questions were asked about discrimination in places such as housing, health care, police, courts as well as education and employment. The questions were geared towards violence, discrimination and avoiding specific institutions of the result of fear. Overall, the results summed up that women have reported violence and discrimination in areas outside of the workplace, for example, governmental institutions, health care, and higher education, which leads to negative impacts on physical and mental health. Addressing these issues to companies and corporations will bring this percentage down as well as make women feel safer in the places that they are supposed to feel safe in the first place. \n\tSimilarly, negative health outcomes due to higher stress caused by discrimination in the workplace will lead to physiological stress responses and a decrease in a successful performance with daily tasks in the workplace (Steelfisher Conclusions) to decrease this happened, specific steps need to be taken in order to change the discrimination in the workplace against women to zero percent. This can be done by workplaces teaching and addressing staff on how to treat each other in the workplace. Making this change, will not only help women feel comfortable in the workplace, but feel comfortable in their homes and doing daily activities. Education for this subject will need further improvements to make sure that discrimination against women, particularly those of racial and ethnic minority as well as LGBTQ, (Steelfisher Conclusions) to make sure the workplace in the United States stays comfortable for everyone. Bringing visibility to these issues will further the conversation and impact the careers at hand. \n\tWhen it comes to understanding the pay for women and children it is mostly referred to the \u201cFamily Gap\u201d (Waldfogel 1). This gap is directly related to women with children and without children in the workplace. The unequal gap between men and women is still noticeable however, this gap usually goes unnoticed because of the way it is explained and some find it difficult to understand. This has to do with maternity leave and how it raises women\u2019s pay over childbirth. Over time, women\u2019s\u2019 wages compared to men have gone up due to women\u2019s human capital rising and women have been increasing time and investment on education and less on the labor market or workforce (Waldfogel 2). Gender gap and the unequal pay between men and women may be rising due to the fact of the existing family gap in the United States, and it not being present in other countries (Waldfogel 4). It is known that there is a family gap present in the United States since there is a 10 to 15 percent penalty for women with children and women without children in the workplace based on education and work experience. As well as there is no family penalty for men, making this an even bigger issue to evaluate (Waldfogel 7). The cause of this gap comes from the fact that women with children and women without children have differences in full-time and part-time work experience as well as overall work experience and education for the job at hand. Discrimination against women with children in the workplace is also considered because women are not paid for maternity leave, and they may not have the time in the day to work long hours like women with no children. Overall, protecting maternity leave under the job will possibly raise women\u2019s pay and then maintaining their job and benefitting from the specific human capital (Waldfogel 14). Women that are employed in larger firms in the United States will in turn receive maternity leave coverage, and that women are more likely to return to the same workplace after maternity leave, in turn raising women\u2019s pay, wages will increase, and they will continue to work for that specific company. As we examine further in the differences between women with children and women without children working in the workplace, women with children will be paid less due to if they have maternity leave with the same employer as well as their time is not mainly focused on the work, like women without children; the time is between the woman and her children and the workplace, making less hours for the woman to work thus, getting paid less. \n\tDealing with equal work but an unequal pay status showing the United States that there is \u201cgender equity in terms of workload but inequality in terms of pay and status\u201d (Dobele 3). Universities dealing with unequal pay and a higher workload in the workplace, may lead to lawsuits and this is not always mentioned, however it is a serious issue that needs to be discussed. This study done between two Australian mid-tier universities, that focused on two areas, teaching responsibilities and the research output for the study (Dobele 6). Assessing to the gender imbalance in the workplace will not only improve the functions and responsibilities for the company or university but improve the quality of work being done and how fast it is being completed. The study showed that fewer women were employed in the senior rank jobs, and more males were seen present in those positions. With some positions in the workplace having the same workload, a person getting paid more for doing the same tasks should not be the case. Overall, the research concluded that the second University with more female staff than University 1, were less research based when compared to the second university. Both universities also had more women that were employed into the junior ranks than men. This shows that women are at an effect for being in junior ranked professions, with women exceeding for the Associated Professor and Professor ranks; the highest ranks, yet still paid less for the same amount of work (Dobele 7). This research and conclusion for this study is that unequal pay still exists even though some employees are working the same workload at a University or place of employment.\n\tThis could be the result of not many women being skilled in that specific field of work, (Dobele 10) however this number has been increasing due to women\u2019s access to education increasing and the increasing interest in certain professions being available for women in the workplace. This is called the pipeline argument as explained by Dobele, and the explanation for the academic or university level gender gap is due to factors like family circumstances, or living situations, as well as social capital, work experience, education, the differing positions between researching and teaching the material at the University. Compared to men, women tend to switch careers or prefer part-time over a full-time workload. This has to do with personal choices, not related to the work environment itself. \n\tIn conclusion, there is a significant gap between the pay in the workplace between men and women based on the multiple studies done on the issue. With the three research studies, women with children are increasingly underpaid due to the maternity leave compared to women without children. The gender gap is present through multiple factors like family background, socioeconomic issues and gender inequality with wages. Each company handles their pay differently as well as their work schedule and work environment, however each company or University should be mandated to have equal pay between all co-workers including women with children and women without children, men in higher positions, and women in higher positions. This should be mandated through policy checks as well as mandated meetings on this issue to keep education present and each co-worker has knowledge of this issue. Helping close the wage gap will lead to everyone feeling safe and against discrimination in the workplace, making for a better work environment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nSteelfisher, Gillian. \u201cGender Discrimination in the United States: Experiences of Women.\u201d Wiley Online Library, 29 Oct. 2019, doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13217. \n\nWaldfogel, Jane.\u00a01998.\u00a0\"Understanding the \"Family Gap\" in Pay for Women with \n          Children.\"\u00a0Journal of Economic Perspectives,\u00a012 (1): 137-156.\n\nDobele, Angela R.

        "text": "Essay Brief 7\n\n\tThroughout life, labor and capitalism are an important topic when discussing how humans communicate with each other, as well as work in society together. With this comes the social hierarchy that is created through exchange values. This is where labor is stratified according to its specific value in society. This then ignores the social relations required to produce this specific commodity. \n\tSomething about modern life that makes sense to me would be the discussions featured Weber\u2019s writing, \u201cThe Spirit of Capitalism\u201d. This is because everyone in society is producing new ideas, new ways of thinking, and new problems to be solved. This is because of the rapid growth of society and how well people respond to their surroundings. When shown a specific object that everyone owns and has, people will be more likely to purchase the product due to the idea of conformity. A quote that can explain this would be, \u201cNo one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will arise, or there will be a great re-birth of old ideas and ideals\u201d (Weber 2). Modern capitalism is seen as a re-birth of something new to make all the functions of different social groups work. Capitalism supports freedom, innovation and opportunity, however that can become a shadow behind conformity, because that is how society is socially structured. \n\tAn example from my own experience to provide this illustration would be when I was about 10 or 11 and I was very into fashion, clothes, and jewelry. As a young girl growing up in the 2010s, I was able to express myself in many ways. One-way would-be, headbands. Every girl had the same exact headband from the same store, and I wanted it just because everyone else had it. I did not know it at the time, but I was conforming to society and going with my social group starting at a young age. This idea explains the ideas that conformity can have on society as well as the freedom and expression it allows in return. A quote that can further explain this idea would be, \u201cWith its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world\u201d (Marx 5).\n\tIn conclusion, the ideas of Marx and Weber, illustrate the ideas of how modern capitalism came to be and how the effects of the system have on society and the way society is brought together. Capitalism is competition within a free market, and society is able to conform and contribute to that in many different ways, and this is through supply and demand. ",

        "text": "0990\n1 May 2023\nThe Dangers of Beauty Standards in Modern Society\nWhy are beauty standards so prevalent in our culture for women? What are these beauty standards or abstract ideas of beauty in regards to women? What are the dangers of these societal standards? Are men the perpetrators of these ideas, and if so, how should men in society respond? The beauty myth is a dangerous and flawed social concept that encompasses the idea that women should be judged and bound by their physical appearance. One does not have to look very far in modern society to see the ideal picture of a woman society paints. Popular culture, television, magazines, movies, and social media have had a substantial influence on the beauty myth, and have advanced the idea of beauty standards and expectations for women drastically. This phenomenon has led to an exponential rise in eating disorders, plastic surgery, anxiety, and depression. The power structure of society has a substantial role in the development and sustainment of the beauty myth. Men also must take ownership of this truth, if men have a role in the beauty standards that women feel, how much more responsibility do we have to combat the harmful ideology? Men must become active in fighting these beauty standards. Passivity among men in regards to these standards as well as advancement of them has led to substantial harm among women and even young girls. The beauty myth is a complex and substantial issue in modern society that must be acknowledged, addressed, and combated. \nFemale beauty standards and the beauty myth are something that I have not experienced directly as a man throughout my life, but I have experienced the dangers of these ideas deeply and personally through my family. It was a cold and snowy day on November 20th, 2002. That night at 9:37 PM, I experienced the light of this world for the first time. Eighteen minutes prior, my twin sister was born with a loud cry and tears of joy from my parents. Never in their wildest dreams did my parents ever think that they would have twins. Twins do not run in our family, and we were miracle children. We were born at 28 weeks weighing 2.2 and 2.8 pounds. Twins being born two months prematurely can be a very complicated and complex situation. We were immediately rushed to the NICU where we resided for six weeks after our birth. I am told that my sister and I were practically inseparable in the weeks following our arrival on this earth. I never cease to be fascinated when thinking about this fact. We were not even supposed to be born at that point, yet our bond was already so strong. The connection of twins is almost inexplicable. Growing up, we always were bombarded with twin telepathy jokes and banter. Obviously I was never able to look at my sister with x-ray vision and read her thoughts, but in some ways there is some truth to that old joke. Growing up we had a bond like nothing I have ever experienced. We did everything together, shared everything, and walked through early life together. She was all I ever knew and the closest person to me, and still is to this day. Looking back at our childhood I remember the Barbie dolls and makeup she would play with. It is very intriguing to be twenty years older and wiser and reflect on things I never could have noticed back then. Every Barbie doll had the same figure, the same blonde hair which my sister did not have, and reflected the images on the covers of magazines. In hindsight, I now am able to see the damage that those images had in my sister's mind. In no way am I claiming that Barbie Dolls are inherently evil, but I am raising an eyebrow at the ideology behind the cookie cutter nature of these dolls and the intent of the institutions that were responsible for the portrayal of the \u201cideal\u201d female figure. \nWhen my sister and I were about 5 years old, we decided to each pick out some hobbies we wanted to try. I grew up playing piano and music was just my passion, but I wanted to try baseball and see if I enjoyed sports. My sister chose dance to try. Madison was born to dance. Dance is a part of her, it lives within her and is her way of expressing everything. The two of us are very passionate individuals. As we grew up, all each of us thought about were baseball and dance respectively. Baseball became a huge part of my identity. Dance became a substantial part of hers. She was just simply a dancer. She danced all day and dreamed of dancing on the big stage in front of thousands of people. Dance was her passion. As we grew into our pre teen years, dance became extremely competitive and challenging for her. The routines themselves were always an easy task for Madison, the real challenges of the dance world were tackling the intense social atmosphere of it. I remember being twelve years old and noticing the harsh environment and the intense nature of the dance world. I would even have conversations with my mom about how intense everything seemed. Within this competitive world of dance, body image is an enormous deal. Every dancer was pushed and prodded to look a certain way, act a certain way, have a skinny figure but not too skinny because that wouldn\u2019t be pretty, but if you\u2019re not skinny you will never win. Comparison ran rampant throughout this world and especially among the young girls who did not know any better. Week in and week out, competition after competition my sister was tangibly judged by paid judges on how good she looked, if she fit the mold, and if her dancing ability was good enough. Twelve year old girls were being told that they were not good enough, not skinny enough, not flexible enough, and just plain not good enough by grown adults who were getting paid to do so. I often questioned this toxic culture but accepted it as reality at that young age. In the fall of 2017, we began to notice changes in my sister. She slowly began to stop eating and was hyper focused on how she looked. At first we did not know what to think of this. She was an eighth grade girl so her struggles and insecurities were not abnormal. This trend continued for about a month and my family and I began to seriously worry. From this point on my sister began to take a drastic turn for the worst. She completely stopped eating and refused food. She would do sit-ups in the bathroom when no one was watching until one of us found her. She would sneak in the bathroom and constantly look at her body in the mirror, hating the beautiful girl she saw. She was diagnosed with anorexia in October of 2017. This wreaked havoc on our family. My mom and dad did not know what to do. I had no clue how to process this as an eighth grade boy. Our relatives did not understand the situation at all and dismissed it. Our family was almost ripped apart from the inside out. My sister continued to suffer from anorexia until she reached a breaking point on Christmas Eve that year. She has gone from 125 pounds to 92 in the span of about 3 months. She was also battling severe depression and anxiety and was admitted to the hospital on Christmas Eve. I remember that day as one of the darkest of my life. My family and I were lost and felt helpless, we were heartbroken and distraught. My sister was about a week away from death that day, her vital organs were suffering greatly and had begun to fail. Thankfully, that day is the lowest part of her story. From this point on, she began to heal and recover from her condition. Slowly and steadily, she improved and as a family we worked together to heal collectively. Madison\u2019s story is not a story of defeat and trauma and pain, but a story of victory and strength. A story of triumph and overcoming a dark and painful situation. She still battles with body image issues today but has claimed victory over the war. She is happy and healthy and currently dancing at High Point University, pursuing her passion of dance.\nThe beauty myth is an issue discussed by Naomi Wolf in her writings. She discusses the concept and goes into depth about the issues surrounding this social ideology. The beauty myth is the social concept that women are supposed to look a certain way, act a certain way, and participate in select roles dictated by the power structure that encompasses them. Wolf discusses that the beauty myth and the concept of body images are tools that the institutions of society use to restrict women and keep power over them. By advancing the idea of beauty standards and that all women should look a certain way, act a certain way, and take certain roles, powerful institutions can keep a tight grip on women and keep them in positions where they cannot take their power away. Men also have a strong role I believe in the advancement of the beauty myth. I grew up in a baseball dugout my whole life and grew up around other teenage boys. In my experience, many boys and even grown men I knew and were around discussed women as objects and tools to use for pleasure and as trophies. My teammates and even coaches often discussed women only in sexual terms, making comments about the crude things that would want to do to women and how if some women didn\u2019t fit this specific mold, they were worthless. I have experienced the dangers of this first hand in my life and feel a strong pull as a man myself to change this narrative. Men must take ownership of this problem and have accountability in facing it. The way we discuss women, treat women, date women, and judge women must change and must be done with respect and acknowledgment of the equality and value of women. \nIn conclusion, the beauty myth is a dangerous and harmful ideology that many women sadly battle in modern society. Through social media outlets, entertainment, news, and many other forms of media women are portrayed as objects. Women are held captive to the lie that they have to look a certain way to have value. This lie has very severe consequences and ramifications in society and in the lives of women and young women. Action must be taken to combat this and men must take accountability and ownership of this problem. As a society, we must be good stewards of those who participate in society, and fight for justice, equality, and freedom from the bondage of beauty standards.  \n\n",

        "text": "The Difference Between Gender and Sex and How Social Media Impacts Mental Health\n\n\u00a0When a person feels as though they need to change their gender, it is because they do not feel right in their own body. There is a term for this which is, gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is distress due to a discrepancy between one\u2019s assigned gender and gender identity. Adults who wish to access gender clinics are assessed to ensure they meet the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria. Therefore, the definition of gender dysphoria has a significant impact on the lives of individuals who wish to undergo physical gender transition. (Cooper, 2020) Since there is now more help available for people who struggle with gender dysphoria, we see an increase in people coming out to show who they really want to be. With these gender clinics, it makes it easier for people to help get the treatment for their transition, as well as allow people to find their inner peace. These clinics will allow people with gender dysphoria to have a safe place to talk about their insecurities and get on the right track for any necessary medical help. The clinics also support that some people might need a special place for treatment and realize that their gender is not correct with their sex. Gender diversity is not considered a mental health problem. However, transgender people are more likely to experience mental health problems than the general population. (Cooper, 2020) The clinics are not here to try and change how a person feels in their own body, it is for support. It is there to help a person become who they really feel on the inside and be comfortable in their own body. It is to prevent mental health issues and get their journey to transitioning quicker.\nStereotypes exist all over the internet, especially on social media. One bias is gender stereotyping, which refers to the practice of ascribing to an individual woman or man specific attributes, characteristics, or roles by reason only of her or his membership in the social group of women or men. However, gender stereotyping is a complex process that, although based on strong beliefs of what gender is and should be, is understood too simplistically. (Fosch-Villaronga, 2021) Having these stereotypes all over the internet can cause people to have a closed mind about gender and what the correct definition of gender is. As someone fills in their profile information, you come across, \u201cwhat gender?\u201d and the options are male or female. Fixed into the profile just made will either show more feminine or masculine products to fit that gender. Still, these stereotypes persist online and, as if platforms failed to understand\u2014or deliberately choose to ignore\u2014that gender is not merely being a \u2018man\u2019 or a \u2018woman,\u2019 but a social construct. In the words of De Beauvoir, \u201cone is not born, but rather becomes a woman.\u201d (Fosch-Villaronga, 2021) As people grow and learn their own behaviors and choose the gender they desire and feel so drawn to. Society now has to accept this concept and understand that not everyone feels the same about their sex as they do their gender. Since gender identity is primarily subjective and internal, it also clashes with the idea that gender can be recognized automatically, at least with the state of art gender classification systems (GCS). (Fosch-Villaronga, 2021) If someone is walking around dressed like a girl and using feminine mannerisms, it would be hard to tell if they are that sex and vice versa. Once people figure out that their gender is different from their sex, issues arise because some people still can\u2019t wrap their head around the concept that gender is an internal feeling that someone cannot control.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nSocial media can be a harsh place for bullying, especially for people in the LGBTQ community. People who will express themselves freely may be seen as \u201cabnormal\u201d and not set to the social standard. This can affect the mental health of people within the community but also, with the growth of social media, more support is out there. Research suggests that online settings provide sexual and gender minorities with opportunities for exploration with identity presentation and disclosure that the specific affordance of particular settings shapes the experience and the possibilities for development. In addition, research suggests that the experience of online settings varies across subcommunities of gender and sexual minorities, as some online settings can be spaces in which intra-community stigma is enacted or intra-community tensions exacerbated. (Hammock, 2021) Social media is a source of help but also can be a source of hate since there is always two sides of opinions about gender identity. One side supports it and can understand that gender is not a set thing to a person and the other side would be the ones who cannot understand the concept that gender is internal and think they are just \u201cill.\u201d Once you enter the supportive side of social media, it can create a safe place and become a source of help. People can also create friends that they never would have known without social media. These and other social media platforms created a new social context for interaction and the formation of communities and subcultures. (Hammock, 2021) With the communities and subcultures, a person with no support in their personal life can now obtain some. Finding people struggling with the same problems to talk and be close with will put down the numbers of mental health issues in transgender people and make them feel security and hope again.\nWith all these sources, they all have a common thread among them all. They all support and exchange the idea of gender being an internal feeling that cannot be changed. Dominant social narratives that gender identity and biological sex should align did not fit the transgender person, which resulted in conflict and sadness. This links to the earlier theme of confusion, whereby participants were unsettled by their gender identity not aligning with societal expectations. (Cooper, 2020)\u00a0\u201cSex\u201d\u00a0usually refers to the assigned gender at birth based on medical factors (e.g. genitalia, chromosomes and hormones), usually \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female.\u2019 \u201cGender\u201d\u00a0is both a \u201cperson\u2019s internal, deeply held sense of their gender,\u201d also called\u00a0gender identity. \u2014but is also tied to social, cultural and legal factors. (Fosch-Villaronga, 2021) With regard to gender identity, it is increasingly common to distinguish between\u00a0cisgender\u00a0(i.e., one\u2019s current gender identity matches the sex assigned at birth) and\u00a0transgender\u00a0identities (i.e., one\u2019s current gender identity is different from the sex assigned at birth.) (Hammock, 2021) These definitions from each article will all relate back to the reading from class \u201cDoing Gender\u201d and how West and Zimmerman had explicitly pointed out the two difference in sex and gender. Pointing these out in each section can support the claim that gender and sex are two very different things and gender can be interchangeable. With people being able to express themselves freely it shows other people that they can too. They can also share their stories through social media to support anyone struggling with coming out and being who they truly wish to be.\u00a0\u00a0\nSocial media in the mix of all of this is an important factor to if a person has support and their mental health state. There are many support groups through social media that allow people who have gender identity issues to reach out and gain information and support. Social media is also a huge platform that can support transgender people and get the word out that it is not merely a mental issue but a disorder that cannot be \u201ccured.\u201d With platforms being able to get out valid information it can help educate people to the issue, not to try and change them, but understand the concept of gender dysphoria and how it impacts someone\u2019s everyday life.\u00a0\nIn West and Zimmerman\u2019s article \u201cDoing Gender\u201d the main purpose was to inform the readers about the differences in sex and gender. They thoroughly showed this through many examples and facts. They explain the theory that gender roles are learned and enacted by observing people through real life and this can also tie back to social media. Just by using social media each day, you see how people act and what certain genders do through these platforms. The females are usually influencers and then you have the males who work out or are doing more of a comedy thing. There is a very distinct line through male and female roles that can be adapted just by going through everyday life. With the increase of social media and younger generations being exposed earlier people can see an increase in the desire to show who they really are. Social media allows people to express themselves freely and while there can be hate and bullying there is a tremendous amount of support throughout all of the platforms including groups and even a hashtag.\u00a0\u00a0\nGender is a trait that can be changed if you feel as though it should be, and social media provides healthy support to anyone second guessing this. This is such a strong topic nowadays because we see that more and more people are coming out and showing who they really feel they are. Without the support of social media, the world may be very different today because not many people would have realized what their feeling is normal, and they should be embracing it and not hiding it. Gender dysphoria is not a mental health issue it is more of a disorder that someone cannot change. Instead of hiding it people should embrace it so that anyone feeling the same way as them can see it and be their true self.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork cited\nCooper, K., Russell, A., Mandy, W., & Butler, C.

Many things in the world are assigned based on people's gender, which is called gender, in many ways in which they are given certain things based on their gender. The roles of certain people, when humans were hunters and gatherers, were determined by the gender they fit into. The men would be the ones that would provide for their families and tribes through a variety of activities, such as hunting and thereby achieving the necessity for them to survive. Women became more independent as time went by, and as such, they became more independent, pushing back against the traditional barriers imposed on women by men. Fighting for the right to vote, the right to work, and being respected and honored just like men, they wanted to be viewed and treated as equal. You can argue that women have always enjoyed this; as you see in historical texts, women have always wished to be regarded not just as objects but as people. Women have always wanted to be valued as people. We need to remember that the stories they would write imagine a world where the only strong women are that they would see as a utopia. Yet, in our world, where we are forcefully dodging gender norms, all of that is merely a distant dream as we can't break away from how we handle gender.\n \tRegarding gender, it means that a specific gender will act in a particular way based on what they can expect. There is no doubt in our minds that when it comes to our everyday lives, regardless of who we are and where we come from, we all judge people based on their appearance. Having done it myself, I can attest that it's something I do repeatedly. Whenever I pass a group of people holding skateboards, I think to myself, well, they must be skateboards, or it might be a guy with a tank top and massive arms; that is what I would assume myself, he is on steroids, and he must be a gym guy; those are the things I would consider myself. There is a sense in which that is almost how doing gender is; we may see a man with a woman and know the man as the more prominent and dominant figure in the relationship, which is almost the way it is. There are also many ways in which men can be viewed in a gender-biased light just as much as women are in many respects. An example of this would be the example I just gave, where the man was viewed as more dominant than the woman in the relationship. In the idea of gendering men, men are seen as people who are emotionless, strong, and masculine. Men in this generation feel that they can never express how they truly feel because people would push them aside for being girly or not genuinely being heard. After all, men are supposed to be strong. \nIn many ways, I have experienced gender firsthand. When I tried to open up to some of my friends, all they did was sit there and make fun of the things that had happened and acted like it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that I was joking, but I wasn\u2019t, and I realized that I could never truly open up to them. The same thing happened with my ex-girlfriend; when I tried to let down my walls and show her the real me, she started to drift apart from me, all she wanted was for me to be the stoic, cold man that would listen to her problems and protect her, and at the time I saw nothing wrong with that. Once she broke up with me, I was left with so many built-up emotions, and I had no idea what to do, so I just pushed them down with the rest because I had no idea what to do since I was supposed to be strong and emotionless. Then one night, I was driving home from a volleyball tournament, and I was listening to a podcast, and for some reason, I started to feel; I had no idea what it was, but it was just so overwhelming, I eventually turned off the podcast and sat there for a couple of seconds in silence while that feeling was swallowing me I couldn\u2019t understand. At that moment, I broke down in tears for the first time in my life. Things from my childhood were brought up, and I realized how sad I indeed was for almost all of my life, but I was told to forget about it and push them down, and from that moment on, I decided never to let myself get to that point ever again. Most men suffer from things like that for their whole lives just because they feel the need to fit the role of a man set by society. \nMy cousin, a lesbian, does not fit the role set by society for women and has faced intense backlash from many people. She is very masculine; she has a substantial amount of muscle. She plays rugby for the Ohio State team and has this big mullet that, in my opinion, looks awesome, but to most people, they feel like she is weird because she does not fit the role and look of a woman. She doesn\u2019t match what society calls the beauty myth. The beauty myth is society\u2019s standers of beauty for women; an example of this is that women need to have the least amount of hair on their bodies as possible, which is why women will shave their legs, their armpits, any part of their bodies that grows hair they will try to either shave it wax it or use a product like Nair to remove it chemically.\nEverything in this world fits into what we call collective consciousness; doing gender is a big thing that feeds into this idea. Collective consciousness is what sociologists define as the shared beliefs between people which work as a force within society. In latent terms, it is the flow of community, the unwritten rule of what everyone believes is right and wrong. Doing gender stems from this idea that a woman should be caring and sweet and fit beauty standards, and men should be brutish and emotionless with the intent to provide. And if you were to go against these gender roles, you would go against the flow of the collective consciousness, which will, in turn, create you into a sort of outcast. There has been a big push in the last couple of years for men and women to leave these toxic roles in the past and treat everyone as equals, yet those who do still are viewed as outcasts for doing so. There are times when I will paint my nails, and people will look at me with disdain for the simple fact that I am a man who likes the look of his nails when they are black. Just as my cousin is an outcast for being a woman with a mullet, this is a world that says it is open to everyone, yet they never said that it would accept everyone for who they indeed are. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105-007\nMay 1, 2022\nReflection Essay\n\tDo you let other people\u2019s opinions affect you? Most people would answer this question by saying \u201cNo, I don\u2019t let other people\u2019s opinions control me\u201d, and most of the time that would be a lie. Growing up you hear multiple people\u2019s opinions from your own families to strangers, but now in the 21st-century social media, brings on even higher expectations from a larger amount of people. With society's expectations women need to be pretty, petite and always need to look presentable. A lot of people would think in current times everyone would be more accepting of diversity, but that is not always the case. Women are still expected to be well dressed and fall into certain standards that males will like. People tend to be judgmental and a lot of the time it will get into your head. This can lead to a lot of overthinking or anxiety in women.\n\tFor as long as I can remember, I was always the tallest girl among my peers. In every elementary school class picture, I was in the middle of the back row because that is where the tallest person goes. Consistently I would hear the same statements over and over again. Oh, what I would do to be your height! You should embrace your height, it is so beautiful!  The reaction from other adults is not the same as what I received from people my age. I would consistently hear negative comments from both boys and girls around my age. When coming from a taller family, you grow fast and always have to get new clothes, so I grew up wearing a lot of oversized clothes and was never a \u201cgirly-girl.\u201d I consistently wore tee shirts and athletic shorts. If I ever wore a dress and had my hair done it was because I was told to by my parents. Girls would \nspeak down on me because I was intimidating and different than them. Boys would do the same because they were insecure. How could a girl be taller than them, right? Society has instilled this expectation that males should be tall and powerful, but if a woman is of the same stature, she\u2019s intimidating and \u201ctoo masculine\u201d. \n\tFrom a young age, a lot of girls are told to be \u201cladylike\u201d and that they should dress to impress. I grew up with a large group of boys my age and we would all physically fight and play sports together. I started playing basketball competitively at a young age. Eventually, I got tired of hearing I was good at the sport, \u201cfor a girl.\u201d Boys my age would tell me that girls should not play basketball, so I started playing volleyball, which is traditionally a girl sport. I let society's standards of females control me and my decisions. \n\tSpecifically, in middle school is when I started realizing people talking about me and eventually started receiving comments to my face. I would receive rude comments about my height and how that made me ugly or less feminine. At this time in school, a new boy moved into my neighborhood and started riding our bus to school. Immediately he was the person all the guys were new friends with. The new boy started a new nickname for me, Sasquatch. He and the other boys then proceeded to laugh and poke fun at me. Many of the people in his friend group started calling me that on top of making jokes about me being a giant. I was young so I would just laugh it off with them but realized later how much it affected my mental health. This led to all the little comments swarming around in my head constantly. I started feeling insecure in my body and did not put myself out there as much. I started slouching over a lot to make myself feel shorter because I was not comfortable in my own height. The feeling of this teasing-induced anxiety was always in my body and on my mind. I started to believe that I was not enough because of a few characteristics that were not feminine enough for others in society, one of those being genetically tall. I started seeing myself how others did and slowly started to change myself to society's standards of women. \nCandace West and Don H. Zimmerman wrote a paper on \u201cDoing Gender\u201d. They explained how certain characteristics and activities tend to identify with a certain gender. For example, being tall, powerful, participating in sports, and having short hair is more masculine. On the other side being beautiful, petite, dressing up, and having long hair is more feminine. When one is doing gender, they are behaving the way society expects them to, like others with the same external features and gender. When one has female features, they try to act like their mom, sister or the person raising them of the same sex. They start wanting to wear the same makeup and clothing as their adult counterpart does. \n\tNaomi Wolf talks about the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d and how women are controlled. Men control the beauty myth, by using a standard of beauty to stop women from advancing in careers and other parts of life. If a woman fits a specific set of beauty standards, she is called dumb because one cannot be pretty and smart. A women\u2019s job in society's rules is to marry a man and take care of their kids while the man works for money. Wolf talks about how women fear each other because of their different qualities, this makes them self-conscious. They eventually get stuck in a cycle of trying to be what a man wants.  \n\tThe concept of \u201cThe Looking-Glass Self\u201d was explained by Charles Cooley. He explains that it is how one sees themselves when looking in a so-called mirror. When looking at oneself they do not just see themselves based on their own opinion. The looking-glass self is how you see yourself with all the outside opinions about you. Outsiders\u2019 opinions affect how they see themselves and eventually will affect how they act and stuff they do.\n\tWhen I was younger, I did not follow the female standards of \u201cdoing gender.\u201d I would keep my hair short, play competitive sports, and would wear colors and shirts that were sold for males. I did not feed into the expectations that women were held to. Women are supposed to be emotional and depend on men. While men are strong, emotionless, and a protector of others. As a kid, I did not want boys in my class to help me with things because I could do it myself.  When I would wear clothes meant for boys and keep my hair short, it did not make me any less feminine. In school, teachers would ask frequently \u201cDo we have any big strong boys that want to help move stuff?\u201d. This was inadvertently teaching young girls that they couldn\u2019t be strong enough to help move a desk, or whatever it may be. I was always the biggest in my class, so this question made me think because of my gender I could not complete a simple task. I was still a girl and little characteristics should not have affected how I was treated. \nWhen Wolf wrote about the beauty myth, she said that the men controlled its expectations of it. This causes women to compete in trying to earn acceptance. This results in women talking down to one another, trying to be prettier than each other. That should not be the case, however, women should be building each other up. In personal experience, other girls would try to pick on little things about me so they would get more attention than me from a boy. They did not like how I was close with the boys I grew up with, a lot of them would talk poorly of me.\n\tThe looking-glass self that Cooley talks about is a big thing in our world today. When people bully someone or talk bad about them it gets in that person's head. Eventually, it leads to that person seeing themselves how those other people see them. Personally, people talking about how I was too tall and did not wear cute clothes got to me. I started seeing myself as an outcast and did not believe that any of my friends liked me. I felt unlovable with all the comments made about me. Consistently I talked down to myself, I started to slouch to be shorter, which then turned into me doing heavy makeup, then finally changing my personality and style. People\u2019s opinions clouded my mind and I started to believe they were right about me. My personal looking glass self was textbook defined, I did let outsiders define how I saw myself.\n\tWomen are disproportionately affected by \u201cdoing gender\u201d and the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d which eventually turns into their looking glass self. Society\u2019s standards for women get into their heads, making them change for the outside perspectives. As I grew up the standards started affecting me more and no one should feel like they need to change who they are because of other people\u2019s opinions. Women should start building each other up instead of tearing each other down. In today\u2019s day and age, everyone should be able to do what they want without standards for a certain gender affecting their actions. When a girl is tall, competitive, and likes playing sports it does not make them any less of a female. The multiple times I was told being tall made me less pretty should not happen. Everyone is biologically different, and no beauty myth should affect how one feels about themselves. \n\t\n\n\n",

        "text": "Essay Brief 9\n\n\tIn \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d, Noah explains this with an example of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook. Human groups will traditionally have conflicts and disagreeing opinions based on every individual\u2019s specific thoughts and feelings towards a subject. As humans we also have certain social groups that form out of unconscious thinking because that is how humans brain function and work. Human social groups are based on what is currently happening or what we make of it. It is defined by changes more than continuity. A quote from the text that can explain this would be, \u201cNo matter what revolutions they experience, they can usually weave old and new into a single yarn\u201d (Noah 63) (PDF Version). This can describe civilization today because we rely on old and new ideas and opinions to create societal groups and work as one society, like yarn in a blanket, even though we are divided. \n\tThis concept can heavily relate to Mead\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Self, the I, and the Me\u201d. Within his writing he connects the collective consciousness to individualism and the self is a single entity living a in a world with other bodies. Humans communicate with different behaviors, expressions, emotions, and languages that it is universally indicated that humans have different opinions and are divided into different social groups within society. An individual experiences themselves indirectly through the expressions of others, because humans cannot see themselves as they interact in society. Communication is a big part in this because that behavior introduces the self into the world. A quote from the text that explains this idea about communication would be, \u201cThe unity and structure of the complete self reflects the unity and structure of the social process as a whole; and each of the elementary selves of which it is composed reflects the unity..., implicated\u201d (Mead 165). This explains the concept of communication because we are all united through communication and agreeance in society. We are composed of our own ideas and beliefs which all blend together to develop societal views and opinions as whole. \nConnecting this to civilization, each human on earth has different thoughts and feelings, as well as we are all individual selves living in a world of communication and rapid developing cultures and societies within one whole. Unity plays a big part in this as well because we all have duties as an individual in the world, living each on our own. This relates to our thoughts and feelings and that are opinions are mainly based on experiences. This is why humans naturally form societal groups that make up one society, because as humans, we cannot agree on one thing or concept of ideas. ",

In \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d By Peggy McIntosh, it explains the ideas of all kinds of privileges seen in society and how it is not taught but rather learned and developed within the brain. A quote from the text explains, \u201cI have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets, which I can count on cashing in each day\u201d (McIntosh 1). This quote can further the ideas that the collective consciousness is connected to white privilege because the collective consciousness is seen as invisible and specific beliefs, sentiments, or values someone holds or a social group has. White privilege is a belief in some and not a belief in others, which makes the issue stand out because there is a disagree within society. This is caused by collective consciousness because everyone chooses what to believe based on their way of thinking, interacting, and humans developed a pattern. \n\n\tThroughout the text, McIntosh further explains white privilege by setting up an argument that lists everything she can do as a white woman that her African American friends and coworkers can not do in the day to day. Using the word privilege in this since applies dominance and a pattern is visible within the list that she constructed. Collective consciousness then ties into this because of beliefs and morals of humans. Humans are free to think their minds of what they believe, because that our thoughts and opinions. ",

        "text": "Power and class in America have always shaped the social, political, and economic parts of the nation. It also has caused significant problems throughout the nation like political influence, economic disparities, and educational inequalities. This essay will explore the origins, effects on society, and challenges associated with reaching equality for everyone. \nThe roots of the power and class dynamics in America can be traced back for a very long time. The institution of slavery which happened for years laid a foundation for racial distributions and systematic oppressions in America that even shape the nation to this day. Both power and class share pretty similar relationships but power is defined as the ability to influence or control others, class splits hierarchical divisions within society based factors like wealth and education. Even after the abolition of slavery, some discriminatory laws like the Jim Crow Laws and redlining maintain racial disparities in wealth, education and opportunity. Amidst this, America's foundation relies on equality, its economic structure, and also free market principles. In America, people seek to own property, earn high incomes, and be very wealthy. All of these values are unequally distributed and may be all used as a power indicator. While the idea of capitalism promises equal opportunity and progress, it very often fails to meet these ideas because of top figures of society. Many higher class individuals, corporate executives, and people with higher salaries shape the public discourse and they determine the distribution of resources. Conversely, the working class and lower middle class and lower class communities face things like economic insecurity, limited access to resources, and sometimes poverty.\nIn addition, the center of power and class usually extends to the political realm where individuals and special groups have a large influence due to campaign contributions, sponsors, and corporate interests. The money in politics has become far more beneficial to the wealthy underachieving some principles that America has stood for and often amplifies the voices and opinions of the lower class and less fortunate communities. \u201cThe Rich\u201d are into a social upper class that has developed institutions by which the children of the rich are also put into that upper class world view. The dominance of some cultural norms and values also intersects with power and class in America because mainstream media, entertainment industries, and educational institutions play a huge role in shaping public perceptions, reinforcing stereotypes, and perpetuating social hierarchies. \nA real world scenario between these would be at a prestigious university, where power and class are a very relevant thing, the administrators and staff have significant influence over most campus policies, academic programs, and resources. They come from very privileged backgrounds and have many connections which give many opportunities and it shapes the university's reputation. Within the campus there are students who also have the same benefits through generational money or have family connections who got them into this prestigious school will one day have a great chance at being successful one day through prestigious internships, and networking through other alumni. Meanwhile, the middle and lower class students at most college campuses may face many problems with paying for college, private tutors, and networking to find jobs once they graduate. This is an example of the power and social class benefits that many Americans have over the others.  This illustrates how power and class intersect with many things that go on in today's world, shaping people's experiences and opportunities.\nAs a result of these inequalities in educational experiences, and life connections, ultimately, acquiring high level jobs and earning high income salaries becomes an obstacle for those less fortunate. This perpetuates the economic divide to provide a more established foundation leading to successful futures between those who have had power and class to influence their lives and those who have not.\nIn conclusion, power and class are very important concepts for understanding societal structures and many dynamics. These dynamics are not solely determined by economic capital but are also shaped from factors like race, gender, and ethnicity Furthermore, by acknowledging these issues between social classes and power, we can strive towards a more equal social change.",

        "text": "Final Paper \u2013 Alexis Price \nPicture that from the time you are born, your worth in society is already determined. Throughout elementary and middle school, you are catcalled on the street by men who are ten times your age. Your mom tells you that boys push you and tease you because they like you. When you enter high school, you are pulled out of the classroom because your shirt exposed your shoulders and that would distract the male students. Your male teacher has wandering eyes because he is trying to \u201cprotect\u201d you. When you enter college, you have a 1 in 6 chance of being sexually assaulted. Once you graduate from your university, you finally have your first real job in the big world. You find out that your male coworker is making three times what you are, and he doesn\u2019t even have a college degree. You find the man of your dreams, and everything is going well. You get married and have your first child, and it is a dream until everyone tells you that you should quit your job that you have worked so hard for to become a full-time stay at home parent, while your husband supports the family. After you have your second child, your mother-in-law tells you that you should probably start working out to get rid of that \u201cbaby weight\u201d. Every night, you are critiqued by your husband when he gets home from work because there are dishes in the sink and dinner is not ready. When you are sixty years old, you find out your husband, who you have sacrificed so much for, is having an affair because you are no longer \u201cattractive\u201d in his eyes. You want to make it work but he runs off with a woman twenty years your junior. Your children are grown and now families. You see your child going through a similar cycle that you once fought to break. For many women, this is a reality. Sociology provides multiple theories that help explain and narrate why women experience one or multiple of these scenarios throughout their lifetimes, and why women have always been perceived as \u201cother\u201d.\n\t\n\tGrowing up, I considered myself to be a \u201ctomboy\u201d. I wore my brothers\u2019 clothing, never put time into doing my hair, opted out of painting my nails, and did not pick up mascara until I was sixteen. I never understood why my grandmother would badger me about my appearance and ask me if I had done my hair that morning. By the time I was a sophomore in high school, I had switched out leggings for jeans, bought shirts that were tighter, and straightened my hair every morning. While I was unaware at the time, I was falling into specified gender roles. After my braces came off and I lost a few pounds, boys started to notice and give me attention. I was never used to that, and I became comforted with the gratification from them. I thought that as long as men found me attractive, I would be successful. As I was beginning to think I was comfortable with my appearance, my body dysmorphia skyrocketed as a result of the constant feeling I had to be at a certain weight, with a certain face-shape and body that boys wanted. I was no longer putting effort into my appearance for myself, but to seem attractive to males. While I still find myself doing some of those same things, I am more aware of the fact that I am choosing to be comfortable rather than trying to seem appealing to men.\n\tAmerican culture has monetized on attractive women, using them in advertisements to sell alcoholic beverages and fast-food specials. Music videos almost always display what society has deemed as an \u201cattractive woman,\u201d with minimal clothing, an attractive hairstyle, and makeup done to draw in attention to the song, which in turn leads to more people viewing the video. Video games almost always portray female characters as having small waists, a large bust, and big, puppy dog eyes. It is quite unlikely to find an American film, video game, or music video that does not include a woman who is half-clothed with attractive features.\n\tIt is important to know the difference between sex and gender. Sex is assigned at birth, as male or female, by the genitalia of the baby. Gender is a set of behaviors that is learned socially and associated with the assignment of sex. For example, women tend to have longer hair, while men have shorter hair. Women wear skirts or dresses, while men typically wear pants. \n\tSimone de Beauvoir explains women as other. She says that the category of other is as original as consciousness itself. No group has ever defined itself as the One without setting an opposite group as the Other. Man thinks of himself without woman, but woman does not think about herself without man. Women are nothing other than what men decide; thus, giving women the label \u201cthe sex\u201d which ultimately means that men see women as a sexed being. Man is the subject and the absolute, and woman is the Other. De Beauvoir explains that there have always been women, as far back as history can trace, and women have always been subordinate to men. Women\u2019s dependence has never been a consequence of an event, it just was. \n\tGoffman provided a definition for the action of doing gender between girls, boy, women, and men. It is creating differences between those four categories, which are not natural, biological, or essential. Goffman also elaborates on \u201crole conflict\u201d, which occurs when a person of a particular sex can see clearly that they are out of place, and if they were not there, the current troubles they are facing would not exist. The example provided is a female physician, who is respected for her skill and addressed with the appropriate title of her qualification, but is still subjected to evaluation based on normative conceptions of appropriate attitudes and activities based on her sex category. The female physician\u2019s sex category is used to discredit her participation in vital activities and her involvement in medicine is used to dishonor her commitments as a wife and mother. \n\tCahill looks at the experiences of preschool children that were recruited into normally gendered identities. He argues that children are primarily concerned with being known as socially competent, which in turn leads them to claims of gender identities. Eventually, little boys appropriate the gender ideals of physical strength, while little girls begin to value appearance by managing themselves as ornamental objects. Through this, these children learn that the use of sex categorization is mandatory rather than optional. The act of \u201cdoing gender\u201d is unavoidable because of the social consequences. If doing gender is done properly, we sustain, reproduce, and render the institutional arrangements that are based on sex category. \n\tPerhaps, if we were aware at a younger age that our gender would set us on a certain path in life, whether that means we become successful or our abilities are undermined, it could change the course for how a little girl views herself and grows into a woman. Had I been aware that I was not \u201cdifferent\u201d, but rather fitting into the societal standards of a woman, I may have accepted my preferences and not changed myself for the appeal of others. De Beauvoir explains how women became inferior to men. Goffman and Cahill are only few of many sociologists that have studied why genders perform certain actions in order to establish themselves. But now, some men now wear skirts and high heels, with elaborate make-up and hair. Women no longer feel the pressure to have long hair or dress in skirts. Sociologists have provided various theories and explanations as to why each gender falls into their own stereotypes, but as time goes on, and society moves forward, each group pushes these boundaries and gives sociologists new perspectives to understand and explain.\n\n\n\t",

        "text": "SOC-105-001\n\n\tGender Norms Through the Lens of Social Media\n\nWhy are most humans, who have access, compelled to share on social networks private information about themselves and why do they take others' information seriously? More importantly, why is it that members of social media sites internalize that which they do take seriously? Since its inception, social networking has amassed an exponentially increasing amount of active users who post, share, like, dislike, and comment about the small and large details and events in their and others\u2019 lives. There are numerous platforms on which you can perform these functions. The one\u2019s I will be discussing are Reddit, a platform which hosts communities that focus on particular topics for discussion and Instagram, which is less chat based and more for sharing pictures and videos. However, none of these sites are immune to the growing problem that has developed simultaneously with their popularity surge. The advantages of this new medium are apparent, you can remain in contact with distant relatives and friends, and find new friends who share your interests. While this new mode of online communication has spurred a new wave of global connectivity, by the same token, it created negative social cosnequences. These consequences are an integral part of the growing problem which is not solely inherent to the social media sites but is inherent to human interactions in society, something which the site reflects hyperbollically. In short, social media is a mirror that reflects how we interact with one another and the term hyperbolic represents the conflated fictitiousness that accompanies these reflections. While it serves as a window into our sociology, it also reflects the malignant social stereotypes that plague our society, make up our social customs, and permeate through our institutions. Social networking platforms hyperbolic reflection of our everyday interactions reinforces social stereotypes particularly where it pertains to gender in the offline world. \nAn incorretable flaw in the design of social media is that everyone is posting the highlights of their days, weeks or even months, which people erroneously assume to be their everyday life. If users' posts are devoid of the mundaness of life and viewers are incapable of realizing the difference between fact and fiction. They inevitably feel worse about themselves and may be compelled to fake their posts, the hyperbolic aspect, to communicate a sense of perfection in their lives as a way of competing against others. Posters do this to achieve validation and claim illusory feelings of happiness. To successfully compete against others in having the best, happiest, and most interesting lives installs them higher in the echelons of the social hierarchy. The method by which posters of this nature swear, collides with the satisfaction of gender norms and stereotypes. Likely, the reason for this is that the stereotypes are understandable, they are a cookie-cutter view of how a person should act and behave according to their gender. If these gender stereotypes embody the chracteriestic of a perfect human, fulfilling these standards provides posters with the simplest way to demonstrate perfection in their lives.\n Erving Goffman, proposed that when we are born we are propelled onto a stage called life and our social interactions are formed by learning to play our roles from other people. When in the company of others we perform our role and they perform theirs for us too. I believe this concept supports my assertions regarding the reasons people post, take posts seriously, and box themselves into gender norms as a way to compete in the hirearchy. When one first creates their social media account it is akin to being born, as stated in the concept. The immediate online socialization begins to force the new user into a singular way of thinking, that being life demands perfection. Subsequently, they learn to replicate what is most common, the submission to gender norms as a means to propagate perfection. During this period is also when the user will have adequately prepared themselves to perform their role on the front stage. They post their content in competition with others and when finished they return to the back stage where reality sets in and they can step out of character. Context is important with Goffman\u2019s stage theory, someone who socializes online will adapt their role differently than if they are socializing in person. Socializing for the poster is a context where reality is obscure and relative but for the offline communicator the personal connection mostly overcomes the online demand for perfection and submission to gender norms. This is an immutable facet of social networking, the design of these sites inadvertantly promotes competition between posters, which in turn demands their conformity to baseline standards which are socially desirable. It affects members of both genders and leads to the reinforcement of gender norms which supports gender inequaliy in society.\nSocial networks provide users with a social landscape wherein people can express themselves, their opinions, and feelings, likes, and dislikes. Self expression can be rewarding in that one can find a like minded person or crowd of people but by the same token it can invite criticism, harassment, or bullying. Such is the same in real life too, however an online setting concentrates its content for the user, you see what you want, unlike real life where what happens is largely arbitrary. Reddit for example has content partitioned into communities but they are largely dominated by gender affiliation. Reddit does not offer a diverse place to interact should you be interested in a topic which falls outside that which you would socially be expected to like based on gender. Statistically speaking, the communities with the highest percentage of female paticitpants are those that partake in quintessentially female things; Reddit reports that the most popular are  makeup and fashion. Meanwhile, communities revolving around topics such as sports and video games have the highest percentage of male participants. This could be explained by a phenomenon whereby people group each other based on gender instead of topic or interest.  Which is supported by the argument that the collective conscious furnishes our sense of self with a role to play according to our biological sex. Meaning, males will flock to tradionally masculine acitivities while females flock to feminine activities because their role requires it. Interestingly, topic categorization is further divided by gender using labels. Instead of there being a collective science community there is a subset for females interested in science, likewise, there is a female gamers subset instead of one for just gamers. \nThe nature of this labeling implies that the female domain is considered less than the male domain and that their interests must function depending on gender. It is as if there is an unspoken social rule where women should not join these communities because they are women. This concept of women being subordinate to males is reminiscent of the Woman as Other text by Simone Beauvoir. Beauvoir states that women are \u201cother\u201d because they live relative to men in society. There is not science but female science because they are the \u201csecond sex\u201d and embody what men do not have. Member participation by gender in reddit communitites largly parallels real life gender norms. Males and females are segregated into their own communities based on gender stereotypes, which hinders diversity by and reinfroces exsiting notions of gender roles.\nApart from Reddit, which is primarily chat based, sites exist to share pictures and vidoes about yourself and your daily activities. Instagram, being one such site, allows users to share images of themselves. Many female users feel a societal pressure to doctor the images they post of themseleves in accordance with female standards of beauty. Apparently, 90% of young women in a recent study, reported using a filter or editing the physical appearance of themselves before posting their photo. Furthermore, the women in the study also reported that they regularly saw advertisements for cosmetic products or procedures to enhance their physical appearance. This data corroborates Naomi Wolf's concept of the beauty myth, which argues that women are pressured to conform to unrealistic beauty standards that results in them adopting unhealthy behaviors like a preoccupation with appearance. \nWolf\u2019s beauty myth highlights the foundation on which many men view women and they view themselves. As well as fuel for the unfortunate cycle of  young women getting exposed to advertisements which use beauty as a selling point, internalizing what they see and continuing to doctor their images, allowing cosmetic companies to take advantage of them. This feedback loop, as it is, powers the worsening mental health that can be observed in the younger generations that use social media by solidifying gender specific stereotypes. \nRoles for humans to play according to their gender have existed for millenia and have adapted with time to the changing circumstances. In today\u2019s world social media can be used as a tool to further understand the way gender norms impact our social interactions and way of thinking by peering into the fabric of our online interactions. It\u2019s reflection of certain aspects of our sociology allows us necessary insight into the way social norms persist in society. Social media platforms like Reddit, passively enforce gender norms via the disparity in community statistics. Members organize themselves based on gender and not interests which yields undiverse and biased communities. Instagram, on the other hand, falls prey to the same architecture that runs networks, promoting conformity to gender norms through competion in a social hierarchy as a means to propagate a perfect online lifestyle. The architecture allows instagram advertisers to sell a lifestyle to vulnerable young women, which forces them to adhere to the beauty myth and down an unhealthy cycle of obsessing over their physical appearance. Since it forms the foundation upon which social networks are built, the architecture will continue to promote competition by hyperbollically reflecting our interactions and that inspires posters to conflate their own lives and post their own fictions consistent with the concept of gender norms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nThelwall, Mike, and Emma Stuart. \u201cShe\u2019s Reddit: A Source of Statistically Significant Gendered Interest Information.\u201d 2018.\nhttps://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.08091.pdf\n\n\u201c90% Of Young Women Report Using a Filter or Editing Their Photos before Posting.\u201d ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, 8 Mar. 2021, https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210308111852.htm. \n\nWolf, Naomi.

        "text": "Celia Oxendine\t\u00a0\nSOC 105-006\u00a0\n5/2/22\u00a0\nWhat is the beauty myth and how is it still used?\u00a0\nThe beauty myth has been prevalent for centuries and has been researched for a long time. Where the beauty myth came from has not been acknowledged or studied, due to this, we will probably never have a hypothesis on that. However, we will be discussing how it is still used in society today. We will also discuss how it has affected society throughout the years. Our hope with this essay is to get an in-depth look at the beauty myth and where it stands today. \nBefore we get a perspective into how it has affected society, particularly women in society, we will take this chance to describe the beauty myth. The beauty myth according to our notes, is a societal standard affecting behavior towards women. This societal standard is where a woman is judged by her beauty, therefore, measuring her self-worth. This is also where aging is considered the enemy to this societal standard within the beauty myth. It also undid feminism practices in place at the time. The beauty myth, however, does not have a set time that it had developed even though it has been prevalent for centuries. It has been around for centuries with evolving and changing factors with no real source to the beauty myths origin.\nWhy is it that more women throughout history have been subjected to this beauty myth? I will give the reader a perspective on the women subjected to the beauty myth. According to our notes, these women have experienced pressure to conform to an unrealistic beauty standard deemed beautiful by society. There were also influences all around them through media and backlash against political progress. Society, specifically men, were threatened by more roles being created for women in their community. Socially constructed beauty was on the rise as was consumerism, beauty was seen as a commodity, and women were seen as objects. \nWithin society, there have been many instances of the beauty myth, and much research has been done on the beauty myth. First, we will talk about past research regarding the beauty myth. According to Susan Averett, a journalist with the Journal of Human Science in 1996, they \u201cinvestigate income, marital status, and hourly pay differentials by body mass (kg/m2) in a sample of 23- to 31-year-olds drawn from the 1988 NLSY\u201d. They have used this research to show that \u201cobese women have lower family incomes than women whose weight-for-height is in the \"recommended\" range \u201c. This is an example of how the beauty myth has affected society. It shows the difference that these beauty standards make between the weight classes in our society. The article also shows that \u201cthere is some evidence of labor market discrimination against obese women\u201d. \n\tThis article shows the effect the beauty myth had on teens in the late 80s stating that \u201c Eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa and\u00a0bulimia) is a major social problem in the United States\u201d having estimates such as ranges of \u201c1 to 4 percent of the female population\u201d for anorexia nervosa. There have also been higher estimates for bulimia nervosa \u201cas high as 20 percent of college and high school females\u201d. These implications a hard to ignore as they affect society's youth in extremely difficult ways.\u00a0\nOne of the most frequent post-feminist beauty myths is a social media trend that happened in 2021 that is called \u201cStrong is the new skinny\u201d according to Jessica Maddox with the Feminist Media Studies. According to the article, \u201cgiven postfeminist contradictions, this presents a terrain in which only certain women are even allowed to attempt to achieve the unobtainable body\u201d. This trend gives a new face to the beauty myth and can be just as destructive as the beauty myth that started it all. This social media trend \u201crepackages old body stereotypes in a way befitting the era of postfeminist confidence\u201d. There has been a re-emergence of beauty myths located within social media trends. However, as stated in the article, some of these trends are \u201cworth noting as feminism turns to the fourth wave and emphasizes hashtags-hashtags can turn and remain rhetorical if not critically probed\u201d.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed the beauty myth in this paper, we have gotten a deeper look into how it affects us as a society. Whether it be social media trends, eating disorders, or incomes it can affect us all. It is a societal standard that is prevalent in the past and today that can control how we think about ourselves and how we act in society. It is a long-standing standard that needs to change and can be very detrimental to mental health. Hopefully, in the future the beauty myth will be irrelevant to society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverett, S., and S.
