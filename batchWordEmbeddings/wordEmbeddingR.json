But humanity owes all of our accomplishments to the formation of collective social consciousness and the beginning of social groups and civilizations where the collective consciousness could flourish. But when did these developments start and why?\nLike anything else, all sociological ideas strong bases to hold themselves up. Fligstein and MacAdams call these bases microfoundations. As far as many sociologists can tell, the collective consciousness started to form roughly 50,000 years which were quickly followed by relics from undefined religious practices, such as burial. These two things were fueled by the advancing development of the neocortex in the brain as Maryanski and Turner describe in The Neurology of Religion. Because the collective consciousness is the source of groups in religion, it makes sense that the two developments in humanity coincide in the timeline. Maryanski and Turner make the point that not only was religion created for more practical reasons of helping a group stay together under a great sense being other than their animal themselves but it was created for safety proposes. The world is a very terrifying place and it is that fact as well as other parts to mirofoundations that fueled the need for sets of rules and beliefs.\n  They study of mircofoundations provides a clear light for sociologists to discover more about the psychological and situational events that lead to the development of religion and ancient societies. The fact that the development of mirofoundations was marked with relics that are now recognized as religious, in the broad sense, describes just how much humanity needed to feel like they were in control. All of the societal progress that humanity has witnessed over the past 50,000 years will always be thanks to the development of the collective conscious. \n",

When individuals start to share similar mindsets and express them in an environment it creates a collective conscious which puts pressure on other individuals in that same environment. This is collective conscious and experience within it are prevalent for college students when they are deciding on what fields they want to enter. The environment, daily life, and interest in the field are factors that are all considered and create their own collective conscious within each discipline which will attract similar minded people. Another factor that is not talked about as much is gender, which most noticeably different among the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. This paper looks to explain why a disproportionate number of men enter the STEM fields compared to their female counterpart as a result of the collective conscious, difference in exposure prior to college, and different responses to classes. These factors make it so women wanting to enter a male dominated field become more difficult due to a cycle that has lasted generations.\n\tThe very first topic that was discussed in this sociology class was about the social consciousness and becoming aware of societies form. One author that elaborated on this was Emile Durkheim, who said that the collective conscious was formed from multiple people having the same values and ideas. The collective conscious this society formed could be viewed differently by other societies which means that a society can never be \u201ccorrect\u201d. It also puts a pressure on individuals that exist in it to conform to beliefs or methods practiced which may cause that individual to stray away from their true nature.\n\tThis concept is applicable in the college collective conscious for when people decide which field they wish to spend their life working or researching in, especially in STEM. Getting a degree is seen as a necessity to get a successful future within modern society so more people are inclined to go to college than in previous generations. With the STEM fields being notoriously hard for people, poor grades are bound to happen eventually for the majority of those who choose to go down that path. One area that was studied was the response to failing grades in men compared to women. This study found that women were more likely to change their major from a male dominated STEM field compared to men, who were more inclined to still pursue that same major (Kugler, 2021). They also found that women in male dominated STEM fields were more critical and harsher of their grades which was a big influence for switching majors. The reason for more women switching their major more frequently was denoted to the fact that because it was already male dominated, they might not matchup with the field even if they were to graduate where men did not have this concern. \n\tThe knowledge of the field being male dominated made enough of an impact to dictate decisions on whether to give up, which is completely external of the individual. Just because a person fails an exam or class in their major does not mean that they would be a terrible fit for it as a career. Their value and what they can contribute goes beyond what a test says and should be better elaborated in the STEM fields. These women who change their majors could be seen as falling under the pressure of the modern collective conscious to some extent by choosing to conform to more traditional female fields. Some of these women might have a talent for the field if they were to explore it more, but the collective conscious goes against them their entire journey by telling them they are social deviants. In some instances, they might even be told by their peers that they should leave the male dominated field because a woman has no place in it.\n\tThis trend of male dominated STEM fields can appear strange considering more women attend education institutions past high school. The common factor that most college students have is that they went to high school, which also influences career paths for many. With gender roles and beliefs existing in societies, high schools may limit the exposure of the STEM fields to women compared to men. Things such as clubs and elective classes also influence interests that last long term and can even turn into careers, so gender segregation outside the classroom also adds another reason for why men are pushed further towards STEM fields. Gender segregation starts early in society with kids being told by others what they are supposed to like due to their sex, which pushes them toward a certain direction in the future when they want to explore more options. By the time they reach high school they have been pushed far enough a certain way by parents, peers, and society that all the available options are not considered (Lewgie & DiPrete, 2014).\n\tThis early gender segregation of interests leads genders down a path that the collective conscious tells them is ok for them to be interested and work in, rather than letting the individuality of each person shine through. This pressure that each person faces throughout life alters the individual to fit more of what society wants or expects from them, keeping them trapped in a cyclic collective conscious. Societies are made and structured so that they are not easily changeable because most of the people in it create the rules, and if a person does not follow them then they are socially deviant. While everyone is socially deviant to an extent, there are core values integrated in societies that have harsher punishments compared to others. The punishment in this case would affect social life through school which would then transitions into work life after. \n\tThe other side of this trend in STEM fields falls on the side of the men. Questions may be asked about why they would be drawn to STEM rather than other fields of study. One study done found that men are more naturally inclined to gravitate toward STEM compared to women at all levels of high school math proficiency (Mann & DiPrete, 2013). While both men and women were close among math and science levels in high school, more men chose to enter a STEM field when they got to college partially due to life goals which was surveyed. Another factor to be noted in this study was that on average women had higher verbal and communication skills, which is also another contributor to women branching out more towards non-STEM fields. There are a lot of other reasons why people choose to pursue one major over the other, whether it be what they want their future to look like, money, or even stereotypes about that field. All these factors cannot be monitored and taken into account each study, but correlations can be drawn from quantitative data that is observable.\n\tThe impact the collective conscious played in this study was noticing that women were better at the communication and writing compared to men. If they feel they are good at something other people might not be as good at, they might be more inclined to go towards that direction to help benefit the overall society that the collective conscious puts pressure on. With some of these fields such as education, psychology, and fine arts being female dominated, more women may feel comfortable sticking in these fields and ok with the gender disparities. Having already late to no exposure to non-required classes in high school was also seen across all these studies, and another reason for not wanting to explore these fields due to stereotypes along with them.\n\tThe mindset people have when it comes to picking careers also comes with stereotypes of how people in that society perceive that career. The opinions of those around them also would influence their decisions while in post-secondary education. The collective conscious puts images and beliefs into its society from the experiences of others which generate stereotypes. These stereotypes are not based off fact, but rather opinions that were created and accepted by others to generalize. Stereotypes in the case of gender roles are harmful because they limit a person\u2019s mindset and put forth false information that look to keep traditional values even if they are harmful. The stereotyping in STEM can seem like the fields are gatekept in a way. More men have reportedly wanted to keep the STEM field traditional compared to women who also say there is more injustice done towards them because of their gender (Casta\u00f1o, Lubiano & Garc\u00eda-Izquierdo, 2020). With more women feeling something is wrong with the collective conscious and stereotypes for them, they are considered social deviants as they are in the minority of what the STEM collective conscious views as acceptable. With men setting this collective conscious, they have set the impression and stereotype throughout the rest of society and a larger collective conscious that STEM is for males. \n\tBreaking out of this collective conscious cycle is no easy feat, considering it still exists today just as it has in the past. The society is the one that changes and sets the collective conscious so all generations within it must widely accept it. This change cannot happen overnight but incorporating social deviance slowly would be an effective method that would slowly break apart these stereotypes and lack of exposure in society today. Education in modern society has been pushed more than ever before, so all paths should feel open to those who wish to continue past high school. Asian society however is completely different than American society in the fact that they encourage more people to pursue education in STEM regardless of gender. They also have seen results that research conducted among the same gender is more productive than if the two were opposite genders (Yang & Shen, 2020). This research also mentions the idea that female educators in STEM are seen as role models and encourage the younger female generations to enter STEM fields. This implies that if The United States were to hire more female STEM teachers, that over time more women would enter the field and push future generations to do the same. This would help break the collective conscious that is built in America and be more inviting towards women who might have an interest in STEM but are told that they should not pursue it because of their gender. \n\tThe impact that the collective conscious has is what drives a society whether it be seen as helpful or a hinderance. It wants to punish social deviance and reward conformity towards what is seen as acceptable, and with men deciding the collective conscious among STEM fields it allows them to keep these fields male dominated. As a result of this image women do not get the exposure throughout high school and childhood that men do to the STEM fields, which allows this to continue from generation to generation. This process will continue to exist until stereotypes and beliefs about women in STEM change to be more accepting of them which will in turn allow more exposure at younger ages to consider a STEM career path. With more gender equality and involvement in the STEM there can only be progression in the field as a result, which should not be feared by society. Encouragement should be done for anyone expressing interest in STEM just as it is in China. Breaking gender stereotypes created by the collective conscious must also be destroyed the same way by making this current deviance the accepted for the future. Societies are constantly looking to improve themselves through the lens of the collective conscious and making things deviant, but sometimes what is considered deviant is what is needed to improve.\n\n\n\nReferences\nKugler, A., Tinsley, C., & Ukhaneva, O.

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n28 April 2021\nFinal Sociology Paper - Racism and White Privilege\n\tRacism, Sexism, Homophobia, Ageism, etc.; these issues are and have been incredibly prevalent in society since before recorded history because of the us versus them dynamic, which is one that most people fall into when talking about groups or cultures different from their own. But how do each of these topics relate to each other? And how do societies begin to actively work to fix the damage done by these issues? In predominately white cultures in Europe and North America, the issue of white privilege is currently receiving a lot of attention due to more efforts made to expose and resolve issues of racism in western societies. Numerous studies have been done on racism and white privilege especially in the United States since it currently holds the position of hegemonic power in the world. One of the main difficulties in ending the power these issues have over society is that they are so deeply ingrained in society and government that to tackle one topic, it to have to deal with all of them. The issue addressed today is the presence and effects of racism and white privilege in current western society, how it is currently shaping the future of these cultures, and what has proven effective in changing how issues, like racism, are treated. \n\tWhite privilege: this term is defined as \u201cthe set of social and economic advantages that white people have by virtue of their race in a culture characterized by racial inequality\u201d by the online dictionary and thesaurus Merriam-Webster.com. The concept of white privilege is one that often makes people uncomfortable, mainly white people, and therefore is not an easy topic of conversation. Because white people do not perceive their inherent advantages as such, they do recognize that it affects every single racial and ethnic minority around them in an increasingly negative light. \nOne distinction that should be made is that occasionally when used in discussion, the term white privilege can be confused with the term white supremacist, which is defined by Merriam-Webster.com as \u201ca person who believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races\u201d. While white supremacy in western culture is viewed as the more serious offense against racial and ethnic minorities, white privilege can be seen in almost every facet of western society; governmental institutions, education, housing, social media, etc. With regards to general society, white privilege can be seen in how minorities are treated by authority figures. A most recent example being the recently exposed cases of police brutality in the United States, including the murders of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor\nWhile the United States is often at the forefront of the news when the topic of racism and white privilege comes up, most predominately white cultures still have these issues. Michael J. Mascarenhas talks about the intersection between white privilege, the environment, and racism, in Ontario, Canada in his work Where the Waters Divide: Neoliberal Racism, White Privilege and Environmental Injustice. None of these issues are singular events that can be solved individually, they have been integrated almost completely into each other. Mascarenhas illustrates how racism and environmental injustice go hand in hand through his research into the contemporary type of racism that Canadian and First Nation people are seeing today. He states that this new type of racism \u201cthrives in highly racialized societies that espouse racial equality, but in which whites\u2026 will not tolerate either being inconvenienced in order to achieve racial equality, or be denied the full benefits of their whiteness\u201d. (Mascarenhas, 8). \nIn Mascarenhas\u2019 study, he interviewed twenty-seven First Nation people, including two Chiefs, water treatment plant workers, and community activists. He observed that Each of them faced the same fundamental racism in their everyday lives and when white Canadian citizens felt that their \u201crights\u201d were being threatened by the First Nation people, they used \u201ctwo of the oldest racial stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples\u2014lacking motivation and intelligence \u201cto work to survive.\u201d (Mascarenhas, 11). According to Mascarenhas, the difference between the two groups was that the shortcomings of the First Nation people were due solely to choices of the individual instead of results from a society organized around particular types of racism. \nThe work Everyday Racism\u2019 in a Culture of Political Avoidance: Civil Society, Speech, and Taboo by Nina Eliasoph takes a deeper dive into what racism looks like through the more focused channel of how people talk about racism and race in situations that are not specifically devoted to that topic. Eliasoph looks at the benefits of having race conversations in everyday life and how when people treat these topics with sincerity, but not awkwardness or fear, much more progress in communication can be made. Communication is indeed one aspect of daily life that most people do not understand the power of or how to properly use it. The question of why most white people find it difficult to discuss racism or race during normal social conversation is because most people can be classified as \u201cpassive bystanders\u201d. (Eliasoph, 486). Similar to the situation that occurs when a large group of people see someone be attacked and do nothing because they believe that someone else will do something, passive \u201cbystanders notice the action and do not actively support it but do not do anything to oppose it, either.\u201d (Eliasoph, 486). \nIn the conclusion of Eliasoph\u2019s work, she broke down how each of the categories discussed in her work, beliefs, social structures, and conversation, were observed to either encourage or limit open dialogue about race. While personal beliefs did not impact the conversation as much as anticipated, the concept of polite conversation did inhibit people from speaking freely about racism. Eliasoph noted that when social structures, like school/education, asked people to not speak on their thoughts of race but rather question the types of speech surrounding racial topics that the conversation flowed much more freely and the thoughts were then uncovered with less resistance. The last topic Eliasoph tackled is the global side of the discussion. Since racism is so ingrained into every society and culture in one way or the other, talking about it also involves talking about many other issues in the world including sexism, homophobia, ableism, sex trafficking, the drug trade, police brutality, etc. and when people are uncomfortable talking able one, they will be uncomfortable talking about any of these topics. \nColor-Blind Racial Attitudes: Microaggressions in the Context of Racism and White Privilege by Jared Edwards tackles the issue of microaggressions. The term microaggression is used to describe \u201ca comment or action that subtly and often unconsciously or unintentionally express a prejudiced attitude toward a member of a marginalized group (such as a racial minority)\u201d. Edwards talks about the historical context of racism in the United States, beginning with the slave trade that took place predominately in the southeast of the country. Though the true history of overt racism began with the early colonizers and the continual slaughter of the Native Americans, most history books lead the race discussion with the peak of slavery after the revolutionary war. But, in continuation, Edwards also mentions the Internment camps used during World War Two for the mass imprisonment of Asian American people due to the discrimination and distrust of Asian people. \nIn the conclusion of Edwards\u2019 argument, he talks about how every culture, group, society, etc. is unique and if we try to ignore or wash over this fact, we will face our own downfall. The experience that each group and more specifically each individual has in life will be different than anyone or other group could experience. \u201cHowever, when we choose to truly explore our differences and really see others with their identities and experiences intact, then we can move toward true acceptance and valuation of diversity.\u201d (Edwards, 15). \nThe concept of true and complete acceptance of all differences while comforting on some levels is realistically impossible, and Edwards does address this unnamed concept of a utopia. This statement is backed through Color-Blind Racial Attitudes, otherwise referenced as CoBRAs, which Edwards defines as \u201cthe values expressed by those who claim to see all people as the same without acknowledging, or even noticing, racial identity\u201d (Edwards, 12). However, CoBRAs and white privilege meet at an interesting point, because if people are completely blind to the differences of the minority groups around them, whether racial, sexual, or gender groups, then they hold to the same bases of the concept of white privilege; They will not be able to recognize the disadvantages that the other groups face and the challenges that they have to overcome. Like any controversial matter, education and honest discussion are the most effective tools for changing our perspectives. \nIn conclusion, while western culture has made great pushes towards racial and gender equality in recent years through the activism and work of the people in these cultures, there are millions of more steps to take forward. None of these issues are new, but all are extremely important for every person to be educated in. Like the discussions of racism mentioned at the beginning of this essay, discussion about differences between different individuals or groups is not a comfortable one. Problems including white privilege and white supremacy are so securely rooted in the culture and society of the United States that to undermine these structures would be to destabilize the foundation of western social order. The reality of racism and sexism is that they are so ingrained into the world, that in order to wholly disassemble them, there will have to be a complete restructuring of every government and social concept. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nEdwards, Jared. \u201cColor-Blind Racial Attitudes: Microaggressions in the Context of Racism and White Privilege.\u201d Administrative Issues Journal, vol. 7, no. 1, 2017, pp. 5\u201318., doi:10.5929/2017.7.1.3.

        "text": "5053\nThe Power Elite Perpetuates White Privilege \n\n\tThe \u201cpower elite\u201d makes up only a small percentage of the U.S. population. It is the rich socialites, Corporate executives, and prominent think tank members. These few people control a majority of all decisions made by political leaders. They use their money and influence to control the classes below them. Political leaders are not included in this \u201cpower elite,\u201d as they are the main ones asking these elites for support for their campaigns. This makes them borderline puppets that the \u201cpower elite\u201d use to push their agenda. \n\tWhite privilege is a system developed in the United States as a means of justifying slavery and discrimination. It is extremely subtle in the ways it supports white people over other racial groups. Some examples of white privilege would be a white man being more likely to get a job over a minority or white people being put in \u201cnicer\u201d neighborhoods than other minorities. These practices further segregate races while giving white people an unfair advantage in life. \n\tSome argue that it is on the part of white people themselves to tear down the workings of white privilege. Others contest that it is not their fault for being born white. Therefore, they have no obligation to fight that agenda. Looking to the power elite for an answer in this contest leads one to believe that they are the ones controlling it. A majority of the power elite consists of white men. The very people that white privilege serves are the ones with the most power to end it. The power elite controls all the policies that systematically promote white privilege. \n\tBoth these concepts share the promotion of people based mainly on birth right rather than by working for their spot. In the case of the \u201cpower elite\u201d nepotism is a huge factor in who is in the \u201cin\u201d group and who is out. If someone is the child of a wealthy pharmaceutical CEO, odds are they will be invited to the same social events as his father when he hits the right age. This helps to condition their brain to promote the same culture for themself when they inevitably take control of their family's estate. It\u2019s all about building up the foundation that protects themselves. When it comes to white privilege, it is a lot broader who is in the \u201cin\u201d group and who is out. Every white person in America is in the \u201cin\u201d group. Being born white is not nearly as exclusive as being born into money, but there are still a good amount of benefits that come with it. There is also the opportunity for motivation to keep the system in place. So, there is very clearly the process of elite white people to keep both systems in place to secure their high standings in the world. They do this by first protecting their position as elites, then using that power to keep white privilege as a system in place. \n\tIn comparison, white privilege is a much less direct process than holding power as the \u201cpower elite\u201d is. Gaining and perpetuating white privilege is a very subconscious process. It can be summed up as being born white and reaping the benefits. The main workings of white privilege are just general prejudices deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of the general population. Gaining and perpetuating the process as a \u201cpower elite\u201d involves a lot of careful planning and luck. The lucky part is being born into the position and the careful planning is the lobbying you do to political leaders to keep yourself safe. \n\tReal life examples of both these concepts can be found in high level office jobs across America. The diversity levels of high level jobs across America are so low that there are actual laws in place to try and even out the graph. This shows how white privilege perpetuates an advantageous life situation for white people. Some can argue that white people work for, and earn that spot. Even so, they have lives that are systematically designed for them to make it to the top. The \u201cpower elite\u201d live for these high ranking office positions. These are not jobs like receptionists or printers. These are the board directors who sit for the boards of multiple different companies just to ensure the success of them all. \n\tThese two concepts are important to one another to stay afloat. White privilege gives the \u201cpower elite\u201d a safety net to keep themselves in positions of power. While the \u201cpower elite\u201d manage policies to maintain their own position and the systematic reproduction of white privilege. To tear down this horrible accumulation of power it takes white people to recognize their own privilege and for people to recognize where the power in our country is actually located. People need to bond together to tear down the \u201cpower elite\u201d currently dictating our lives.\n\t\n\t",

        "text": "Graded Essay 4\n\tSince the dawn of humanity and the civilizations that they built, there has been inequality between groups. These inequalities were split down many social lines like gender identity, sexuality, ethnicity, etc. but one of the most common and still existing inequalities that humanity faces today is the effects of income inequality. In western society, income is equal to power and social standing, therefore whoever has the most money has the most influence in society. But, the role of technology is the fate deciding factor in how social standing and inequality affect humanity in the future.\nIn conclusion, since the 1% of society are almost in control of western civilization through their financial gains, it would be easy for them to monopolize the rest of society by buying out the technology companies that they do not already own in order to control the personal data that everyone else willing submits to these companies. In the opinion of Harari, the only way to prevent this from happening is through the regulation of data ownership. The best way to move forward with that plan is to educate the populous and use the power posses by the majority to stop the 1% from completely controlling their lives.\n\t",

        "text": "Mantsios states in the very beginning of his work that people do not like to talk about social classes, at least they do not like the connotations that come with some of the terms about their class. But, when a new name or more \u201cgentle\u201d term is applied to the group, everyone is more willing to talk. On the other hand, people are coming to recognize that the title of one\u2019s class, whether it is economic or gender specific etc., they are no indicative of a person\u2019s inherent worth. This idea is most definitely not new, but something that must be reintroduced to each generation. In continuation, the basic summary of Domhoff\u2019s piece is that power and financial prowess will always go hand in hand. While this statement is true in many aspects of contemporary American society, the physical obtainment of money is not longer what people want to see. Society is beginning to judge those by not if they have money, but what they do with it. The truth is that people are seeing that bad people with a lot of money but no support are not going to get very far. Money is an arbitrary thing, and once the collective decides that a certain person\u2019s wealth, no matter how much, is going worth respect, the finances lose all grounds.  \nIn regards to both of the readings, nothing is as simple as society likes to believe. One can poses an exorbitant amount of money, but if they do not command the respect of their peers and society, they hold very little power. The classes that people are defined away into continually change but each new generation must come to their own understanding of that these classes actually mean and what their generational relationship with intrinsic value is going to be. Yes, both reading make excellent points, but society is a living organism that will always change and adapt to the surrounding influences. ",

It is a fundamental need to feel like we belong and have intimate relationships with others. With the emergence of social media, you can be connected with thousands of others at a click of a button. This might sound like a useful tool, but it has its consequences.\n\tYou would think in a world with social media we would feel more connected, but this is not the case. It has actually done the opposite; people feel more alienated than ever. This is because hundreds of online friends cannot provide you with the same feeling of belonging as a small intimate offline group can. We are becoming more disconnected by using social media as the main way to communicate and interact with each other. In order for us to feel like we belong it has to stem from the offline world. The body and self, interact and affect each other. To take away physical sense and the body from social interaction plays part in why online relationships are not able to provide you with the same feelings.\n\tSocial media is a slippery slope. If we want to create meaningful relationships and feel like we belong we have to stray away from social media. People don\u2019t realize the drastic affect social media can have our sense of self and should be educated on it.",

Not so much. If asked why the United States was involved in World War Two, the answer would be simple, to fight the Nazis; but if asked why the United States is fighting Iraq, most Americans would draw a blank. In chapter eleven of 21 Lessons For The 21st century, Harari depicts how much war and its reasons have changed over the years; much like the concept of rationalization which driven humans away from their roots.\n\tAccording to Harari, wars used to make sense politically; the United States fought Mexico for land, Japan grew more powerful as it fought China and Russia, and Britain became the Earth\u2019s top empire through tiny wars all across the planet. These wars were successful, they had purpose, the United States grew by over 2.3 million square kilometers. This has changed though, wars in the Middle East are not successful and there are no clear winners or a purpose. As society grew and we modernized what had meaning, we also modernized war. Much like mostly everything in society, war has become a commodity; it has lost its meaning and purpose and now serves capitalism. Back in the premodern age, the only money you made was through the land you captured, but now its through profits on guns, machinery, and instruments used to cause more war; no one wins this way, war just continues. Just as society has been modernized, war has also been rationalized. \n\tHarari examines premodern wars to modern wars, proving to his readers how war has been modernized into a commodity to feed the growing economy and money hungry elites. War is no longer about gaining land and growing your empire but gaining money so war can continue with no clear winner or goal.\n\t",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n2/26/2021\nEssay Brief 5\n\tThroughout all of history there has been a struggle for power whether it be for an individual, group, or organization. This power does not come without pushing others down, and can be seen by examples of slavery, racism, or other types of prejudice. Groups such as African Americans, Asians, Native Americans, and women have had to push against being denied basic human rights in America along with being socially outcasted because of a feature they cannot control. Even in the modern day it is discussed about if there is true equal opportunity for everyone and whether certain groups are targeted for actions more than others in instances of applications, policing, and discrimination.\n\tOne group of people that continue fighting the systems set in place today are feminists. They have combated and resisted ideas pushed on them in the past such as the nuclear family, caretaking responsibilities, and the meaning of femininity. A representation of this is shown in The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Gilman. The husband in the story, John uses his power as the head of the household to keep his wife in the house telling her she cannot read, write, or go outside because it will make her condition very bad. She is reluctant to argue about it with him and does as she as told, therefore conceding her basic wants to someone who is seen in society as higher than her. Any woman at the time would not dare disobey her husband and would continue to stay in the marriage even if it was abusive. A woman\u2019s role during this period was to be submissive and listen to their husband because a man knows what\u2019s best. This power dynamic is what allowed John and many men to remain in power while oppressing women by doing so.\n\tThis display and want for power are what the matrix of domination is about. The matrix describes that this oppression is done through institutions or communities and grants each person certain privileges and penalties. These are all dependent on your standing in society and how each individual respond to it when forced upon them. African American women for example have not only been more subject to racism, but sexism as well. Just as in The Yellow Wallpaper, they have been told that they cannot do things because of either their race or gender because it is the opposite of who has been in power most history. One thing the matrix also analyzes is the difference in consequences because of those factors. A white feminist in the 1800\u2019s would not have been punished as hard as a black feminist would have been because of this race disparity.\n\tEvery person is subject to some kind of prejudice because of how society or an individual views them. It is the response of the individual that matters by not conforming how the dominator wishes them to act. The feeling of superiority is what keeps discrimination and matrix of domination in place, meaning that there is no true equality until it is dismantled. This process is not something that can change fast because it is a result of the collective conscious of a society and similar mindsets are passed on for generations.",

This is far from the truth. Gregory Mantsios mentioned this among other \u201cmyths\u201d about our society. He mentions four main ones. These \u201cmyths\u201d are essentiality beliefs of our collective consciousness as a nation. The first belief I already expanded on which is that the U.S. is a fundamentally classless society. The second belief is that we are a middle-class nation. The third belief is we are all getting richer. The fourth belief is Everyone has an equal chance to succeed. Our class system contradicts every single one of these beliefs. As a nation there are huge differences in class, the gap between classes is great. Distribution of wealth is completely skewed, the middle class holds a small percent of the nation\u2019s wealth, and that percent is falling. As a nation we are taught to believe we have an equal chance to succeed, but there is no doubt that class standing helps people succeed while it hinders others. We are also taught to believe that our government is democratic and fair. While this is mostly true, some people have more power than they should. This group is called the Power Elite. Domhoff talked of the Power elite and their influence on federal government.\n\tAs a nation it is a part of our culture and collective consciousness to believe in things such as the American dream, but it is just an illusion. Not everybody can achieve the American dream especially those living in poverty. Our class system contradicts many beliefs as An American.",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n28 April 2021\nModern American Racism: White Privilege \n\tRace has no basis in genetics whatsoever; it is entirely socially constructed. Just because race is not in our DNA does not mean the effects of it are not real. The meaning of slavery has changed over time; slavery used to be a period of bondage that an ancient person might pass through; today, when we think of slavery, we picture the enslavement of Africans in the United States. Slavery has been transformed into a racial issue over time and has triggered widespread racism all across the globe. Europeans created the idea of race to differentiate between those who did and did not look like them. This idea of different races separated and belittled certain groups of humanity, making them appear not even human anymore. Categories such as \u2018savage\u2019 for Native Americans, \u2018subhuman\u2019 for Africans, and \u2018white\u2019 were created, instilling the idea of race. These categories separated groups of humans by skin color and dehumanized those of darker skin. By claiming Africans as \u2018subhuman,\u2019 whites were able to strip them of their humanity and treat them as animals because that was how they were seen: like animals. As Europeans immigrated over to America, they took their ideas of race with them, developing an entirely new culture created by racism. As industrialism grew in America, so did the need for inexpensive labor; the Americans turned to the \u2018subhumans\u2019 in Africa. Whites kidnapped and sold Africans like animals, forcing them into slavery. Dark skin became an easy identifier for whether someone was a slave or not. The whites justified their enslavement of Africans with religion, economics, and science. They claimed that this race of subhumans could only be led from sin by a white master and that science proved that people of darker skin were not humans. These erroneous fundamentals helped shape and build American culture and society; the United States of America is founded on racism. \nAlthough Americans have come an incredibly long way from slavery, racism is still very much so prevalent in our society. American racism is no longer involves slavery or blunt dehumanization, but unjust inequalities not noticed by most. Things such as jobs, education, and luxury are catered more towards white Americans, leaving African Americans struggling. Yes, white Americans do have to deal with struggle and loss, but that pain will never be a result due to the color of their skin. As harsh racism of the past has begun to fade away, a new form of racism is taking its place: white privilege. White privilege is the advantages given to a white person due to their society or culture being founded or controlled by race. For many white people, the advantage they have due to their skin color is hard for them to comprehend and see. Often, white people are dismissive of the idea of white privilege and like to pretend it does not exist. The dismissal of white privilege makes it stronger and harder to fight. The more people who can recognize and understand their privilege, the more likely it is that this form of racism can be eliminated. Making racism illegal will not stop it; the best way to prevent racism is to exploit the racists that what they are doing is wrong and how it is wrong. Only by recognizing that the United States was built off racism and that white privilege thrives in society today; we will be able to take more steps of getting rid of racism completely. White privilege is a modern-day form of socially constructed racism to provide unfair advantages to those with white skin. \nIn class, we studied how racism and slavery began and evolved over time; with no roots in genetics, racism was completely socially constructed. Humans created race to dehumanize other humans with different skin colors. This allowed for the white race to gain power over other races and exploit them for labor. White people labeled those with darker skin complexions as animals and inhuman to justify their horrible mistreatment and racism. Slavery and other extreme forms of racism may no longer be present in the United States, but racism still exists in America. The United States of America\u2019s society and culture was founded on racism and that the white race is superior. These ideas are still structuring American society today, even with the advances taken to eradicate racism and establish equality for all. White people are still given unfair advantages in American society due to their skin color. Things such as work, power, and education are unfairly leaned in favor of white people, making it extremely hard for people of color to access these things. White privilege is an existing system within American society the promotes and upholds racism. It encases the idea that white people will never have to deal with struggles or tragedies due to the color of their skin. Society created white privilege to keep its old racist structure in tack while the idea of equality for all became more widespread. \nThe concept of white privilege is often denied or misunderstood by white people. They can see that people of color are struggling but they look at themselves to see that they are also struggling. Due to their own struggle, white people tend to think that they cannot possibly have an advantage over anyone because they are struggling too. These people fail to comprehend that they are not struggling due to the color of their skin. White privilege is not saying that white people have never had to deal with struggle; it is saying that white people have never dealt with struggle due to the color of their skin. Whites often feel that white poverty is neglected \u201cin order to portray poverty as a problem of black and brown\u201d people (Blacksher). It is beliefs like that which drive white people from accepting that white privilege exists. The \u201cdeflection, discomfort, and denial of such advantages have been called white fragility,\u201d which is when white people are unable or unwilling to recognize or accept that they have an advantage due to the color of their skin (Blacksher). White fragility dates back to when white people used science, religion, and economics to justify their poor treatment of people of color. Saying something along the lines of \u2018white privilege does not exist, I am just as poor as he is\u2019 is just as much as a dismissal of racism as \u2018it does not matter, those are animals, not people\u2019 is. By refusing to accept the existence of white privilege and American roots in racism, white people prevent the uprooting and eradication of racism.\nAlthough not all white people have open arms to accepting the concept of white privilege and its existence, some white people have. Studies have found as white people have been more exposed to the advantages provided to them due to race, feelings of \u201cguilt and shame are common reactions,\u201d (Pinterits). Many white people have been able to come to terms with their own privilege and accept that they are advantaged because of their skin color. Instead of white fragility, they associate with white guilt. Although white people alive today are not responsible for creating racism and American society, with failure to recognize their privilege, they must maintain it. A common response to white privilege may be \u201capathy, or avoidance,\u201d (Pinterits). Avoiding the subject ultimately could be due to feelings of discomfort or that they feel threatened by the discussion. Often when white privilege is pointed out, some white people feel like they are being attacked or called racist, but it\u2019s the refusal to have the conversation about white privilege which makes someone more racist. People who are more willing to talk about the privilege they hold because of their skin color are more inclined to make an effort or change to get rid of their privilege and strive for equality. Feelings of white guilt are entirely normal when talking about white privilege; what really matters whether someone is just going to continue to feel guilty or if they are going to make a real effort to combat white privilege. After conducting her study, Pinterits was able to determine that different white people had \u201cvarious behaviors to address white privilege and engage in anti-racism and social justice work.\u201d This shows that not all white people are unable to come to terms with their own white privilege and that some are willing to make a change. Yes, many white people are unwilling to talk about or recognize their own privilege. Still, on the flip side, some white people are ready and able to have a conversation about white privilege and what they can do to make a difference.\nRecognizing white privilege is one of the first steps towards gaining total equality. Some are able to comprehend they have an advantage due to the skin color but end up stuck, not knowing what to do next. Knowing how to see privilege is a powerful thing. By knowing what white privilege looks like, people are more likely able to recognize the personal privilege they hold and the institutions and rules that support that privilege. Being able to recognize white privilege is \u201cuseful for helping identify internalized, often invisible, forms of racism. It could also provide tools for unmasking a structural exclusion that ensures that people of color get the short stick every time,\u201d (Aouragh). As a white person being able to not only see your own privilege but the privilege of others and the systems that maintain that privilege is fundamental. With that, you can use your privilege to call out unjust systems and behaviors in order to help people of color reach equality. Things such as white fragility and silence stunt the growth of anti-racism and prevent other white people from speaking out. By recognizing and speaking out about their white privilege, white people are able to help promote ideals of equality and fight the racist American society and culture put into place hundreds of years ago.\nEradicating white privilege in America is one of the first steps of ridding the United States of racism. As a country that was built and founded on racist beliefs and ideologies, it will take time to unravel all the hate and prejudice that has been intertwined into American culture. In class, we went over how the United States of America was structured after racism and fitted white people as the power elite. Race was created so whites could dehumanize and exploit people of color. Whites justified their actions by claiming that people of color were not human or that only a white master could lead people of color from sin. Although these ideals have been thrown out in the United States today, racism and the system that maintains it is still in place. White privilege provides unfair advantages to white people due to the color of their skin. Still, if we contain to fight for equality for people of color and recognize our own privilege, we can end racism and build a better and more accepting society and culture for all humans to live. \nWorks Cited\nAouragh, Miriyam. \u201c\u2018White Privilege\u2019 and Shortcuts to Anti-Racism.\u201d SAGE Journals, SAGE Journals, 26 Sept. 2019, doi-org.liblink.uncw.edu/10.1177%2F0306396819874629. \nBlacksher , Erika, and Sean A Valles. \u201cWhite Privilege, White Poverty: Reckoning with Class and Race in America.\u201d The Hasting Center, The Hastings Center, 25 Feb. 2021, doi-org.liblink.uncw.edu/10.1002/hast.1230. \nPinterits, Janie E. \u201cThe White Privilege Attitudes Scale: Development and Initial Validation.\u201d EBSCOhost, American Psychological Association, July 2009, web.b.ebscohost.com.liblink.uncw.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=56157bfc-d108-4351-b112-2e775f38780e%40sessionmgr103&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ %3d%3d#AN=2009-10122-007&db=pdh. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While it is dependent on the person, the message is that all the materialistic things in the world cannot give satisfaction. Currency is the universal way to determine worth in a society, and it is adjusted based on the time, abundance, and skillset needed to produce something. A person\u2019s livelihood is dependent on what they can produce for the society and that society determines its value. \n\tA dependency on how a product is sought after is what allows another person to eat, sleep, and live comfortably. This is what Marx says is the only reason for people working and what Weber claims to keep people trapped inside of the system. Workers are driven for the sole purpose of getting money and contributing more to capitalism rather than what may actually be beneficial. Capitalism takes control over the lives of the people and the incentives are not healthy as products are made just for money instead of connecting the society together. Some workers do become connected with their work and see their product as more than an object, and something that the consumer will become attached to for years. This can be seen across the world in examples such as fashion, children\u2019s toys, and cars.\n\tI spent over a decade of my life at a summer camp that I wanted to and became a counselor there. I had personally become attached to the business and was willing to work there for any wage they would pay me, even if another job would offer more. These occupations that work with people rather than products draw attachment from workers and will still attract them, even if the pay is low. Teachers in America including my aunts have protested for higher pay since they are shaping the future of the country, and feel they are not represented based off their worth. It\u2019s for certain that less impactful jobs that benefit society get paid more than teachers, who are more of use, but that is capitalistic values.\n\tEveryone has unique skillsets and minds and it is applying that best to what they want to do. Whether we like it or not, we have values on what we can do and create. It is up to the individual to use and market those skills best while in a capitalistic system, all so they can live. The labor people do for the majority of their lives is not set in stone and the value of it will change throughout time, but it is done more so the purpose of living rather than beneficial.",

They wish to be themselves and make choices around their morals, while still looking to fit in a group and some level of social approval. This is because there is a \u201cself\u201d in each person, which is who you are and what you believe. There are different interpretations of how that self in each of us works and the impact society has on someone when they develop with different factors all around them.\n\tGeorge Mead was a philosopher who believed that because of communication, it allowed the self in everyone to have confliction for further development in every interaction. These experiences can then cause for a change in self, depending on the kind of previous experience along with how others are representing themselves in the current moment. That is this \u201cI\u201d in us which is formed from a reaction while the \u201cMe\u201d is then what is decided because of it. Erving Goffman was a social psychologist who also believed that society had an important role for how someone develops. He claims that when we are alone, that is when we really respond and prepare for the next social encounter, so it does not go poorly and allow for continuous acceptance in that group. Goffman compares us to performers that only wish for the show that is interaction to go well because of this, which also requires time to process how it went and then make for further changes. This ties into what Mead explains between the \u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe\u201d, where there is always feedback being given to one another for thought and analysis of what to keep and what to change for similar situations.\n\tWith those still wanting to fit in, the individual will want to show off or highlight their own special behavior because it is our natural calling. Every person\u2019s thoughts are different in some way because of who we are as people and what we do, and as time goes on this gap widens because of our experiences. Erving Goffman and George Mead both offer reasonable claims for how this process works, and ultimately agree on one core concept; Self reflection is the cause of change.",

        "text": "The Western Ideal of Beauty and Its Impact on Black and Asian Women\n\tBeauty standards are challenging enough to meet, and can lead to negative self-esteem in all women. But declines in mental health, self-esteem, and self-worth have a  more serious impact on Black and Asian communities due to the added internalization of racism. Omi and Winant explain in Racial Formations about the beginnings of racism as an institution in society meant to establish a dominant race - White Europeans. The process of racialization resulted in a racial hierarchy in society, where white people were superior over other groups of color through socially-constructed meanings added to race. This \u201csuperiority\u201d of the white race has translated over into beauty standards, as physical features associated with the ideal are Eurocentric. This leads to more problematic consequences for Black and Asian women, as they internalize these beauty standards and learn to dislike physical features associated with their race that they not only see in themselves, but also in other members of  their racial group. \n\tThis internalization of racism and beauty standards translates directly into how Black and Asian women approach and experience potential romantic relationships with members of different racial groups. This was investigated by a group of social scientists at the University of California, that interviewed a group of eighteen university students. A goal of the study was to gauge the impact of Western beauty standards and racism in media on interracial attraction. Scientists saw a common theme held by the majority of the sample, that supported that beauty standards portrayed through media heavily impact what racial groups are believed to be most attractive. The sample also concluded that through media perpetuation of Western beauty standards, white people are portrayed as more attractive and successful compared to minorities, who are usually portrayed in congruence with offensive racial stereotypes. Media also tends to portray white people more frequently than minorities, which also has an impact on how familiar people are with other racial groups (Silvestrini, 2019). These stereotypical and sparse portrayals of minorities in popular culture and media impact the public\u2019s judgements and familiarity with different racial groups. This leads to internalized racism as people choose to not pursue relationships with other specific racial groups because of negative, preconceived personality traits associated with certain physical features. This internalized racism is even present among minority groups, especially in Black and Asian populations as their traits deviate more from the Eurocentric standard. These variations are common among the features of people who identify within populations due to interracial attraction. Those who come from mixed-race backgrounds are found to be more highly valued as potential partners in Black and Asian populations, because they are closer in resemblance to the Western model. Due to the role of beauty standards and internalized racism in interracial attraction, Black and Asian women may start to see themselves as undesirable romantically, which can further translate into feeling completely undesirable. \n\tBesides the usage of cosmetics and forms of dieting, another way that women can change their appearance to conform is through cosmetic surgery. This is the most expensive form of physical alterations, but it has become more common, with the United States, South Korea, and Brazil being the leading nations in this industry. In a study performed by Dr. Alexander Edmonds from Britain and Dr. So Yeon Leem from South Korea, the relationship between plastic surgery and racial phenotypes were analyzed to explore popular procedures in different countries, and show that race can be measured. This research was conducted through interviewing surgeons in all three countries, and analyzing medical and historical literature about the initial purposes of cosmetic surgery. In their study, they highlighted different surgical procedures that were especially popular in all three nations. In the US, they found that rhinoplasties were very common among patients that wanted to elongate and thin their noses. Rhinoplasties are also very common in South Korea and Brazil, as well as higher rates of skin-lightening procedures (glutathione injections). Another popular procedure more specific to South Korea is the double-eyelid procedure, which is a surgery that adds a crease to the upper lid of the eye that changes the appearance of the Asian monolid. These cosmetic procedures all result in patients appearing more Western, as common features of the Eurocentric beauty model are a whiter skin-tone, a smaller and thinner nose, and double-eyelids. The researchers discovered, however, that on the surface, the marketing and methods used in plastic surgery do not advertise Westernization of features directly. While plastic surgery is initially meant to help individuals look more similar to Europeans, a term referred to as \u201cpassing\u201d, that has changed over the years as more Black and Asian people have received procedures, or are of mixed-race. In the US and South Korea, reference images of plastic surgery have changed to better fit the race of the individual seeking a certain trait. This is due to the science of anthropometry, which centers on the study of measurements and proportions of the human body. Through the usage of anthropometric facial analyses, surgeons are able to integrate Western features more naturally into the faces of Black and Asian women, and therefore create more accurate reference images that do not utilize solely European or white models. Through the usage of anthropometry, the marketing message of the plastic surgery industry has changed from the concept of \u201cpassing\u201d to building upon the natural beauty of Black and Asian women (Edmonds & Leem, 2020). While the shift in message and methodology within the plastic surgery industry says otherwise, the core of the cosmetic industry in these countries remains the same in its intentions. The plastic surgery industry still relays the message to women that their \u201cimperfections\u201d should be corrected to correlate with beauty standards. The existence of anthropometry also shows that race cannot solely be deemed a social construct. While racial meanings are socially-constructed, as Omi and Winant propose, the differences between races can be scientifically measured through analysis of racial phenotypes. These differences in racial phenotypes are then medicalized, and operated on - providing a substantial livelihood to plastic surgeons all around the world. While the US and South Korean cosmetic surgery industries capitalize off of the idea of racial enhancement, researchers found another concept that drives the Brazilian cosmetic surgery industry. The concept of a \u201cmeta-race\u201d refers to the perfect mixture of African and Eurocentric skin tones and features. This model however implies that there can be an excess of African traits present, and that those traits must be balanced out by Eurocentric ones (Edmonds & Leem, 2020). Cosmetic procedures are expensive and come with risks having to do with health complications and/or the surgeon who performs them. Overall, cosmetic surgery may stand to correct the superficial, but on the inside low self-esteem and internalized racism persist as Black and Asian women see their racial features as unattractive and abnormal.\n\tInternalization of the Western ideal of beauty not only is detrimental to women of color on an individual level, but also on a societal level. On the individual level, Black and Asian women face lower self-esteem and self-worth that can impact the quality of their relationships and careers. This can also lead to other serious mental and physical health conditions, such as eating disorders, anxiety, and depression. As women of color internalize beauty standards, they also tend to internalize racism. This leads to poorer relationships with others of their racial/ethnic groups and a lack of appreciation for their culture in general. As these attitudes are combined in society, internalization of beauty standards serves to threaten diversity as a whole. With more assimilation towards Eurocentric ideals, the world loses the uniqueness of culture that contributes to its overall beauty. Diversity in body types, skin tones, and facial features should be celebrated, as there is much more diversity than there are women that completely fill this standard. \nWorks Cited\nEdmonds, A., &amp; Leem, S.

        "text": "\tReligion is a common part of our society\u2019s collective consciousness.  Like many, I believe in my religious faith and I feel that my belief is genuine. I thought I chose to be religious on my own but apparently, that\u2019s not completely true. As humans we are predisposed to be religious as a reaction to existential fears. Whether we think we are acting on our own or not, our behaviors are affected by cognitive conditions that have developed over millions of years.\n\n\tThe first evidence of religion was dated to around the same time we gained the capacity for abstract thought. The reason for this is because we gained the awareness to be able to ask the scary big questions, like \u201cwhat happens after you die?\u201d Because of the complete uncertainty to questions like this, they are the basis of existential fears. Religion provides us with comfort and answers to exertional fears. This prevents us from living in fear and uncertainty. Without the development of complex emotions, abstract thought could not exist. The capacity for emotion and the intelligence of a species are directly correlated. Modern humans have a wider range and capacity for emotion compared to our ancestorial species of the great ape. For instance, our amygdala is twice in size compared to that of the great ape. The growth of our ability to feel a wide array of emotions along with the connection of neural networks over time helped us gain our capacity for language and abstract thought.\n\n\tDespite how special religion can make you feel, it is a normal behavior that has been around as long as we have been able to speak. Religion is not solely a decision you make as an individual, but a behavior in reaction to our natural fears of existence.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

        "text": "5053\nSharing a Social Stage\nThere are times when two people are talking, and their thoughts just seem to click. This is no coincidence. Humans have been assigning spiritual and conceptual meanings to the natural world since they first started forming abstract thoughts. This is the basis for animist religion which has shaped how humans view the natural and synthetic world. Due to this shaping of the perceived world, things like social stages can form. A social stage is the shared idea of how an individual \u201cactor\u201d should perform in a given social setting. So, for these two ideas to be possible they need to work as a collective unit. These two concepts work together through social actors playing into animism, creating their own animistic \u201cprops,\u201d and doing the opposite of what is expected from the animistic setting.\n \tAnimist religion is a part of every person's daily life. Whether it be knocking on wood or wishing on a dandelion, these are both examples of animist religion. Ever since humans developed the capacity for abstract thought, they have been searching for ways to give their own lives meaning. Animist religion is a great way of accomplishing that because it gives spiritual meaning to otherwise meaningless aspects of life. This enables environments to be seen differently than what they physically present themselves as. For example, a beach is a collection of sand and shells next to an ocean. These things by themselves mean nothing more than a functioning ecosystem. Through the practice of animist religion, a beach can mean a day full of fun, relaxation, and bonding with others. This is the social stage that animist religion has created for the beach. It becomes bigger than each individual object and becomes a universally understood social environment. \nSocial stages can also lead to the development of animism that might not already exist for a certain setting. For example, a police station compared to a doctor's office. These locations share many rudimentary objects in common such as a front desk. But a front desk at a doctor's office feels much more welcoming than a front desk at a police station. The social stage set at these locations are drastically different. At a doctor\u2019s office, the social actors are nurses and physicians whose primary goal is to make a person feel welcome. While the social actors at a police station consist of police officers and detectives. These figures are playing a much more intimidating role, so naturally a person will feel less welcome there. Both these locations also share rooms in the back where a person goes to be one on one with different social actors. Obviously, the contents of these rooms differ, but that is not the only thing that makes the emotions a person feels inside these rooms so different. When a police officer takes someone back in the police station, they are doing it in an intentionally intimidating manner to provoke cooperability out of whoever they are going to speak to. When a nurse leads an individual to their room, they do it intentionally soothingly to ensure that the person feels safe. These are a couple of examples of how social actors influence the animism of different social settings.\nSocial actors can also do the opposite of what is expected from the animistic beliefs surrounding an object to play into different social stages. Going into a social setting knowing what is expected of you is a powerful tool. The obvious course of action is to use that knowledge to play the part socially assigned to you. Another less tapped option is to do the opposite. Some strong public speakers use this method to grab their listener\u2019s attention. A great example of this being done in practice is an elementary school BMX anti-bullying campaign. When the average person hears about speakers coming to talk about the problems of bullying, they will be expecting a put together person coming in with a well-prepared speech. In the case of this specific anti-bullying campaign, it could not be any more different. Instead of a designated speaker it is a group of people all doing stunts on BMX bikes while talking about the problems with bullying in between sets. It may not be the most informative way of going about it, but it is one of the most memorable. \nThe power that social actors hold is immense. Especially when said actor is aware of the potential they have to manipulate their surroundings to benefit their performance. Understanding animism and how it can be applied to daily life can take a person's social acting to another level of convincing. It is evident that trying to comprehend animism without the help of social acting is a dead end, and vice versa. You cannot have one without the other.",

        "text": "Reflection Essay 850595807\n\n\tSo why is it that over years and years of women fighting back during the first wave feminist movement surrounding the right to vote, the second wave feminism movement focusing on equality and anti-discrimination, and the third wave feminism? It may seem like efforts to break away from things such as the beauty myth have done nothing but women\u2019s work against this fight hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Although it has taken time women need to continue to overlook the societal standards of the beauty myth placed on them by men that objectify and subordinate women. \n\tWith that being said one of my experience that occurred based off my looks was my first job. My first job ever was at a dive bar. When I applied for the job, I was applying for food prep before it goes out to the tables and taking it to the tables because that is what my friend Alyssa \n\n\ndid there and I wanted to do the same, working with her. In my interview process that wasn\u2019t the case. I had the male manager interview me and instead of offering me the job working back of the house he offered me the position to be the hostess. The hostess greats costumers once they enter the restaurant and set the tone for the visit there. The manager implied that this job was better for me because I was pretty, and they needed someone pretty to work the door and set a good mood for the costumer\u2019s experience at our bar. \n\tWith working at a dive bar, it is also no surprise that the kegs our customers go through is like a revolving door constantly needing to be changed. At my bar our kegs were stored in a cooler with two shelfs and bottom shelf only about a foot above the ground and the top shelf about 4 feet above the ground. For those that don\u2019t know an average keg that is full of beer weights about 100 pounds and empty they weight about 30 pounds. As a girl most people don\u2019t expect for me to be able to pick up a 100pound keg let alone put it on the top self 4 feet above the ground. \n\t I was never once asked to go change a keg. At our bar it was normal to yell keg change and our manager would always go to the big guys that worked in the kitchen and the men would go and change the keg. Why did me and all my bartenders as women never get asked to change them because we were \u201cweak\u201d?  Or we would get comments from our manager like don\u2019t change the keg you\u2019re going to \u201cblow your back\u201d. How come comments like that never got said to any of the men. With that being said, me and the girls really turned a blind eye to that and would still go change and change the keg anyways. Nobody at my work knew I lifted at the gym everyday let alone picking up 100 pounds was practically nothing for me to pick up without hurting myself. I was more than capable of changing a keg on both the bottom and top shelf. Not just \n\nthat but the guys would be busy in the kitchen why wait until the cooks would have a break to change the keg when you have women who are more that capable to change a keg. The manager would simply say no because we were women. \n\tI\u2019ve introduced this topic of the beauty myth so what exactly is it?  Naomi Wolfs Beauty Myth is based off of a modern version of social reflex it is a concept that society has created this ideal image of a women, but this standard is not for or in support of women. Women become concerned with things such as their hair, makeup, body, and their clothes based on the concepts surrounding beauty created by men. Naomi Wolf also stated that \u201cThe quality called \u201cbeauty\u201d objectively and universally exists.\u201d Women must want to embody the beauty myth because it is necessary and natural for society. It has existed since the earliest societies in our time and still follows through till present day.  The myth has been used as a power structure against women and a fight against feminism while it sets unrealistic beauty standards for women. As women we become so focused on what we look like and how society makes us look.  We then focus on tearing each other down based off of which one of us is more attractive rather than bringing each other as a community\n\tSo how does any of this theory of the beauty myth fit into my life as a woman \u2026well it happens to be part of my everyday life. Earlier I explained that rather than getting a job helping with food in back of the house I was told I wasn\u2019t suitable for that job and that front of the house as a hostess was for me because I was pretty that was just part of it. Sadly, enough in that aspect of my job I let myself become consumed with the beauty myth. The words I get payed to stand here and look pretty came out of my mouth almost every single shift and In, a way it was true. I \n\n\nwas given that job working the door not based off of experience or a good resume it was 100% based off of the fact that a majority of people would agree that I fit into beauty standards. Not just that but anytime anyone pretty would come in for an interview I would get territorial and go mean girl on them. I saw it as competition for my job position and thought anyone remotely attractive could come in at any moment and sweep my job out from under me. I never thought of that before now I just saw it as my job being replaced but after learning the beauty myth I saw it as a threat because of standards imposed on women in todays\u2019 society due to the beauty myth because of men. \n\tAs I have mentioned it is no secret that there are certain expectations in how a woman should act, what she should look like, and what she should wear. Since the earliest times in history the men in society have imposed a commodification on women\u2019s beauty for their own benefit. Such beauty standards on men\u2019s behalf subjected and objectified women\u2019s bodies to the point where women we\u2019re against each other in this system of power that then benefitted men. Even though such pressure is present in today\u2019s society women need to continue to overlook the societal standards of the beauty myth placed on them by men. Some women might not even notice that they are falling into and being objectified by the beauty myth. It is one of those things that has been present in society for so long that it\u2019s hard to find the line of true reality sometimes. Just like me I, knew that certain beauty standards existed in society, but I never knew it to the extent of the theory of the beauty myth. Let alone did I expect to have beauty standards imposed on me at my first job ever just at the age of 17 years old. As a woman we are more than just a pretty face or nice body. If we don\u2019t work to stand up for ourselves nobody will. ",

        "text": "The discussion of gender, the influences, the struggles, and the importance of has been a focal point of philosophers and sociologists throughout history. There have been distinct differences in how gender is viewed in many societies, ranging from the Native Americans to the Japanese and to the Egyptians. One of the largest issues that have surrounded this topic is between the difference of gender, therefore gender expression, and biological sex which has led to even more oppression of women and minorities. \n\tSimone De Beauvoir\u2019s work titled Woman as Other describes how, for as long as documented history can tell, the idea of a woman has always been tied to the idea of men. In the discussion of this duality, it puts the idea of a woman as being solely linked to their biological sex and therefor their genitals. The Beauty Myth that Naomi Wolf writes about discusses how femininity and beauty are the two qualifiers for womanhood, how, by the decree of society, the only way that a woman can possibly hold value is by being deemed beautiful and feminine. Both of these assumptions about what is means to be a woman not only place unforgiving qualifier on what it means to be a woman, it destroys what people over centuries have been trying to accomplish: defining womanhood by the ideas of women. The only people who should be defining what a woman is, is a woman, regardless of what their birth assigned sex is, or her portrayal of femininity, or her ideal beauty goals. Yet, people who do not and are unwilling to understand this concept still oppress women and minorities, including Transgender people. ",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n12 February 2021\nEssay Brief 3\nAt birth, you are assigned your sex by the appearance of your genitalia. This assignment affects your gender, which is a socially learned set of behaviors associated with your sex. The roles of gender were developed by the collective consciousness, which men made. Gender roles have reinforced ideas such as men going to work while women stay home with the kids or working subservient jobs since the beginning of time. The concept of gender has been used to hold women back from advancing in society and stop them from changing the collective consciousness. Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s works display how gender roles have prevented women from reaching total equality.\nIn The Yellow Wallpaper, Gilman shares a story about a woman who is struggling with being oppressed. The woman has been told that she is sick by her husband when she actually realizes she\u2019s being held back from her full potential. She is not allowed to write or even think too hard without being met by harsh criticism. By telling his wife that she is sick, John keeps his wife confined to the gender role of being an obedient housewife. Likewise, in Women as Other, Beauvoir asserts that men are essential in the lives of women, but women are not necessary to men; \u201cHe is the Subject; he is Absolute. She is the Other.\u201d It is the woman\u2019s role to be an object for the man instead of being her own person and member of society.\n Both works display how assigned gender roles have held women back and isolated them from contributing to society. Although gender may help us identify who we are, gender roles are harmful and prevent people, especially women, from impacting the world. \n \n",

People formed groups based off their opinion of what god(s) they think are real and live their entire lives around religious beliefs. Religious texts such as the Bible and Quran are scriptures that people read and follow that listen to their teachings, which causes confliction as societal values may digress from the values that were centuries ago. These people form a collective conscious of their own by following specific practices such as prayers or fasting. One question that must be asked from this is did the people choose a religion from their values, or did they choose values because of their religion?\n\tOne thing Harari mentions that helps understand this question more is the uprising of the LGBT community in the mid-20th century. Harari mentions Ted McIlvenna who founds the Council on Religion and the Homosexual to help protect non heterosexual members in the modern from discrimination. This becomes a war against the longest traveling of collective consciousness in religion where these religious texts are used as reasoning for discrimination. These religious people then fight what they consider a modern-day crusade to combat a more modern collective conscious that is looking to loosen ties with traditional values. Examples such as this are what create generation defining experiences and make people of similar ages more relatable to each other, as they are more likely to have similar experience and takeaways from them that cause unification. Harari says that we all have universal ethics for things such as stealing and murder which is why there has not been as much debate among those topics, but religion looks to take it further and claim ideology on more from this ground. However, when generalization happens of what a religion says to practice, a dislike for one topic may become a dislike for the entire religion and influence other morals.\n\tWhether an individual believes in a god or not, they still have a moral compass that will dictate their actions and what is seen as acceptable. Religion is just another factor that looks to justify their actions with the collective conscious either adding support or clashing with them. Likeminded people will always be able to find each other in the world which is why people will always attract a crowd to them throughout life, regardless of how they are. History has also shown that religion is something that cannot just disappear slowly, thus allowing every generation so far access to values that may even be for completely incomparable societies than ones that have existed.

        "text": "8808\nSociology 105-007\n20 April 2023\nThe Appeal of Greek Life to Young Men: A Sociological Analysis\nWhy are fraternities such an appealing aspect of upper-level education for young men? It seems that every university across the nation has implemented Greek life as a means to promote a \u201cbrotherhood\u201d among their environments. The largest college campuses in the country are riddled with different sectors of Greek houses. Furthermore, fraternity parties are the big events in town on the weekends. Of course, college students love to party, the only issue is that men who are not in the fraternity cannot participate in fraternity parties or events. So how is it that Greek life at large universities has taken such a big stand in developing the social aspect of a college? It has to do with certain societal norms and concepts illustrated by ideas like \u201cdoing gender\u201d and \u201chegemonic masculinity,\u201d and the appeal carries significant relevance to Brian Stoudt\u2019s \u201cIn or Out\u201d dilemma involving the Rockport boys. \nPrior to coming to university, I had minimal knowledge of what a fraternity is. I knew that pledges (people who have pledged to the fraternity and are going through their initiation) are hazed for weeks on end. There are stories of people having to do some outrageous things in order to show their allegiance to the fraternity. When I arrived at UNCW for my first semester in the fall, I learned about \u201crush week.\u201d This is when students attend dozens of fraternity events at numerous different houses, and decide which frat seemed best for them. I had a blast, attending parties here and there and meeting new people. However, every time I would meet a new person, the conversation always ended up with, \u201chey man, are you rushing?\u201d It was almost like that becomes your new personality trait; as if rushing a fraternity made you a more appealing person. When rush week ended, parties became closed to the general public, meaning only females, and the pledges could attend. The whole process changed my point of view on fraternities entirely.\nSure, it was fun to go to these parties and experience college a little bit, but would it have been worth it to rush? After seeing some of my peers go through the process, I reassured myself I made the right decision. Some of them would miss class, some were exhausted all of the time, others disappeared from my daily routes to class, and all of them wore suits for a semester. Who would want to give up half of their first school year to wear suits in 80-degree weather, get bossed around, and do unspeakable things for a semester? Perhaps people would say it is worth it after the semester when they get to party, but this is where I formed my dilemma. What is so appealing about suffering for a semester to most college guys? Why does it become a personality trait, and why is it a huge part of college in the first place? \nDoing gender is a sociological concept by Candace West and Don Zimmerman that refers to the ways in which people actively perform their gender roles and behaviors in a social setting. The idea is that gender is not just the sex we were born as, but rather something we need to learn and perform to fit the societal role. During this process, people will actively participate in maintaining gender through their actions and interactions. We each learn to behave in accordance with what society deems normal for what a gender is and should be. People are ultimately rewarded through these norms and face negative backlash for failing to conform to these roles. Doing gender for a guy may be holding the door open for a lady or carrying the heavy groceries in from inside. Doing gender for a woman may be cleaning up around the house and being emotional support for men.\nHegemonic masculinity is another sociological concept that refers to the dominant form of masculinity that is idealized and reinforced in a particular culture or society. It represents the specific set of traits and behaviors that are socially valued and associated with being a \"real man\". Hegemonic masculinity is characterized by traits such as strength, toughness, and independence, as well as the ability to control and dominate others. Another important aspect of hegemonic masculinity is not showing emotion. This idealized form of masculinity is often associated with power and privilege, and it is reinforced especially through media, sports, entertainment, and society itself. Men who conform to this ideal are given status and respect, while those who do not adapt may face negative consequences such as discrimination or marginalization.\nIn Brian Stroudt\u2019s \u201cIn or Out,\u201d he conducts a social experiment in an all-boys prestigious private school called \u201cRockport.\u201d The boys in Rockport are part of a culture that values traditional forms of masculinity, which includes traits such as physical strength, aggression, and toughness. In order to be accepted and respected within their peer group, the boys must conform to these masculine norms and expectations. They engage in activities such as playing sports, fighting, hazing, and bullying as a way of demonstrating their masculinity and asserting their social status. The boys often make sexist jokes with teachers and pick on the boys that aren\u2019t \u201cmanly enough.\u201d However, the study also reveals a few outliers in the school. For example, some boys show plenty of emotion and view woman as equals. Some reject the masculine ideology all-together. A few have even criticized the school for not learning the teachings of some famous women. Although, there are a few outliers, many support the hegemonic masculinity and culture created at this school and embrace it. \nI know I am a culprit of doing gender myself. As a straight male, I was raised to conform to the traditional societal roles of being a man. My mom taught me to be a gentleman, hold the door, and help females with the heavy lifting. I always make sure I shake someone\u2019s hand and look them in the eye as well. When I am older, I know that I must have a successful job to provide for my family (because that is the traditional job of the male). Fraternities are clearly endorsers of this philosophy. As an all-male institution inside of a university, they must show certain characteristics to the school. These fraternities must uphold a standard to the community to stay alive and recognized by the university. Therefore, fraternities attend community events, hold fundraisers for charity, and set a moral code on campus. These ideas promote doing gender in a way where men must be successful and prosperous. They must act without recognition from the community. This is why fraternities often make their pledges wear suits around campus; to show that they are part of a successful brotherhood. You will never see a fraternity brother act like a female, where female clothes, or fail to promote characteristics of a male. \nOn a larger scale, hegemonic masculinity is perhaps the most prominent concept upheld by fraternities. I, myself, don\u2019t believe I support hegemonic masculinity throughout my everyday actions. However, I am someone who has played sports my entire life. Football is especially one of those sports where you must compete and dominate your opponent. Fraternities often engage in rituals and competitions to assert dominance and be more \u201cmanly\u201d than their counterparts. For example, fraternities will often engage in excessive alcohol consumption, or compete for women. In this way each brother can compete to win. They often treat woman as sexual objects rather than people. Alcohol use attests to their tolerance and if they can hold their beer better than others or have more to get them drunk. Furthermore, hazing is a huge part of the process. The pledges must go through hazing to see if they are man enough to be a part of the fraternity. They must pass the test to the rest of the brothers. The higher-ups in the fraternity are also asserting their power over the newer members by making them do things for them through hazing. Each of these aspects are fundamental features of fraternity life, and they cater directly to the sociological concept of hegemonic masculinity.\nBrian Stroudt\u2019s social study of the Rockport boys in his \u201cIn or Out\u201d is perhaps the most effective comparison to fraternity life. The Rockport boys show numerous examples of using hegemonic masculinity to gain an edge over their classmates, while each of them is being taught every day how to be a man (doing gender). The teachers are noted making sexist jokes with the boys, while many of the boys exclaim that woman are more of sexual gratification and trophies to be competed over. The all-male institution is very similar to a fraternity; mostly because the boys compete with others in athletic competitions and school. It is also mentioned that many of them haze the younger students to see if they can be a part of the elite group at the school. The entire theme of the school is to be prestigious and superior and make it the highest level of education that they can. Many of these students will end up pledging to a fraternity to achieve the same status and competition as they did at Rockport. Whether they were being hazed, competing for girls, or supporting the successful agenda, they are each devoting themselves to hegemonic masculinity. Furthermore, they are all athletic, successful, and are working towards building a future for their upcoming families, all of which are traits for doing gender. \nFraternities are breeding grounds for the traditional aspects of male society. The reason they are so appealing to young men in universities is due to the male instincts involved with the institution. Whether it be upholding the general roles of what it takes to be a man, being involved in a brotherhood, or competing with other men to assert dominance and eventually build relationships, the aspects of doing gender and hegemonic masculinity are being presented. Brian Stroudt\u2019s study of the Rockport boys is a perfect example of why fraternities are built the way they are. Why would someone want to engage in a fraternity, even with knowing the hazing and toxic masculinity are involved? It is because these aspects are fundamental to the primal instincts of men. There are positives and negatives, but no matter the case, these sociological concepts will cater directly into the unconscious instincts of men. It may be one of the few traditional male institutions remaining in our consistently-changing world. ",

        "text": "White privilege and its effect on our society\n\tBefore colonization took the world by storm, we lived in isolated groups that most the time shared the same color of skin, religion, and shared set of beliefs called our collective consciousness. Now days we live in diverse communities with varying religions, races, and beliefs. Despite this difference we still manage to share certain ideals and views as Americans. We have made great strides towards racial and gender equality. Our society has changed a lot, but nevertheless change is slow. America is known as the land of opportunity. Then why are the same people that founded this country still the ones at the top? That does not sound like opportunity to me. This is because the white Europeans that founded this country established a system and society that operates and benefits their selves. Despite what we are taught to believe, we still live in a white European centric masculinist society. This is why whites benefit from something we call white privilege. \n\tErving Goffman says the self is made up of a structure of social encounters. White privilege plays a part in this development of identity. It has drastic effects on our society and the people in it. It results in a change of how whites and minority groups view themselves self, in different ways. Not only does white privilege change your sense of self, but it also actively prevents minorities from having equal opportunity as whites, while helping whites succeed. What does this mean and in what situations does white privilege take place? This can be from education, to politics, and also wealth disparities. As white privilege has become more of a focal point to our society in recent years, there is plenty of fresh research that applies to how white privilege brings down minorities while keeping whites at the top. Throughout this paper I will expand on how white privilege changes our sense of self, the structure of white privilege, and also how it affects certain groups when it comes to wealth education political action and other fields. \n\tWhether we like it, or not racial and gender stereotypes are a part of our society\u2019s collective consciousness. We might not realize it but subconsciously we have been taught to associate certain qualities with certain groups of people. These stereotypes play part in us \u201cplaying our roles\u201d. In every social situation we identify the situation and try to fit a role. Since everyone is aware of how people expect them to act whether because the color of their skin or gender, people feel pressured to fit those stereotypes. Our sense of self changes based our reaction to these social reactions. For example, whites are handed unearned benefits at every turn. If a person is continually treated this way, it will have an effect on how they view themselves. This privilege can lead to unearned feelings of entitlement and superiority. This change of identity also takes place in minority groups in a different way. If you are taught your whole life that you are lesser than others just because of the color of your skin or your gender, you might start to believe it. This leads to subordination, self-hate, and an unjustified feeling of being inferior. This process is more subtle than it sounds, people might not even be completely aware they are being treated differently or the effect it has on their sense of self. The fact we are becoming more aware of white privilege is already a good indicator that we are headed in the right direction. Even so our collective consciousness of shared beliefs is deeply rooted into our society and will take a long time to make a permanent positive change.\n\tIn class we talked about the Matrix of domination. Where there are people being oppressed there will also be oppressors. There are three main levels of oppression that people can experience: the level of personal biography, group or community oppression, and then systemic oppression. White privilege is an example of systematic oppression towards minorities and women. White women fall into an interesting group of being an oppressor and being oppressed simultaneously.  Another interesting group to look at is women who are also minorities. They are systematically oppressed not only because their skin color but also because they are women. Nobody has it harder than women of color in our society. Knowledge plays a huge role in how oppression operates. People who are less knowledgeful and educated are more easily influenced and taken advantage of. At points in history both minorities and women were denied education. This lack of knowledge and keeping these oppressed groups uneducated fosters subordination. Till this day these groups are denied a voice and equal attention. Our society focuses on the power elite white men, this gives them more control and a bigger voice. One example of this \u201cattention\u201d is how media and news stations tend to only care and report when something happens to a white person. If we want to change how our society oppresses women and minorities, we have to start giving them central attention and an equal voice. \n\tThere are endless examples and situations in which white privilege takes place. There are also plenty statistics to back these claims of unequal treatment. White privilege is involved in wealth disparities, health disparities, lack of equal education, unfair political action, unequal incarceration, and among many more. When it comes to wealth disparities there is a huge gap in pay between white men and non-white men. For example, Black women are on average paid 21,000 dollars less than their white counterparts for the same job (NPWF 2018). Not only is there a pay difference but whites are more likely to get better jobs than minorities or women that are just as qualified. There are also distinct differences in healthcare between races. For example, \u201cBlack women in the United States are more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth than women in any other race group\u201d (NPWF 2018). Black women are also three to four times more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than white women (NPWF 2018). Another place where minorities are put at a disadvantage compared to whites is our incarceration system. For example, \u201cBlack men constitute 6 percent of the US adult population but are approximately 35 percent of the prison population and are incarcerated at a rate six times that of white males\u201d (Marit Rahavi 2014). Another staggering statistic when it comes to incarceration is that \u201cUS incarceration rates for white men are 678 per hundred thousand and 91 per hundred thousand for white women. The incarceration rate for black men is a staggering six times greater than white men, and almost three times higher than for black women\u201d (Moser 2020)\n\tEven though we have made significant progress towards equality, we still have a long way to go. Whites continue to reap unearned benefits while minorities and women are continuously put at a disadvantage by our society. Through health disparities, wealth disparities, unequal incarceration rates, and in countless more situations. This treatment does not just prevent them from succeeding but it also affects their sense of self. Nobody deserves to feel like less just because the color of their skin or gender.  White privilege has been an issue for a long time and will continue to be one unless we make an effort from both sides to make a change. This entails giving racial minorities and women more attention and a bigger platform. We should also make an effort to get qualified women and racial minorities into positions of power, especially in the government. It will take active awareness, while accepting that white privilege is a real and relevant issue. \nWorks Cited\n\n\nAustingiem. (2014, October 03).

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n26 March 2021\nEssay Brief 8\n\tAs humans we allow our societies to be ruled by what we chose to believe in as a group. Whether it is religion or liberalism, we establish these ideas as the collective consciousness and shape our society based off them. In chapter three of Harari\u2019s book and in the work Microfoundations by Fligstein and MacAdams the idea that collective beliefs build and govern our society. \n\tHarari presents the idea that human authority has always come from a shared human idea, such as mythology. Humans use ideas like religion and liberalism to justify authority. He suggests humans now are moving towards establishing technology as the new source behind authority. Harari\u2019s idea that authority is maintained by human beliefs is closely tied to Fligstein and MacAdams\u2019s idea that humans are different than apes because we can share collective meanings with one another. \n\tBoth works associate with the idea that collective consciousness shapes human authority and decides what is right and acceptable in our society. Religion, liberalism, and technology are all forms of collective consciousness that control humans and their motives. \n",

White privilege plays part in the social structure in which the self forms and naturally reflects in the character of white people. For example, if someone is treated special, they will begin to believe they are special. These repeated social interactions will affect how you view yourself. This can lead to unearned feelings of entitlement and superiority. On the flip side other groups of people are put at a disadvantage. This also affects the sense of self in different ways. Instead of unearned feelings of confidence, you are brought unjustified hate. As a society we have learned these stereotypes over time and they have become part of our societies shared attitudes, a part of our collective conscious. Our society has a strong set of beliefs and it can take a long time for them to change. For thousands of years white men took power and used it to establish a system that benefits them. Our society still reflects that to this day in the form of white privilege and systematic disadvantages for other groups. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n26 February 2021\nEssay Brief 5\nRace falls into one of the many categories in the matrix of domination. It is used to prevent certain groups from advancing in society and contributes to creating the disparities caused by the matrix of domination. The idea behind the matrix of domination is that unrelated privileges such as race, gender, and sexuality shape and organize social order. Tomas Almaguer and Patricia Hill Collins show us that despite what category you fall into on the matrix of domination, whenever its racial or ethnical, if you are not the top dog on the matrix you will be oppressed. \nIn Race Racialization, Almaguer debates whether Latinos fall into the category of race or ethnicity. Race is defined by oppressors and is used to control social balance and hierarchies while ethnicity is created by members of a community to make a collective identity.  Almaguer hints that the US government has constantly gone back and forth between Latinos being a racial or an ethnic group. The answer is simple really, Latinos are both. Latinos share their religion, culture, and language with one another, but they also share the oppression from the dominate caucasian group. There is so much debate where Latinos belong because they are both a racial and ethnic group, there is not a wrong answer.\nThe matrix of domination is social order based off of race, gender, and other categories created by the dominant white male group to oppress and force other groups into subservient roles. Patricia Hill Collins exhibits how this social hierarchy inhibits the white male population from seeing the discrepancies suffered among the subordinate groups. Old white men are unable to complete accurate social studies on inequality because they have never been victim to it. You cannot properly conduct research on inequality if you have a natural bias or if you have no idea what inequality looks like. \nAlmaguer and Collins present how it does not matter if you fall into the race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality groups in the matrix of domination, you will be met by oppression and inequality. The higher up you are on the matrix the more immune you are to not only suffering from inequality but seeing it. ",
