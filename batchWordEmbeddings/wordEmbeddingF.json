These reactions, natural or not end up setting humans more complex and true relationships back due to the tendency to authenticate a more consumable or pleasurable outward persona. It ends up preventing true connection within our groups, also known as fulfilling our existential function to form true social connections. \n\nThe Looking-Glass self is the biological tendency to rearrange one\u2019s true self into a more socially accepted person. People shape their perceptions of themselves on how other individuals or groups perceive their outward persona. This habit can make an entirely new personality for a person. Changing small or big aspects of someone\u2019s character to then perfect the outermost persona is essentially basing yourself on a lie or reaction. Thus, this persona is inherently fragile, seeing that it can be built up by lies and false persona. This is the explanation for how people nowadays find they\u2019re different around different types of people. Everyone finds a way to adjust to different groups, strangers, authority figures versus friends, and being alone. Different groups require different necessities, whether it be an honest person, a comedian, a supportive friend, a worker, etc. These different necessities are observable to humans. They pick up on these social queues and in turn, adapt to that group. Some people are better than others at this, practically chameleon-like with their ability to jump from group to group and fit in seamlessly. People also find themselves being naturally withdrawn, calm, polite, and the best version of themselves according to the society that specific person was raised in. Another clear distinction of attitude is the reaction of peers versus an authority figure. When a person is amongst peers they trust or feel they can relate to, they relax in turn. Very laid back and calm in response to their surrounding stimuli. Now at the other end of that spectrum is the authority figure. A person\u2019s attitude will become rigid, perfected, and attentive. This is another reaction nobody thinks about, it is drummed into you at an early age and only progresses clearer as one matures. Finally, there\u2019s being alone. This is where all the other relationships combine and form what one perceives as the true \u2018them.\u2019 People will combine all of their roles in their lives, or their multiple mirrors formed by their social reaction to determine their true self. In reality, this is solely the culmination of reactions to certain social stimuli and can change based on minute situational alterations. Each of these reactions are all very natural; they are practically reflexes to the masses of people across the world. Some differentiation in mannerisms is obviously common and possible but the majority conforms to their instincts. \n\n\u201cThe existential function of social\u201d is humanity\u2019s unique tendency to be more aware of social surroundings and the meaning of life. It\u2019s the search for the meaning of life but also knowing that they are not likely to find it. There are many subdivisions that apply to this function, such as collection collaboration capacity, individual vs group thinking, and group morals and values. Humanity has the habit of finding a group, a social setting to belong to. This is the \u201ccollective collaboration capacity\u201d, an ability in which humans naturally organize themselves within groups and find their places. When people find their groups or those whom they align with, they adapt to group thinking. It becomes a group affair, the exchange of knowledge, habits, cautionary information, and more. This can also implement a routine for group members. The final aspect of this function is conforming to the group\u2019s values, morals, and definition of meaning. When groups find each other, they work together. They help each other piece together aspects of the world into their meanings. Each person\u2019s experience gets put into the group and in turn, affects the final product of the group. The culmination of all of these subgroups within this function has numerous benefits such as taking stress off an individual, helping the mental function of an individual, putting a mind at peace, and having a sense of community for a social creature. When humans are solely individual and have to continuously function alone, this puts stress on the brain. The brain constantly interprets surrounding stimuli and is constantly working to understand and take in everything around them. Being on high alert 24/7 is a huge burden on the brain. This coincides with mental function in the sense that the brain being by itself and taking on that much work continuously will also tire the brain out. Its ability to function, let alone function well, is better within a group. Loneliness tires the brain and body out quickly. The group takes this burden from the individual. Finally, there\u2019s putting the mind at peace from the sense of community. The group helps put the individual\u2019s mind at ease by determining meaning along with giving each group member a sense of purpose and belonging. Since humans are social creatures, they find peace while fulfilling that need. The feeling that they know what they are doing for the group is good and worth it. Meaning is needed to define reality and the group aids that necessity.\n\nThe problem with defining oneself based on puzzle-piecing one\u2019s persona only around the reactions to different social settings is that many aspects of a person will get lost. Such aspects include the material self and pure ego. The material self-comprised of physical aspects or possessions that you identify with can be lost in different groups. Those pieces of oneself will deteriorate away, leaving a hole in one\u2019s persona. The other, is pure ego, the soul or essence of a person. This central component of a person is lost when outward perception is the only thing taken into consideration. People will lose these aspects and more to adapt to a group where they feel they belong. Although this is a natural process, it is also a cheat code that eventually can set you back in more complex and developed relationships. Changing small aspects of oneself and then later being more comfortable to then reveal the true desires, opinions, etc. can confuse the dynamic between the individual and the group. Collective Collaboration Capacity being where humans naturally find a place, due to their constructed personality (looking-glass self) can be set back when one adapts to a group or person, the relationship has that honeymoon phase or that start of a friendship, you change small aspects of yourself to better fit with that person or group dynamic. It\u2019s a cheat that ends up pushing you further away from those who can truly become close to you. Because in the end those outward personas become chipped away, leaving the true core of a person\u2019s nature. \n\nIn conclusion, the attempt to form true social connections is hindered by the instinct to form the best outward version of yourself to others. So, people should attempt to disregard their instincts to falsify the outside and be their truest selves. Let the culmination of their other selves beyond the looking-glass self shine. \n",

        "text": "Why White Privilege Still Exists in the United States\n\tDo all lives matter? One may answer, without hesitation, and out of the goodness in their heart, \u201cYes, of course they do\u201d. However, ask a black American who avoids certain neighborhoods in fear of being harassed and killed in the year of 2021 what they think. Ask any member of a Native American tribe, that is still alive and active today, and living on a reservation what they think. Ask the Mexican American children who are separated from their parents because ice arrested them, what they think? To say all lives matter would imply that there is equal respect and care for citizens of every race. Yet, there is not and there never was. At least not in the United States.\u00a0\nIt may be hard to believe that racial injustice as we all learned about in history class is still occurring even though we may not experience it personally. Even so, it is unfair to discredit racial minorities and claim that they are not oppressed if one is not aware of it. Therefore, the statement, \u201call lives matter\u201d is an invalid one that does not allow for racial minority groups to speak up about their issues and educate the public. Whether the protests are peaceful with sadness or violent with anger, the feelings of oppressed groups are still valid. The root behind most issues facing minority groups in the United States is race and the existence of White privilege. Throughout this essay, I will further explain what White privilege is, its\u2019 origin in the United States of America, the ways in which it is still present today and how it puts racial minority groups at a societal disadvantage.\nWhite privilege refers to the societal bias set towards White citizens. Being a white U.S citizen means that there is a systematic advantage to ensure that white people are being given first priority for most aspects in life. This may mean being hired over a person of color regardless of job qualifications, being the majority race at an institution due to historical segregation and racial biases, and having politicians and laws cater solely to one\u2019s own demographic. Such things create cases of injustice for people of color who have been subject to lesser opportunities and un-deservingness.\u00a0\nRacism is a motive behind white privilege as most white Americans may fear that the progression of rights and opportunities for another racial group or demographic may mean less for them. Therefore, as long as wealthy, white citizens have been in a position of power, they have been able to restrict the number of rights and power given to people of color. Simply put, systemic racism created white privilege, and white privilege enforces oppression on other racial groups. The problem is that this issue has existed for as long as the U.S has existed. Therefore, we as a society have to dissect how racism became institutionalized and identify the ways that these practices have evolved with time.\nIn the United states, race has always been heavily distinguished. One was either white or \u201ccolored\u201d. Even as a person of color, some individuals experienced more humane treatment with being visibly \u201cwhite passing\u201d. A clear indicator of racial privilege is the way in which ethnically ambiguous people were able to bypass racial discrimination. In being a racially divided nation, there was a lack of education on different cultures. Therefore, society functioned off of their knowledge on ignorance and stereotypes.\u00a0\nThe United States was built on colonization and racial division. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia, colonialism is, \u201ca practice of domination, which involves the subjugation of one people to another...colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of origin\u201d (Kohn, Margaret; Reddy, Kavita 2017). The issue mentioned in the definition here is that colonialism shares similarities with imperialism which involves taking over and taking command of. The similar trait between colonialism and imperialism is that it involves political and economic control over a dependent territory.\nNot only were European settlers colonizing indigenous lands, but they were also taking control over the indigenous people. This practice instilled a supremacist mindset as European migrants used dominance to enforce their culture on other ethnic groups. White supremacy is the mindset and belief that white people are the superior race. This mindset controlled who the U.S government felt was deserving and undeserving of certain rights. Therefore, first priority and privilege were granted to white citizens.\nThe early European settlers went on to force the Native American tribes to either conform to a Eurocentric lifestyle or to live in designated terrain so not to interfere with the settlers. This portion of U.S history instilled the belief that Native Americans were living incorrectly and that they were \u201csavages\u201d. Thousands of Native people were killed and subject to live within specified parameters on their own native continent. In prioritizing the European settlers over the native people, it left an eternal stain on the way in which our country operates today. Native reservations continue to decrease in size and lose access to clean water as the United States Government takes more of the land for construction and oil pipelines.\u00a0\nAnother historical event that influenced race and led to white privilege is slavery. The enslavement of African people further supported the idea of white supremacy because it permitted settlers and early white citizens to treat black people as animals and objects. Black people were chained up like prisoners, bought and sold like cattle, separated from their loved ones, starved, and physically abused. Some received a very small compensation to buy themselves out of slavery with time and others were only compensated with another day of life. Those who escaped slavery were hunted down and returned to slavery or sometimes even killed.\u00a0 Slavery created this idea that it was necessary to punish black people and limit their rights so that they could not live a life of equal quality to that of white people. Even following the abolishment of slavery, black Americans continued to be beaten, wrongfully imprisoned and lynched as \u201cfree\u201d U.S citizens.\n\u00a0In discussing Jim Crow and the civil rights movement, it is apparent that in the 20th century, black people were still being treated unfairly. They were forced to attend segregated churches, schools, and restaurants. There were, and still are many individuals who do not feel that black people, or POC in general are deserving of a qualitative life. Therefore, cases of implementing white privilege continue to occur and will not cease until they are called publicly acknowledged and parties are held accountable.\u00a0\nKnowing the origins of racial discrimination and white supremacy provides a foundation for understanding institutionalized racism and white privilege. The article, Raciontologies: Rethinking Anthropological Accounts of Institutional Racism and Enactments of White Supremacy in the United States explains the concept of racism in both the individual and institutional sense. The article favors the belief that racism in the United States is an institutionalized issue. It states that racism is a \u2018system of structural inequalities\u2019 and a \u2018historical process\u2019\u201d. The article makes note of the fact that the racial conflict that racial minorities face today started during the colonial times and has not ceased but instead evolved.\u00a0The author references Avram Bornstein in explaining that, \u201cpatterns in housing policies that (re)produce segregation and socioeconomic stratification, as well as education policies that structure school funding in relation to local property taxes and impose high\u2010stakes assessments. In all of these cases, \u201c\u2018institutional policies operate with or without conscious or unconscious bias, although there is a reinforcing connection between the two\u2019\u201d. \nIn observing the existence of white privilege today, A modern example of white privilege is prevalent in politics. As mentioned in the article White Privilege, White Poverty: Reckoning with Class and Race in America. The article uses the 206 presidential election to explain the mindset behind those who still enforce a white supremacist and white privilege mindset. During former president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, he tried to promote the idea of restoring a \u201cgreat America\u201d in creating more job opportunities for U.S citizens while simultaneously removing illegal immigrants who were \u201cstealing\u201d these job opportunities away. Trump\u2019s election generated four years of meritocracy. With white Americans being the majority population, such ideals seemed only to benefit their demographic. The wealthy and the white working class. Furthermore, it established a period of blatant hatred towards people of color as they were the targeted out to be the obstacle for the success of white Americans. The article explained it as being \u201csocial status anxiety\u201d and \u201cracialized economics\u201d which is the fear of one\u2019s own demographic falling behind with the progression of another demographic (Blacksher, Valles 2021). Therefore, the election and time period following brought attention to the fact that citizens based their presidential vote on personal advantage and that white Americans and politicians purposefully sought out to suppress minority groups. Therefore, reinforcing institutionalized racial prejudice.\nIn sending ICE to track down \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d, a stigma was created against Mexican Americans. In not openly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, supporters of former president Donald Trump disapproved with the movement and protested against it labeling protestors and supporters as \u201cthugs \u201cin the president\u2019s words. His responses alone, as a white person in power is enough to influence his followers to inflict disdain towards ethnic minority groups. This disdain translates into action when laws and decisions are made in favor of white people and against people of color ultimately permitting white privilege.\nA second modern day example would be in healthcare. Racial health disparities are the differences in statistics between white and nonwhite individuals with mortality, health insurance coverage and access to healthcare facilities. The article, An Empirical Analysis of White privilege, Social Position and Health discuses a study done on predominantly White neighborhoods of differently social class. The purpose behind the study was to determine if there was a correlation between health and inequality. The speculation comes from the fact that predominantly white neighborhoods typically have access to healthful resources while black neighborhoods feature sources that are detrimental to one\u2019s health such as liquor stores and even fast-food chains. Therefore, the experiment done through survey questions, would determine if predominantly white neighborhoods experienced better health on the basis of economic status and neighborhood diversity. \nThe study found that in some respects there was a decreased welcome for black residents in the neighborhoods when it came to having high dentalcare and healthcare (Kwate, Goodman 2014). The article concluded that in doing the experiment, participants form the lesser diverse neighborhoods may not have answered truthfully about how welcoming their neighborhood would be towards black people due to their personal knowledge on how likely it realistically is for a black family to move in. Furthermore, the question of whether the participants were answering because they and their neighbors acknowledge the existence of racism is still questionable. The experiment not only showed the prominence of better healthcare for racially exclusive communities, but also that there is ignorance on the part of the white neighbors in terms of how welcoming their neighborhoods are to black people, given that there was only a small population of black people living in each of the neighborhoods.\nAcknowledgement is a crucial part in abolishing white privilege because it first brings the issue to light and allows those involved to put a stop to it.\u00a0As Peggy McIntosh mentions in White Privilege: Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack, \u201cAs we in Women\u2019s Studies work to reveal male privilege and ask men to give up some of their power, so one who writes about having white privilege might must ask, \u201chaving described it, what will I do to lessen or end it?\u201d (McIntosh 1988).\u00a0It is not enough for people of color to speak out on their own struggles. It is crucial for white citizens as well to hold themselves and their peers accountable. For as long as the United States has dealt with racism and the existence of white privilege, it is evident that the issue needs to be addressed from the inside. As Dr. McIntosh explains, while they were not being actively racist, they grew up unaware of how society catered to them as a white individual. By simply educating oneself and passing the same information along, white citizens can help advance and secure the social rights for POC. This would guarantee them fair opportunities at improved physical health, education, job opportunities and overall safety. This country was originally designed with only White people in mind; therefore, the former laws and practices have become outdated with the increasingly diverse population. U.S citizens of all ethnic backgrounds must share the collective effort of speaking out on racial discrimination and holding oneself accountable for benefiting off of racial privilege if we want to coexist in a peaceful America.\n\n\n\nReferences\nBlacksher, E., & Valles, S.

        "text": "SOC 105\n28 April 2021\nAI Takeover \n\tTechnology is on the rise in today\u2019s modern world, aiming to conquer and work its way deeper into the everyday lives of human beings. There will always be technological advancements in the works. Whether those are the brand new smartphones expected to hit stores, a smart home that can fully function on its own, or self driving and flying vehicles. But as Apple continues to release a brand new phone every year, and Dubai now only has to perfect their already mastered idea of a self-flying helicopter, there is an even bigger advancement that also grows by time: Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence or AI has in fact been around for quite some time. Behind doors, scientists experiment, build, and test new structures including AI\u2019s in order to release them into the world. Artificial Intelligence is being designed to properly mimic and recreate algorithms in everyday functions of humans. AI\u2019s take science, formulas, chemical makeups, and neurological discoveries into consideration in order to replicate the basic functions necessary, and then work to expand those with hopes of mastering them. Many people applaud the possibility of artificial intelligence. AI\u2019s can offer a high quality of help and aid in basic tasks they are programmed for. As AI\u2019s can be deemed helpful, there is still a threat they pose to the evolving world. If artificial intelligence systems are allowed to grow into most societies, the need for work performed by regular humans will no longer be a necessity, leading to a world that can be controlled and ruled by engineered intelligence.  With AI\u2019s invading the routine system society has made for themselves, issues are bound to occur, even if artificial intelligence systems could improve areas significantly. \n\tWhen it comes to artificial intelligence systems, people automatically think robots. Although robots are a large part of AI\u2019s, there is a much more complex and intricate network to the AI name. Artificial intelligence is the promising replication of human thoughts and interactions that will be incorporated into AI systems used to take the place of human beings. Areas such as the workforce, government, medical fields, and basic everyday life will soon be affected by the rise of artificial intelligence if not done so already. Behind the scenes of AI systems are often not considered. In order for these AI\u2019s to be brought to life, scientists must figure out how to master the Polyheirarchich Model of Intelligence as described in Keith Stearne\u2019s article \u201cThe Polyheirarchich Model of Intelligence: A Critique of the Future of Intelligence Biological and Artificial.\u201d Stearne states that the way scientists have previously been creating these complex systems is through general strategic coordination which is achieved through \u201cthe mechanism of a \u2018zone of highest general connectivity\u2019 which moves round the strategic region, partly under the direction of the appetitive system, providing the necessary extra input to trigger selected potential responses in the motorium to the current sensory input\u201d (Stearne 158). Scientists have to first figure out how the human brain functions, and responds to actions and demands. With that knowledge a similar electronic system must be created and then programmed to act the same way. As this is the basis for artificial intelligence, scientists must follow up and incorporate feelings and other human functions in order to properly replicate human functionality. Yuval Noah Harari, an Israeli historian, notes in his book 21 Lessons for the 21\u2019st Century that society \u201cusually [fails] to realize that feelings are in fact calculations, because the rapid process of calculation occurs far below our threshold of awareness\u201d (Harari). Once again scientists must come to properly understand the way the body and mind functions, including when dealing with emotions and other important human ideals. Overall it comes down to the mastering of biology and anatomy before artificial intelligence can properly be mastered to where it is authentic and useful. \n\tIn the world of science, artificial intelligence has always peaked raging interest. As the years go on, the idea of an artificially intelligent world is starting to appeal to everybody. According to Joshue Eckroth in his article \u201cEvolution of a Robust Artificial Intelligence System: A Case Study of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence\u2019s AI-Alert\u201d even \u201cthe popularity of #artificialintelligence Twitter hashtag has grown so much that now AITopics\u2019 news content is strongly dominated by stories posted on Twitter\u201d (Eckroth 27). This shows that the idea of artificial intelligence is on people's minds, and growing popular by the minute. The appeal is the general idea of what AI\u2019s can do. In the article \u201cHuman Digital Thought Clones: The Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence for Big Data\u201d written by Jon Truby and Rafael Brown, it is expressed \u201cWhen humanity\u2019s unquenchable thirst for understanding human behaviour, decision making, and the human mind are coupled with economic incentives, the idea of a digital thought clone is not surprising\u201d (Truby & Brown 167).  It is the general idea of a different and technological society that draws the public into praising and recommending the increase in AI\u2019s. As interesting as the idea of robots running around Earth, and functioning the way humans do is, people must look at the future outcome of supporting the rise of artificial intelligence before fully supporting it. \n\tThere are a lot of speculations regarding the future of artificial intelligence. As there is no sure outcome of what could come out of the widespread use of AI systems, the possibilities should still be heavily considered. For starters, \u201cAn individualised digital thought clone can be used first to predict how a person would behave in a given set of parameters based on very precise behavioural patterns\u201d (Truby & Brown 147). The human mind has already been studied enough for scientists to mimic the functionality into intricate softwares. With knowledge of the human behavioral patterns and how the human mind reacts to certain situations, the basic human algorithm can be completely replicated to where future generations could be shaking hands with robots that will easily be mistaken for real human beings. Eckroth states in his article that \u201cAI algorithms and models trained by ML are often highly tuned to the specific nature of the data on which the algorithm was developed and model was trained\u201d (Eckroth 25). What Eckroth is telling us is that AI\u2019s have been and will continue to be created for specific reasons and for tackling certain objectives. In the future, an AI could easily be created for anything desired, which will eventually work its way into the workforce and take important tasks from real human beings. \nYuval Noah Harari describes the future of AI\u2019s best. Dedicating half a chapter to the current and future development of artificial intelligence, Harari notes how \u201cOnce AI makes better decisions about careers and perhaps even relationships, our concept of humanity and of life will have to change\u201d (Harari). The way society will need to function in the future will soon revolve around AI technology. So much that Harari also states \u201cWhen the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can, and then authority will probably shift from humans to computers\u201d (Harari). If artificial intelligence continues to grow more popular, the future might be strictly run off of AI systems in mostly AI environments. This is not as beneficial or amazing as it seems. As the work put into designing such systems is ordinary and interesting, the increase of a computerized society can give the government more ways to control us. Harari says \u201cAs algorithms come to know us so well, authoritarian governments could gain absolute control over their citizens..\u201d (Harari). If the book Nineteen Eighty-Four has ever been read, the future of AI systems can be compared to what George Orwell wrote. A computer could eventually be used to monitor everyday actions, thoughts, and words from citizens. This type of control is exhausting and violates privacy that citizens are promised in the U.S Constitution. But the possibility of a \u2018Big Brother\u2019 scenario due to AI\u2019s taking over society is not the only problem that could be faced.\nEvery artificial intelligence system starts somewhere. A team or specialist has to be the one to make the effort to bring one of these ideas to life. What if the one in control means harm? The AI to come from a creator with mal intention will start numerous issues and pose a risk to mankind. According to Harari, \u201cThe real problem with robots is not their own artificial intelligence, but rather the natural stupidity and cruelty of their human masters\u201d (Harari). As AI\u2019s start to populate more than ever, people need to be aware of the bad that can come from the wrong hands. If AI\u2019s can be programmed to be useful, they can most definitely be programmed to cause harm and fear. \u201cAny AI system that processes human generated content must be carefully watched because people will often find ways to influence the system\u201d says Joshua Eckroth (Eckroth 27). There will always be somebody with the mal intention of harming society. This gives them a sense of power and supreme priority over others. If systems can be hacked now, then AI systems can risk being hacked as well. It could only take one bad person to create an AI that will endanger society, and there will not be a way to know that until it is too late. As Keith Stearne says in his article, \u201cwe could never know for sure whether or not intelligent beings we create \u2018self-aware\u2019 as we are, especially if their construction is radically different from our own\u201d (Stearne 157). Scientists may be able to understand the human genome well enough to replicate it, but once AI\u2019s start to populate, there won\u2019t be enough knowledge from regular citizens to notice wrong behavior fast enough to stop it. They most likely won't know how to stop it. Not only would this increase the risk of harm, but it can also lead to many other complications. Harari believes \u201cthe philosophical algorithms will never be perfect. Mistakes will still happen, resulting in injuries, deaths, and extremely complicated lawsuits\u201d (Harari). On top of injuries and pain, AI\u2019s can lead to possible lawsuits that will stress out and mess up a lot of people's lives. Lives of people who might not have wanted or approved for AI\u2019s to be so heavily incorporated into everyday life, either. If the strength of the argument for Artificial Intelligence increases, it could potentially end up that artificial cloning of one person will slowly become less of a choice, and more of a demand. Keith Stearne also makes a point to say that he personally would not be happy if a replica of himself were cloned and created into an AI (Stearne 157). The arguments against the increasing popularity of AI systems are powerful, but it would be wrong to ignore the potential benefits.\nAs Harari mainly talks about the downfalls of an artificially intelligent future, he also brings up some good viewpoints on how society can be benefitted from AI systems. He starts off by saying \u201cthere is no reason to assume that algorithms won\u2019t be able to outperform the average human even in ethics\u201d (Harari). It is no secret that when given the chance, AI systems can and will outperform humans in the work given. This is the biggest argument for Artificial Intelligence, as it does limit the possibility for work that will not be completed to its fullest potential. It can also limit labor costs as AI\u2019s can handle more than one person's work at a time, but it is important to note that this will take away possible jobs for people who need them. Another interesting argument Harari brings up, is that AI\u2019s could reduce discrimination in scoeities. \u201cIf we allow a computer to evaluate job applications, and program the computer to completely ignore race and gender, we can be certain that the computer will indeed ignore these factors\u201d (Harari). The idea of programming and using AI\u2019s to ignore race and gender when making decisions will indeed limit the amount of dicrimination that takes play currently. Harari also compares AI systems to the future of war. By replacing soldiers with AI robots, the main goal of a soldier will be carried out proficiently with little error. By error, Harari is talking about the previous cases where soldiers have not been able to control their rage and go off on unnecessary killing and rape sprees. \u201cSince robots have no emotions, they could be trusted to always adhere to the dry letter of the military code, and never be swayed by personal fears and hatred\u201d (Harari). By using robots in these settings, there would be limited defiance and risk of violent outbursts that will negatively impact the world.\nIt is hard to hear about the incorporation of AI\u2019s into everyday life and side against it. These technological advancements have the potential to do good in society, but when weighing all the negative outcomes to the positive ones, it is clear that a future mostly run by AI\u2019s is not a future worth encouraging. There is too much of a risk of a controlled world that will come from the increase in AI usage and demand. People could also end up hurt in irreversible or non-curable ways. AI\u2019s could also lose control any minute with no way of knowing how to properly handle those situations. AI\u2019s could even be programmed to negatively lose control and harm others. In the end, it is better for society to continue to operate with manual labor as done now. If freedom is promised in the land of America, the threat to our freedom and privacy should be annihilated. Artificial intelligence systems should not be allowed to take control of the world. \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nEckroth, J. (2020).

        "text": "Second Graded Essay\n\n\tWhen reading and understanding \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations Durkheim'' and realizing humans have this collective consciousness might be a little intimidating for some. So in the reading \u201cThe Matrix of Domination\u201d thinking white people look at African American women as being a subordinate: do you think this just happened naturally? Or was it a societal thought which evolved into collective consciousness. \n\t\u201cBy objectifying African American Women and recasting our experiences to serve the elite white men, much of the Eurocentric masculinist fosters Black women's subordination\u201d. To think white people have been taught to look down upon another sex as less than but a race also might not sit well with most Americans. While these not only women but men were oppressed in history on disgusting levels we have to understand why? This happened because of something bigger. I'm not talking about physically enslaving people to gain wealth but let's look into the brain. \n\tIn \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations Durkheim\u201d we learned a quick overview of collective consciousness. This has caught my attention on every reading, lecture and essay we have done at some point. Racism is taught. Prejudice is taught. Hate is mostly taught, because I feel you can develop hatred feelings towards things later once the brain has developed. What i'm trying to say in all of this is our collective consciousness has been the downfall of civilization since we can recall. Starting in North America with Christopher Columbus, looking at his journal and him saying We could take this land and enslave these people, because of their ignorance in western civilization. That was over five hundred years ago and it was seeded into the brains of humans then and was passed down generation by generation. \n\tCollective consciousness is the reason for genocide, slavery, racism and all terrible things humans have done. It is also terribly good. With giving one morals of how they are raised. So when they are faced with right and wrong decisions they know how to feel and how to decide. Humans can be evil. But I hope we have learned from history and are passing down new morals to give the next generations a better collective consciousness. ",

        "text": "Landry Freeze\nSociology 105\n18 October 2021\nSurveillance in Relation to Human Behaviors\nHave you ever felt like you were being watched through your technological devices? Most individuals who live in America use a wide variety of electronics and most of the devices include some type of surveillance. In today\u2019s world of technology advancements, it is a common feeling for tech users to sense they are being watched constantly and almost always under some type of surveillance. Foucault proposed an experiment in a prison that allowed him to focus on prisoners and their behaviors through a control mechanism. I argue that surveillance has a strong connection with the behaviors of humans. The monitoring presence can even control the way people act in a negative way.\nSurveillance monitors are found in numerous different types around the world in a variety of locations. One of the most common examples of monitors is security cameras. Security cameras are found in almost all grocery stores, banks, parking decks and common spaces. The cameras can be visible to the human eye or completely hidden. Homeowners have access to purchase house cameras for the inside and outside of their home. The cameras specialized for a home can be created to connect to an iPhone, they can be wired directly into a house, be wireless or battery powered. Computers, iPhones, and cars are also monitors that are connected to a camera of some sort. \nCameras can be super beneficial and helpful in some cases. For example, cameras are useful in places of business if stealing occurs. The recordings from the cameras are often used as evidence for police officers in many different situations. Most security cameras can also pick up on voices in the recordings. Customers who are aware that cameras are in an area of a store may act different or try to conform to normal actions because they realize they are being watched. A con that elaborates on this example could be that the customers are conforming to the norm and not showing their true personality since they are on camera.\n Another large issue that exists with the significant amount of security cameras being installed is that people no longer have privacy in their lives. Humans are constantly being watched on surveillance in some way, shape or form. I have experienced a form of surveillance in my personal life with my smart phone. One day I was shopping in Old Navy, and I found a sweater that I wanted to purchase. The second I walked outside of the store and looked on my Facebook account there was an Old Navy ad on my page for the exact same sweater that I had just purchased. I immediately felt like I was being watched and that people were listening to me speak as I shopped and looked around the store. I have experienced several other incidents like this story with ads popping up on my computer of the exact same item that I previously had searched for. \nDo you ever wonder where the idea of surveillance becomes too much? Adults and teenagers can be spied on through their cameras on the technological devices that they use. I find it very creepy and invasive that people can watch us at any given time. An article online mentioned that trackers can collect data about a user. The data can include the users phone number, email address, street address and the IP address that is connected to the Internet. Trackers are even able to access the precise location of a user. The information that trackers can find is very personal therefore it is frightening that they are able to easily get into human\u2019s phones. \nBehaviors of people change when they feel like they are being watched. Surveillance over abnormal behavior is one of the topics we focused on in Sociology. Studies have shown that people may try to change their behaviors to fit what the social norms are when they are under surveillance. People also may try to act more kind than they usually are because they are wanting to make a good impression to the people who are watching them. \nSocial media makes it very accessible for people to play different roles and to not show their true self and who they are in real life. Many social media platforms create negativity because they portray images that seem to be perfect, and all put together. Their images were created with filters to cover up all their imperfections and it only shows a highlight reel of their daily life. This connects to the idea of being different from expectations constituting a ground for punishment. Many people are worried that if they stand out or look different then they will be put down and made fun of. \n\tSocial media influencers are a great example of a person trying to change their behaviors to fit a social norm. Influencers spend a generous amount of time picking out different outfits, finding locations to take pictures and planning out their next Instagram post or Tik-tok video that they are going to create. People who are influencers on Instagram or YouTube often change their self-identity to represent for a brand so that they can make money. Privacy can be difficult to achieve for people who are social media influencers because in order to influence people you must show your life to the world. Influencers post blogs and videos that go into many details about their personal life. Hackers are also more likely to be able to get influencers information because in most cases their accounts are made public so they attract a higher amount of viewers. \n\tVideo surveillance is also used to show abnormal behaviors. Abnormal behaviors can be behaviors that are described as uncultured or different than the normal standard behavior. A term that explains this particular behavior would be \u201cdeviance\u201d. Deviance can be defined as a behavior that does not conform to norms and expectations. Society is often so afraid to act in a way that does not fit the social norms. Many people believe that every person should dress the same way, have the same style, and act the same. Deviance can change depending on what activities and interests become popular for a specific year or what is relevant to culture. Finally, deviance is determined by the social context that it is used in. \nSurveillance is predominantly used to control the behaviors of people. Behaviors that are being watched can become more under control in a way. Foucault experienced behavior control through the experiment that he proposed. A \u201ccontrolling mechanism\u201d is a sophisticated way of describing Foucault\u2019s theory that he experienced through observing the prison. The design technique that was instilled in the prison was called \u201cPanopticon.\u201d This layout forced the prisoners to be spread out and away from each other. While the experiment was taking place there was no time for communication or interacting with others. During the experiment the guards of the prison were able to see inside each cell because they were centered at a tower that had a high viewpoint. The entire experiment allowed Foucault to focus on systems of social control and people in disciplinary situations and how they react. Lastly, he was able to study the \u201cpower-knowledge concept.\u201d\nFoucault describes the \u201cpower-knowledge concept\u201d as, the more a person observes a particular situation the more knowledge they will gain. Therefore, having more knowledge and background information about a circumstance can make people feel like they have more power. He also found through his experiment that there is a penetration of power that comes through to individuals. While there are many mechanisms for observation of humans, power definitely becomes more systematic as more knowledge is gained. Oppression also is a fear that is in place when only specific groups of people understand knowledge. Most people like to find out who is watching them on a camera or even who is listening to the recordings. Knowing who is watching people can make humans feel like they know who is in control and they can understand which people have authority and power. \nPower can be a difficult topic to speak about for humans because we do not always have control and authority over our lives. Most people have probably been in a situation in their life where they felt as if they had no control over a circumstance. This feeling can be uncomfortable, scary, sad and can even cause anxiety for many people. While the idea of surveillance over humans lives is not going to dissapear it is important that people realize they do not have to conform to the norms of society. Our whole scope of our life can be potentially under watch but we can still have originality and a want to be different than others and to stand out in life. \nIn conclusion, surveillance strongly relates to the behaviors and the way people act when they are being watched. Being different from what is expected can often constitute grounds for punishment, but it does not always have to be this way. Society has made surveillance over behaviors a normal and accepted part of life. People are so used to being under surveillance, being watched and conforming to the norms of society that it is so comfortable for them. Often people want to do exactly what other people are doing because they fear trying something new and possibly failing at meeting the standards of society. They also may be scared to dress differently or to behave in a way that most people do because other people may not accept them. I would like to challenge the readers to standout, make a difference in the world and try to not conform to the ways of the world. Strive to show positivity in your daily life because negativity can be tiring and draining to you and the other people around you. Always remember that it is beneficial to show others kindness, love others and to not let surveillance control your life behaviors in a negative way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "4929\nThe Domination Over the Collective Consciousness by the Power Elite\n\tWithin the realm of the American market, there will always have to be those in higher standards of power due to the highly neoliberal structure of the United States. It is said that those with money have power over the minds of consumers, and therefore the collective consciousness that resides within the everyday consumer. The amount of influence the Power Elite has over consumers collective consciousness\u2019 has allowed them to manipulate market trends and have dominance over the media and consumer propaganda.\n\tThe Power Elite, the semi-minority group of CEO\u2019s and high wealth individuals naturally find themselves with lots of voice in the media and society as a whole. Their large net worth legitimately allows them to do more things than the average middle-class citizen. And because of this inherent power they already have, oftentimes that is abused to gain them even more profits and market share. Most trends in social media that are related to the market are more often than not due to the influence of the Power Elite whether it\u2019s tons of funding towards marketing or using their typically large follower base on social media platforms to shift the general consensus towards a desired ideology.\n\tThe collective consciousness is simply the shared beliefs and ideologies that reside within a certain group of people or an entire society. In a way, social media platforms can be seen as having their own collective consciousnesses, as the members that use those platforms all intake the same content that can influence their beliefs and views. And like social media, the capitalist market also has a collective consciousness that contains all the common interests of consumers and market trends at that time. This means that somewhere along the line someone or something must go in and usher their desired trends into the shared consciousness that those with less voice will have to intake and accept as the new trend.\n\tThis aforementioned group of people influence the collective consciousness within the market is none other than the Power Elite. Their immense amount of money and sheer power allows them to effortlessly manipulate and modify the collective consciousness to cast their intended visions onto most consumers who also find themselves inside this same collective consciousness. An example of this working is that those with lots of money can market a new product or service to the point where it\u2019s virtually impossible for consumers to not notice this new product. Now that the majority of consumers within that space are aware of this new product, it not only can render other products in that same space as \u201cworse\u201d or \u201cuseless\u201d, but it gains revenue for the Power Elite\u2019s that are on funding this market manipulation.\n\tOne example that is quite relevant to today\u2019s market is the newfound use of Artificial Intelligence in Big Tech\u2019s services like Google and Meta. This AI craze started when OpenAI released GPT3.5 as the ChatGPT service. This opened the window to endless possibilities for companies with lots of money to expand their regions into the AI space. Soon enough, Google created Gemini, their ChatGPT equivalent, and this now creates a dominance in the AI space by Big Tech companies. \nIt may seem unrelated, but the reason AI is related to the Power Elite and the collective consciousness is quite simple. It takes a lot of machinery and money to train AI models and market them, something which only these large Power Elite companies have access to. These large companies can now fund all this research and technology to increase their dominance in the AI space, and because AI is so common now in all products seen in the common consumer market, that means that the majority of this market is dominated by said Power Elite companies. Essentially this means that whatever these Power Elite says goes as nobody has the ability to have a counterview.\nA slightly different approach to this comparison between the two can be indirectly seen in the Barbie movie. The Barbie movie aimed to emphasize the oppression of women in modern day society and the normalization of the patriarchy. The interesting thing about this is that patriarchy nowadays is fueled by marketing techniques by the Power Elite who have lots of say and voice in the collective consciousness in society. So while the Barbie movie was indeed portraying the objectification of women and the patriarchy being the main influencer of that, the patriarchy is actually backed by the Power Elite\u2019s influence of this collective consciousness.\nThe Power Elite is so effectively able to influence consumers by basically shaping the collective consciousness to their desires at will. This means that all the advertising, trends, and lot of pop culture is sparked by the Power Elite wanting to shift the focus in their favor. Even if people disagree with them in their choices, the majority of people simply don\u2019t have enough money or power to have much of a say in the war against the greedy Power Elite vs. the consume collective consciousness. As morbid as this all seems, not all the Power Elite are bad, however it is often seen that with money and power comes corruption and manipulation. For the foreseeable future, the Power Elite will remain in dominance over the market and the collective consciousness that resides within it, which will continue to influence the minds and beliefs of all consumers.",

        "text": "High School and Conflicts with Feminism\nAlthough many people like to claim that feminism belongs in the past, there are many legitimate reasons why fighting for women\u2019s rights is a current and pressing issue. This discrimination starts young and continues to affect women throughout their lives. As a high school student, I want to discuss how stereotypes and bias influence young women enrolled in secondary schools. From a young age, girls are taught to be ashamed of their bodies and are shamed for using their power to assist themselves and others. Women are kept from working with each other towards a common goal. \n           Before diving into the sociological concepts that explain the prevalence of hegemonic masculinity and the toxic putting-down of young women, I need to explain my own experiences within an institution in my school. For all four years of high school, I have been a part of the Women\u2019s Empowerment through Education, or WEE, club. For the past two years, I have served as secretary of the school. Since I am very involved in this operation, and have been for quite some time, I have experienced many different types of discrimination. I have witnessed both men and women inside and outside the organization shame the club and put it down.\n           The first example I would like to speak of involves a feminine product drive that WEE Club put on, in partnership with a feminist club at another nearby high school. This drive was advertised as a feminine product drive and the posters listed the items that the club would be collecting. This included bras, tampons, pads, underwear, and other items for feminine hygiene. The plan was for all these items to be donated to a domestic violence shelter. Our advertiser hung up the posters and was called to the principal\u2019s office, along with our president. \nThey were told that we were not allowed to use certain words and descriptions in our advertising because of their \u201cgraphic nature.\u201d WEE club was ordered to take down all our signs as well as our donation boxes until we would change the posters to include less inflammatory language. Our principal argued that words such as tampon and bra would distract the young men in our school. He argued that boys may not have been introduced to the concept of a period, and therefore the language we were using was harmful. Since our club focused on feminism and women\u2019s empowerment, we fought back against this censorship. This refusal to change our wording caused the donation drive to be shut down completely. In comparison, our sister club was able to continue the fundraiser with the same wording as us. \nOne of the issues surrounding how young women are treated in high school is the ideas and opinions of the men surrounding them. Hegemonic masculinity creates in men the idea that women are weaker and less than. These ideas are approved by the continuous belief in hegemonic masculinity. Male teachers and administrative officers perpetuate the standard by treating female students differently than male ones. Because of the prevalence of hegemonic masculine ideas, types of harmful beliefs have bled into the collective consciousness. This incorrectly displays the thought that men are dominant, and women are subservient. A high school is a dangerous place because it is where these ideas become embedded in the minds of young students, both male and female.\nSimone de Beauvoir discusses many of the concepts that I will be discussing in her article titled \u201cWoman as Other.\u201d In this article the author debates how women are thought of as secondary to men, and what, if anything, can be done to combat this. De Beauvoir discusses how because a woman has ovaries and a uterus, she is inferior and subject to rule by the male. Men see their bodies and anatomy as normal and even empowering, whereas a woman\u2019s body is a prison. \n           Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s theory of women as others as well as the theory of hegemonic masculinity, explains my story of the principal banning the use of words such as period or tampon because it might harm young men\u2019s learning and thought processes. In this scenario, the principal thinks that he and his anatomy are superior and the baseline for how all bodies work. This explains his condescending behavior and belief that speaking or writing about menstrual cycles is inappropriate for a school setting. Speaking of bras and tampons breaks down the mental barrier of thought that creates the idea that women are held back by their anatomy. \n            Although I have witnessed and experienced discrimination based on sex by men, there are also many situations where the club faced barriers from other women. I would like to focus on a conflict with our teacher sponsor. Unfortunately, between my junior and senior year, our former teacher sponsor left the school and our club. My school is small, so we were left with a limited number of teachers to choose. We wanted a female representative that would be able to assist us and relate to our mission. We found a new female teacher representative and began my senior year. This female teacher was quite hard to work with and opposed us at every move. At the start of the year, we held meetings in her classroom, and she would argue with us the entire time. She fought against our feminist values and refused to help us in our mission to gain equality for all genders. Because of this teacher, we started losing members, and by the time the first semester had passed, we barely had any people attending our meetings. \n           Although this was annoying and unnecessary, the board was prepared for opposition. However, we were not prepared for what was going to happen next. Our teacher sponsor started trying to shut down our club because she did not believe in our mission or effectiveness. She talked with the principal without informing us and then shut down tbe club for a semester until we could \u201cget our act together.\u201d Our board tried everything from scheduling a meeting with the principal to holding meetings without the authority of our teacher sponsor, but we kept getting shut down. This is a prime example of how other women can oppose modern feminism and cause internal conflict within a movement. \n           This story concerning the teacher sponsor who tried to shut down the club can be explained through defensive othering and inequality between women. This is all discussed in the article titled \u201cBarbie Dolls on the Pitch\u201d by Matthew Ezzell. Ezzell discussed how in defensive othering, a person who is part of a devalued and discriminated group thinks that although certain stereotypes do belong to the group that they are a part of, they do not fit into the same characteristics. They use these thoughts to put themselves on a pedestal while perpetuating the stereotypes that have been forced onto the rest of the group. \n           Ezzell\u2019s article discussing hetero sexy fit and defensive othering play into women devaluing women in many ways. Our teacher sponsor saw that our club was beginning to struggle. Instead of focusing on working with the members and the board to improve the current conditions, she shed her identity as a fellow woman and feminist in favor of the winning side. She denounced the ideals that we were fighting for, which became very destructive to our club\u2019s survival. \n           My two personal experiences involving my high school principal and my teacher sponsor clarify sociological concepts such as hegemonic masculinity, woman as other, and defensive othering. These ideas create a harmful environment for young women in high school because they diminish the woman\u2019s identity and force her into submission. These ideas are so prevalent that young women will often create conflict within themselves, furthering the damage caused. This shame and control keep girls from realizing their full potential and coming into themselves. High school is still a toxic environment for young women, and much needs to be done to fix this. A first step is to understand the concepts that are inhibiting people from working together, and slowly breaking down barriers. Then, we can work towards making a more understanding and inclusive society.",

        "text": "Essay Brief 8\n3/29/2021\nHarari explains how societies across the globe have previously used religion as a basis of governing. They go into depth on how certain individuals, political groups and countries are very against the idea of liberalism and view it strictly as the opposite of being conservative. The author explains that it is more traditional to put faith in the law of higher and divine authority. This concept can be related to collective consciousness and the way in which one's ideals are based on their upbringing or environment. Harari writes, \u201cFor thousands of years people believed that authority came from divine laws rather than from the human heart, and that we should therefore sanctify the word of God rather than human liberty\u201d (Harari 58). This is a demonstration of collective consciousness within a time period. Religion is a global practice and has served as a method of governing in many nations throughout history. In The Cultural Logic of Collective Representations, Durkheim explains the religious order is the basis for both governing and cultural morals in some societies. The author writes, \u201cNow in order that these principal aspects of the collective life may have commenced by being only varied aspects of the religious life, it is obviously necessary that the religious life be the eminent form and, as it were, the concentrated expression of the whole collective life. If religion has given birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion\u201d (Durkheim 72).\u00a0\n\u00a0Through both readings, the answer as to why religion has been used in this way, is because it is one of the oldest forms of community that humans developed. People will find likeminded individuals through church or religious organizations. It allows them to have a safe space to express their ideals and lifestyle. However, religion being used to control citizens has been practiced for hundreds of years. Rulers and political figures will use the fear of God to instill order within a society. Even on a smaller scale, groups and clubs still practice this hierarchical order of having set rules and leaders. In the same way that it is in human nature to flock to those one relates to, we are also used to the ordered form of having a set person in charge that is above us. In religious households, it is God, and, in every household, it is our parental guardians and then our teachers, employers and so on. Unfortunately, religion in politics has created more harm than good in societies that practice it. This is due to the fact that modern societies are more culturally diverse. Therefore, one moral perspective cannot be used as law and enforced on all citizens. The ultimate solution to ensuring that everyone\u2019s beliefs and feelings are respected is in liberalism as Harari explains in chapter 3. It promotes taking feelings into account and not limiting citizens on the basis of personal beliefs.\n",

        "text": "Soc 105- 002\n29 Nov. 2021 \nReligion and Work in the 21st Century\n\tIn his book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari analyzes many different aspects of society and provides his input on why he believes they either contribute to or diminish aspects of society. Some of his ideas include ideas about religion, Artificial Intelligence (AI), terrorism, and many more. He provides an interesting perspective on these ideas and goes into depth about each one. Two of Harari\u2019s main points are about religion and its effect on societal issues and the role it plays in society as well as the work ethic/ introduction of AI into society and how that changes the way people work. Both topics are commonly talked about in sociology, as well as in the readings we did in class. Those are the topics that will be focused on throughout this essay. \n\tDurkheim, Maryanski, and Turner evaluate the essence of religion in our earliest time in society. Together, they analyze the point that religion was needed in society to develop emotional intelligence, cognitive ability, and the fundamental categories of thought as well as forming the first social groups in society. Religion played a key role in forming the fundamental categories of thought in our society by forcing the earliest humans to form their own beliefs about something and create a structure in which to live their lives. Durkheim describes this concept as collective effervescence. Religions were created from this fundamental category of thought since multiple people believed in the same ideas. Once they formed these religious ideas, social groups were then formed based off religious beliefs and understandings. This helped to shape society in the earliest time because people were put into social groups and social standings which in turn created social hierarchies. In the earlier periods of society, this was important because it created structure, showed people the \u201cway of life\u201d, and basically told them where they belonged in society. Over time, religious social groups have been questioned as to whether they help society or hurt it. \n\tHarari believes that these religious groups have over time hurt society and caused hostility within it, leading to conflict and instability. While Harari does agree with Durkheim, Maryanski, and Turner that religion does create social groups and hierarchies in a society, he does not agree with the idea that they are necessary or beneficial for a society in the twenty-first century. On page 138 of his book, he states that \u201cunfortunately, all of this [issues within religion and economic problems] really makes traditional religions part of humanity\u2019s problem, not part of the remedy.\u201d He elaborates on this by stating that religions have been turned to be used against the people in government, rather than for the people. They are used to separate people, not unify them. This is where he would begin to disagree with Durkheim, Maryanski, and Turner because they believed that religion was a necessary part of society to create structure. While Harari wouldn\u2019t completely disagree with this, he also wouldn\u2019t completely agree. He states that, \u201c\u2026nationalism and religion still divide our human civilization into different and often hostile camps.\u201d Harari believes that religion has been turned into a negative construct that causes hostility rather than a unifying subject in society. However, he does say that religion isn\u2019t all negative because it can help country leaders to make economic decisions based on their belief systems. Harari would probably disagree with Durkheim, Maryanski, and Turner in their broad idea that religion is a positive aspect of society because he believes that overall, it causes more negativity in society than it does positivity. \n\tThe second commonly talked about idea in sociology is work. In Karl Marx\u2019s \u201cEstranged Labour\u201d, he states that work under capitalism is not beneficial to society because in time it causes people to give up their true self and be forced into labor. He says that they become forced to be a part of competition rather than working for themselves, like they used to in earlier times of society. Because of the competition created by work under capitalism, people tend to lose their true identity and work ethic. They work for societal approval, rather than approval by themselves and their belief system. He would also say that the nature of human beings has become unique because people almost willingly give up themselves and their beliefs to fit into society and become a product of labor under capitalism. Marx states that over time, this causes alienation within a society and withing your essence of self because people give away their happiness and true self to fit in with the ideas of capitalism and work under capitalism. \n\tHarari believes something like Marx, but not because of capitalism. In his book, Harari discusses the future of labor due to the implementing of Artificial Intelligence systems in our society. He attempts to warn the reader that AI systems will take away jobs and take away motivation to work. Harari believes that once AI systems can take over jobs, this will cause panic and chaos because people won\u2019t have to work anymore. This in turn will lead to a lack of motivation and the want to work. On page 55, Harari states, \u201cOnce AI makes better decisions than we do about careers and perhaps even relationships, our concept of humanity and of life will perhaps have to change.\u201d This is an important idea to bring up because this summarizes Harari\u2019s main point of AI\u2019s and the work environment in society. A good example from class that relates to this view is the Jarus video, which is about a family that allowed an AI system to completely control their lives, such as chores, locations, TV time, etc. Harari would not support this lifestyle because the children will be raised to believe everything is done for them and they can rely on an AI system about when to do certain things and what is right and wrong. If the AI systems are implemented into society in this type of way, no one will be able to think for themselves anymore, causing their true self to be the \u2018true self\u2019 of the AI system, not their own. \n\tWhile Harari and Marx discuss different aspects of work in society, they have similar or complementary beliefs about societies view of work. In Marx\u2019s viewpoint, he believes that humans have lost their true selves while working under capitalism. In Harari\u2019s viewpoint, he believes that humans will have to reevaluate their sense of self if AI\u2019s take over human jobs. These viewpoints are similar and complementary because both change the sense of self that humanity has and will cause a huge shift in society. Marx would say that capitalism caused the shift in the sense of self of society and Harari would say the same about AI\u2019s. Both believe that these interferences in society led to negative outputs rather than positive outputs. They would also both say that the work in society should not be influenced by these factors because society will not be the same with this occurring. If the true self of the people is put at risk, humanity will completely change and not be able to turn around to revert to the old ways of the work force. \n\tHarari would support the concept of work brought about by Marx but not the concept of religion brought about by Maryanski, Turner, and Durkheim for a few reasons. For one, the concept of Marx is more modernized, and Harari continuously suggests lessons throughout his book to try to prepare us for the future of the twenty-first century. Marx\u2019s idea about work in society is like Harari\u2019s because he relates it to what can happen in the future. The idea about religion by Maryanski, Turner, and Durkheim doesn\u2019t necessarily grow with the future of society, but rather acts as one idea over time. They\u2019re idea about religion doesn\u2019t provide a modern viewpoint and suggests one main idea, rather than relating it to the future of society or modernizing it to how society is today. This makes a major impact on Harari not fully agreeing with their stance on religion because his stance relates more to the current and future impacts of society. \n\tIn conclusion, while Harari does not completely agree with the ideas brought about by Durkheim, Marynaski, and Turner regarding religion, he would agree with the ideas brought about by Marx regarding the work system in society. Harari believes that religion is not completely benefitting society, and in the long run could damage the way that society works because it creates hostility and negative social groups in our society. He also believes that the work system in society could be completely damaged by AI\u2019s, which in turn would damage the idea of our true self and would cause our true self to be thoughts created by an algorithm program rather than our own thoughts. Harari brings many interesting points into common ideas discussed in sociology and causes readers to question ideas that they thought they stood firmly on. The sociologists mentioned (Durkheim, Marx, Maryanski, and Turner), all have very sound and traditional views on society, while Harari comes in to question these sound views and provide a more updated side to them. Harari questions these views in an effort to predict and assist humanities future and provide a modern stance on many issues and situations occurring in society. Overall, Harari would agree with many perspectives of sociologists, however, also would disagree, and challenge many perspectives of sociologists, which is not traditionally seen in society nowadays. \n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDurkheim, Emile. \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation.\u201d The Two Sides of Society, 1912, file:///Users/traceyfisher/Downloads/The%20Cultural%20Logic%20of%20Collective%20Representations%20Durkheim-1%20(3).pdf. \nHarari, Yuval N. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

        "text": "Sociology 105- 002\n18 Oct 2021\n\nReflection Essay 1\nHave you or someone you know ever questioned religion or what religion means to you? I have. Religion is something that many people consider a top priority in their lives. It gives people a way to frame their morals and a way to direct the choices that they make throughout their lives. It can act as a pathway to guide your life. However, religion is something that many people also question. People who are very religious and grounded by religion can sometimes judge those who question religion or aren\u2019t as grounded by it. This idea was something I was worried about when I began to question religion. My whole life I was surrounded by family and friends who put religion as one of the top priorities in their life. They questioned me when I began to ponder the importance of religion in my own life.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Religion is one of the founding principles of sociology and arguably is one of the biggest influences in one\u2019s life; from day-to-day conditions to pathways in which one guides their life. Religion throughout the timeline of society has continuously developed and gained more and more importance. At the beginning of society, religion helped shape language and create social groups as well as being something that didn\u2019t make you lesser-than or different than someone else. Currently, religion still creates social groups but can also play a role in the creation of stereotypes and in \u201cothering\u201d people who don\u2019t have the same beliefs as you may. In earlier periods of society, religion was more important to define social groups than it currently is now\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Religion has been an important aspect of society for centuries and continues to grow with society as society develops. You may be wondering why religion is so important and what exactly religion has done for society. In present-day society, there are many different religions as well as different groups formed out of a broader religion. For example, Christianity has many different branches. There\u2019s Presbyterian, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many more. Most religions have different branches based on one broad idea. While each one has similarities, they are all separated by smaller beliefs that categorize people into groups of religion within a religion. Religion today has grown into something that is more than a personal belief; it is involved in government, politics, and protests. In the earlier periods of society, religion was something that was used to create languages and cognition as well as being used as a tool to create groups within a society. So, while religion has changed and developed over time, the founding principle of social group creation still exists.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the beginning of society, religion was analyzed as a tool that helped to create social groups and develop language and cognition. In the essay,\u00a0Neurology of Religion,\u00a0by Alexandra Maryanski and Jonathan H. Turner, they go into depth about the effects of religion in earlier society. They argue that religion helped to \u201cwork on a facility\u2026on the hominin brain to increase sociality and capacities for group formation among humans\u2019 ancestors. (Pages 113-114)\u201d Religion played an interesting role in organizing rituals and increasing religious behavior and social groups. The largest effect of religion as argued by Maryanski and Turner is the social group forming factor. In the period of society discussed in the essay, religion wasn\u2019t used in a group form to create social standards or stereotypes, but rather provide individuals with a proper place to fit into society. It helped to create a deeper level of cognition, and over time has changed into a way to be categorized in society.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As argued by Durkheim, religion \u201cprovides social cohesion to help maintain social solidarity through shared religious beliefs.\u201d This means that religion was a form of unity and played a major role in shaping society as we know it today. I believe that without the formation of religious groups, society would not be the same. Without the formation of religion, society wouldn\u2019t have a unifying factor that allowed people to find their social group and expand their beliefs. Religion acts as a form of expression, and that is one idea that hasn\u2019t changed as society has developed throughout the centuries.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Religion has continuously shifted throughout society. As stated previously, religion acted as a tool for the formation of social groups and aided in increasing cognition. Currently, religion still creates social groups, but in a different way than in earlier periods. My experience with religion hasn\u2019t always been smooth sailing. I grew up in a Christian household, with a mom who took my brother and I to church every Sunday and even some Wednesdays for small group studies. I also went to a Christian school from kindergarten to third grade. I didn\u2019t begin to question religion until I went through a traumatic experience. After this, I began to wonder why God would allow such a bad thing to happen to me and my family at such a young age, so I started looking into other religions or even into spirituality. I eventually settled on more of a belief of spirituality rather than a specific religion, and it was at first something very hard for my mother to understand. Once I voiced to her why I questioned it, however, she began to become more understanding and respect my new beliefs. I know quite a few people who have gone through something similar in regards to questioning religion and I think it is a very interesting thing to occur when someone begins to question it. While I do not belong to a specific religion when meeting and interacting with other spiritual people I feel that I am a part of a social group. This is something important to analyze because religions are very specific groups in society and if you don\u2019t fit into one of those groups, you can be seen as an outsider. I have only felt this way a few times, but for the most part, I do still feel like I belong to a group in society, whether or not religious people would view me as an \u201cother\u201d.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another major way that religion has shifted in society over time is through the way that it is used and how it affects people in society. While religion was once used as a tool for belonging in society, it is now used in government and politics as well as creating a sense of belonging in society. People in the government, as well as politicians, have come to realize the power that religion has over people, and have started using it against people in things like trying to gain a vote in an election. This is also something that I think is important to analyze because, in the earlier periods of society, religion was seen as a positive aspect of society that captured ones\u2019 beliefs and morals. While this is still true, it is also used as a tool against people in present-day society. Religion has gone from something with such a positive connotation to something with a slightly negative connotation.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I believe that religion was a more important aspect of society during the earlier time periods because it is now used as a tool against people, rather than something that solely helps to create social groups. As argued throughout the essay, religion does continue to aid in the creation of social groups, but often is not a positive thing and can push people to be considered \u201cothers\u201d of society if they do not agree with the majority of people\u2019s religious beliefs. The evidence that supports this is mainly involved with government and politics. People involved in the government now use religion as a way to get people to follow them, not as something that is ones\u2019 thoughts. It has shifted from being a social group created to a way to categorize people, but not always in a positive way. This is shown with my situation when I questioned religion and changed my religious beliefs from the ones\u2019 of my parents to my own beliefs. Much of my family still doesn\u2019t know that I do not belong to a specific religious group because they wouldn\u2019t support this change that I decided. I was very lucky to have supportive parents that don\u2019t think religion is the most important part of someones\u2019 life and that respected my new beliefs as I grew up and developed my own beliefs and morals. This is relevant in present-day society because as stated before, there have been more and more people who question their religious beliefs.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, I believe that religion has shifted throughout society to be something that hurts society more than it helps it. Society was built on the principles of individual thought, however, when someone begins to question religion society sees it from a negative point of view rather than a positive point of view. I also believe that religion should be something that people should be able to decide for themselves and not experience pressure from society to conform to a specific religion.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBoundless. \u201cBoundless Sociology.\u201d\u00a0Lumen, https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/the-functionalist-perspective-on-religion/.\nHistory.com Editors. \u201cChristianity.\u201d\u00a0History.com, A&E Television Networks, 13 Oct. 2017, https://www.history.com/topics/religion/history-of-christianity#section_13.\nMaryanski, Alexandra, and Jonathan H.

        "text": "5071\nCapitalism's Effect on Marxist Theses\nCapitalism is a system based on\u00a05\u00a0core principles: private property, supply & demand, competition, freedom, and incentive. Private property can be anything from something physical like a house to something intangible like a patent or a brand. Supply & demand is the economic system put into place where there is a direct relationship between a price and how much is produced based on sales. Competition is related to the working field and any other possible jobs\u00a0in which\u00a0the best people rise to the top.\u00a0Everyone wants to be at the top\u00a0so\u00a0it\u00a0is a constant struggle\u00a0to get there.\u00a0Freedom\u00a0is connected to a person's right to autonomy and choices. Finally, incentive regards\u00a0to\u00a0profit and making people strive to get that profit. People and companies will work harder and be more innovative and efficient to achieve that improved profit. A society that exists of these\u00a05\u00a0aspects is a self-serving one. People within the society are encouraged to be independent and look out for themselves so that they can compete to be on top.\u00a0This\u00a0makes a series of impersonal exchanges and an excess of intangible assets. The depersonalization of an economy and those within it go hand-in-hand with McDonaldization and Rationalization. Both systems rely on anything but humanity and interpersonal communication. Though Capitalism has more equity\u00a0seeing\u00a0the more you wear\u00a0the\u00a0more you get, it does have the habit of developing systems in which people do not interact. Isolation is a\u00a0key\u00a0component of Capitalism.\u00a0\nMarxism\u00a0mixed with\u00a0Capitalism\u00a0finalizes\u00a0the concept\u00a0that isolation is inevitable when people\u00a0are exposed\u00a0to the\u00a05\u00a0pillars of Capitalism.\u00a0The Marxist idea that humans are so susceptive to change based on\u00a0what they are surrounded by\u00a0makes Capitalism the key to coding someone's manner and habits.\u00a0Each of the five pillars affects social habits\u00a0in different ways, but competition and incentives are more likely to cause isolation and self-serving behavior. Competition causes people to\u00a0directly\u00a0go up against one another and struggle to get to the top. There can only be so many on top, so it causes tension and individualism.\u00a0Incentive has many forms, money, success, and\u00a0any\u00a0other kinds of profit\u00a0available.\u00a0So, different people will strive and improve things for\u00a0different\u00a0reasons, so what one person does for their incentive might oppose another person's way of receiving their incentive. The culmination of the two creates the ultimate individualist structure in this bigger society. Marxism is a smaller scale of a big society/economy where\u00a0people can be connected\u00a0to their work and surroundings more easily.\u00a0This\u00a0encourages a herd mentality and\u00a0community,\u00a0versus a competitive struggle to determine who will be on top.\nIn conclusion, human nature is easily changed and can be rewired based on the necessity to survive and thrive. Capitalism has specific aspects in which they can isolate all the natural survival instincts\u00a0to then cause\u00a0people to be more self-interested and individualistic. Though Capitalism is effective, it does oppose the groupthink aspect of social nature.\u00a0\n",

Introducing mind body duality and comparing it with having four different categories making up our brain are two different theories completely. Is one more correct or believable in their depiction of your brain?\nHaving a mind and body relationship and knowing which reaction you're having in your brain seems virtually self explanatory while material self, social self, personal identity and pure ego seem to compartmentalize the theory of our brain but doesn't touch on the body or our physical being. When mentioning material self and having a reaction to a family member or close friend being hurt for example; empathizing with them and wanting to help or do something to help would sound like a body reaction exactly how George is describing in his writings. Sounds like a body reaction to me. Is one more right than the other? Dun, Dun, Dun..\nIt's subjective, but the philosophy behind \u201cThe self, the I and Me\u201d help me understand the mind while relating to the body. For example while writing this essay and re-reading my sentences and thinking \u201cman that sounds dumb, im going to look like and idiot.\u201d But knowing he is a much more educated human than myself shows you how I am having mind duality and using both my I and Me brain.

        "text": "Equal Pay\n\tAre women and men truly being paid equally in current-day America? It would be easy to say the answer is yes, they are paid equally, especially after the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed and enforced, however, if you really dig deep into some companies you would be surprised to see this is not always upheld. While there are many different variables and circumstances that can play a role in a person's average income different studies have shown that women and men are in fact not paid equally at all companies. On average a woman completing the same job that a man is, holding the same level of degree, would only be paid about 80% of what that man would be paid. However, because of the vast number of variables that can affect a person\u2019s salary the issue regarding equal pay in America has not been an easy battle to fight. \n\tThe biggest misconception regarding equal pay discrimination is that it does not occur in America and only happens in other countries. Another common misconception about equal pay discrimination is that it only affects people who work full-time at large companies. Research has shown that the smallest gender pay gap is for both part-time and full-time workers between the ages of 25 and 34. Women who are between the ages of 25 and 34, on average, make 93 cents for every dollar that a man in this age group makes, whereas workers age 16+ (excluding ages 25-34) on average make 84 cents for every dollar a man of the same age makes. To make matters worse, Black and Latina women in America make even less than white women in America. \n\tMy mom\u2019s friend, who will be named Emily, experienced a similar situation except unlike me, Emily was working at her company full-time receiving a salary rather than hourly pay. Emily had been working at this company for 19 years when she got promoted from \u201cteam member\u201d to manager after her previous manager left. Her previous manager was a man who had only been with this company for about 5 years before he left. Emily had her master's, a higher degree in school than her previous manager who only had a bachelor's degree. When Emily got promoted to manager, she expected to be getting the same salary her previous manager did when he started working as a manager. This however was not the case. Emily found out she was making 30,000 dollars less than what her previous manager made annually, even though she had been at the company for 14 more years than he was and she even had a higher level of education than he possessed. Both of these situations go to show that not only do women who work full-time and receive a salary get discriminated against when it comes to equal pay, but part-time hourly pay workers do as well. \n\tDiscrimination against women regarding equal pay most of the time spawns from men who believe, or have been taught, that the male sex is more powerful and is placed higher than women in a social hierarchy. Brett G. Stoudt conducted research regarding hegemonic masculinity in an all-boys school to see if the lack of women and women as authoritative figures had an effect on the way these young boys viewed women. This study was taken place in an all-boys school called Rockport, located in an upper-middle to upper-class region. This study was distributed to 148 boys who attended Rockport. Hegemonic masculinity as described in this research paper is the idea and practice that validates the idea that men belong above women in a social hierarchy. Stoudt's research concluded that at Rockport hegemonic masculinity was taught and reinforced through their schooling curriculum. The effect of this on the teenage boys who attend this school was shown through a conversation with David and Brian, two boys who went to school at Rockport. Both David and Brian claimed they viewed girls as a mother or a friend because they were better at the emotional and caring aspects of life. This unfortunately places women in a subordinated position in these teenage boys' minds without them even realizing it. \n\tAs mentioned above the teaching of hegemonic masculinity is very common throughout society and plays a major role in the social hierarchy which places men above women. This hierarchy is one of the major issues that have caused this unequal pay between men and women. If I were to have had a female supervisor who was in charge of the hourly pay it is much more likely that I would have received the pay I was promised while I was being interviewed. There is a small chance that she would have started women lifeguards out at the base pay because she believed \u201cmen are stronger than women so in conclusion men are more capable and proficient in this job\u201d just like my male supervisor believed. \n\tThe discussion of equal pay amongst men and women has been an ongoing topic ever since the first wave of feminism. As the social hierarchy of men being placed above women has decreased so has the gap between the average pay of men and women, however, there is still a fairly large difference. Women making on average 93 cents for every dollar a man makes may not seem like a huge gap in pay, but over time this pay difference adds up. The average annual wage in America is about 51,916 dollars. If a man made that amount in a year a woman would only make around 48,281 dollars. That is a 3,635 dollar difference and when women have to raise children every dollar makes a difference in the mom's life and the child's life. The first step to abolishing this gap in pay is to get rid of the hegemonic masculinity and/or the idea that men are better and harder workers than women, so as result, they should be paid more. Once this idea has been erased from everyone's heads there will not be as noticeable of a gap in pay based on gender, it will be solely based on worth ethics, and experience as companies nowadays say it is.\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWord Count: 1643\t\t\t\t",

        "text": "The Beauty Truth\n\tWhy is physical appearance the main measurement of self-worth for the majority of women? Who decided that what a woman looked like determined how valued they would be within society? What enables the power difference between men and women within society? These questions and more have been asked over and over by women trying to come up with logical solutions to the disparities that they face compared to men. One logical reason is the idea that women\u2019s value is based more on what they look like versus their accomplishments in life. The \u201cideal woman\u201d is based on stereotypes that men place upon women. This idea is known as the beauty myth. To stop the perpetuation of these degrading standards, women need to take back their power by straying from these unrealistic beauty ideals. \n\tBeing a woman myself, I have experienced events of being looked down upon only because of the gender I am. There have been times when I have been mansplained only because I present as female. Or times when men think that I am incapable of doing something just because I am a girl. A common experience that I think many girls can relate to is not being picked on to stack chairs. Throughout school, I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up as many chairs as the boys or told that I was unable to do something because it was a \u201cboys\u2019 job.\u201d The girls are just supposed to sit around and \u201clook pretty\u201d while the boys do the \u201chard work.\u201d I remember always being mad because I knew that I could\u2019ve done anything the boys did. I just didn\u2019t understand how much being a girl and trying to \u201cfit in\u201d would affect me until I grew up. \n\tAs I aged and moved to the Northeast, I found myself being more and more worried about what I looked like. I had never really cared growing up because I had lived in Colorado where all the girls were just as much a tomboy as I was. They played outside just as much as I did. They wore baggy clothes and had dirt all over their faces after a day of playing just as I did. These normal experiences for me completely changed however when I moved to Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the beauty myth was in full effect. You didn\u2019t fit in with the girls unless you wore makeup, wore pink, and tried to impress the boys. This culture shock was a major change for me as I had never been a girly girl. I spent most of my life playing outside with my brother and his friends. Now, I was being forced to like playing with makeup, doing my hair, and wearing tighter clothes. \nThis ideal to look feminine has been prominent in my life ever since that time. I have felt the need to show off my body to get male attention. This concept is so disturbing as I am forced to wear uncomfortable clothing and gross makeup so that a guy will look at me two seconds longer than normal. It\u2019s, even more, overwhelming in college as it seems as though every girl is looking for male validation in any way they can. This has led to some of my friends not eating as much as they should or revealing too much of themselves so that guys can find them attractive. It\u2019s not only women in the real world who seem to act, dress, and just be for male validation. \n\tWomen in video games, tv shows, and movies all adhere to femininity for men. In video games, tv shows, and movies women are normally side characters. They are seen as the weak side characters who need the help of a big strong male character to fix their problems. They are also normally always dressed in a sexual way\u2014tight and revealing clothes. There are very few movies in which a female character is an independent woman who doesn\u2019t need a man to prove her worth. Even the ones that are produced and sent to movie theatres often do a lot worse with critics and with the overall money that they generate. Society doesn\u2019t like to see women who aren\u2019t living their lives with the intent of pleasing men.\nThe idea of women needing to feel beautiful to feel worthy/have value is known as the \u201cbeauty myth.\u201d This concept was introduced by Naomi Wolf in the 1990s. She explains that women are judged on their appearance which creates a societal standard affecting their behavior. This societal standard is enforced by men who want women to be a specific size, a specific shape, and act a specific way. By creating this structure of who and what women can be, men can stay in power. They can pin women against each other in an attempt to have women compete to prove who the \u201cperfect woman\u201d is. However, the problem is that there is no \u201cperfect woman.\u201d The concept is socially constructed. It isn\u2019t what women believe, but it is instead what is forced onto them through media. If the media shows skinny, (normally) white models then most women are going to try to obtain that same look. This is why plastic surgery, as well as the number of eating disorders, have shot up immensely after the introduction of social media. Women are trying to obtain bodies that will play into the male gaze with devastating consequences. \nI take this theory of the beauty myth and place it into the context of all of the experiences that I talked about earlier, we see an obvious connection. Girls from a young age are taught that men need to take care of them. They are too weak and small to do anything physical. Men are supposed to take care of them and protect them. Not only does this further perpetuate the beauty myth, but it also creates a corollary myth for men. If society believes that men are around to protect and take care of women, this creates pressure on men. They are taught to be tough, don\u2019t cry, and always be strong. This ideology adds to why toxic masculinity is such a prominent problem within our society. If men are measured by their possession of women, men with little to no women believe as though women owe them themselves. They are men and therefore get to \u201chave\u201d women. When women don\u2019t give in to this, men can become violent and aggressive toward women in general. \nIf we apply the concept of the beauty myth to my experience growing up, we can see the obvious correlation. As I got older, I felt the beauty myth placed upon me even more. I could feel that I wouldn\u2019t be seen as valuable to not only men but society as well if I didn\u2019t fit in the mold. I needed to be skinny, have my hair and makeup done, and behave appropriately toward men. If I didn\u2019t, I would be ostracized from society. Men wouldn\u2019t find me attractive; therefore, making me worthless. However, because I want to fit in with society, I decided to do my hair and makeup. I changed my appearance so men could find me appealing. I gave in to the beauty myth. \nWomen are forced to fit into unrealistic beauty standards in today\u2019s society to be seen as worth anything. We have to change ourselves in all ways both physically and mentally to fit the mold that the media and men place upon them. We have to fit the stereotypes that are perpetuated\u2014pretty and subservient to men. If I and other women want to escape from the abomination that is the beauty myth, we need to take back our bodies. We, collectively, need to stop giving in to the pressures of the media. We need to take back the power that was ripped away from us. Men have kept us away from male-dominated spheres like politics and STEM. They have placed women against each other when we should be coming together to get rid of this corrupt societal standard. If we want things to get better, we need to show everyone the truth. The beauty myth is anything but a myth. It\u2019s a real and pressing matter that will continue to devalue women for generations to come unless we come together and make our needs a reality. ",
