The front stage theory is a facade, or a performance, that people put on when surrounded by new people. The looking glass theory is how we think others feel about ourselves. Although the front stage and looking glass theory are comparable in that they both focus on how people view us in social interactions they differ in the ways that we alter our personalities in given situations. \nThe front stage theory is a social space, created by Goffman, that provides a framework for understanding the many layers of identity presentation and social interaction. When participating in the front stage theory, representation of the public persona is created when faced with social situations. In doing so, they carefully choose their actions and appearances to leave the right impressions based on the audience. For example, when meeting someone for the first time you\u2019re not as vulnerable due to the pressure of people watching your every move. The performance aspect of social interactions is emphasized heavily in Goffman's theory, which highlights how people intentionally control how they appear in different social contexts.\nThe Looking Glass theory compares to the front stage theory because of the idea that you are constantly putting on a performance to have a reaction from others. I have experienced these theories during Fall Recruitment for a sorority. As I was going around to different houses, I was constantly using my front stage self to be liked by different girls in each chapter. I projected my own image onto other people, in hopes that they might reflect it back to me. In addition, I experienced the looking glass theory when conversation flowed naturally because I felt as if the different girls, I talked to enjoy my presence. The dynamic interaction between an individual's internal self-concept and outside social cues is made clear by Cooley's theory. Cooley clarifies how people negotiate the challenging terrain of identity development among a network of social influences by highlighting the significance of social interactions and interpersonal perceptions. This viewpoint emphasizes the significant influence of social dynamics on a person's self-concept, underscoring the significance of empathy and understanding the formation of identity.\nIn contrast, these two theories go against each other because the front stage theory deals with how you individually alter your personality towards a certain group of people, whereas the looking glass self is focused on how you alter your personality based upon how others perceive you. For example, I enjoy eating capers on my pasta. When practicing the front stage theory, I would choose to eat something else when I am around new people. However, if I practiced the looking glass theory, I would choose to eat the capers on my pasta around new people, but I would be constantly second guessing myself and assuming the people I am with are judging me. \nAs a result, during interpersonal interactions, the constant conversation between one's internal self-perception and outside social feedback produces an awareness and understanding of identity. Essentially, Cooley's theory stresses the passive reception and acceptance of social feedback in creating individual self-concept, whereas Goffman's theory emphasizes the active performance of self in social circumstances. Moreover, people actively build their social image to negotiate a variety of social circumstances, whether it is through the planned performances in Goffman's framework or the imagined reflections in Cooley's theory. When combined, these divergent viewpoints provide complicated insights on the intricate relationship between social impact and human agency in social environments and the complicated and diverse nature of identity formation. In contrast, Cooley's theory highlights the passive reception and internalization of social input in shaping individual self-concept, but Goffman\u2019s theory highlights an individual change for approval of others. This view emphasizes the reciprocal nature of social interaction and the importance of social dynamics in forming identity formation.\n",

        "text": "\nComparing Sociologists\nIn The Neurology of Religion, Maryanski and Turner argue that emotions are the simplest and purest form of the human consciousness. They emphasize the importance of emotions for the expansion of the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding it through thought, experiences, and/or the senses for ancestral hominids. This was accomplished by many points of evolution in the brain; this is to say that the brain did not undergo a sudden dramatic change. Rather, more and more connections between different areas of the brain started developing. They say the use of emotion enhances memory, for example a hominid finds two trees one has sweet delicious fruit in it, the other shoots seeds out of the trunk when it is touched protecting the fruit. The hominid would associate the two trees with emotions. The hominid could obtain the yummy fruit from one tree and would associate this tree with happiness. The other tree that shoots seeds out would be associated with pain, and fear, thus initiating memory for the hominid to know which tree to climb. With the introduction of memory came the  introduction to rationality, helping us make decisions based on thoughts we incorporate with choices often based on the memory. Emotion leads to these behavioral accomplishments and is the most basic concept that makes them up. Whether Harari read Maryanski and Turner\u2019s work or not he shares this common idea and compliments their work with his own.\nIt is because Harari believes emotions to be fragile, pure, and basic that he believes they are able to be so easily manipulated and even broken or coded. Harari wants to warn the world of relying too heavily on technology as he is afraid of a future where an AI will dominate humans. To attain this an AI would need to have emotions, as we have discussed emotions lead to all sorts of more complex feelings and behaviors. It is also true that emotions lead to the feeling of superiority over lesser things. Humans consider themselves the superior species due to a greater grasp of emotions as it is embedded in the neurological working used to build a far more advanced society than any other animal. So who is to say if an AI were to grasp emotions that they would not get a sense of superiority to humans eventually. There are already cases where humans are inferior to AI\u2019s. Harari even gives the example of chess, \u201cA closer look at the world of chess might indicate where things are heading in the long run. It is true that for several years after Deep Blue defeated Kasparov, human-computer cooperation flourished in chess. Yet in recent years computers have become so good at playing chess that their human collaborators have lost their value and might soon become utterly irrelevant\u201d (Harari, 2019, 32). This is a great example because it provides a good perspective as to how fast computers are learning the game that Harari defines as \u201cone of the crowning glories of human intelligence\u201d (2019, 33). In other words chess was considered a superior way of testing human intelligence and now computers are exponentially gaining on them. As a matter of fact, a new AI produced by Google called AlphaZero was able to overtake the leading chess algorithm in only four hours. It is now unclear if any human will ever be able to reign supreme in chess again. \nHarari fears giving AI emotions regardless of the fact that emotions are needed in order for an AI to help humans because an AI needs to value human life. Emotions would be the logical next step in the evolution of machines. If we want a machine to be able to unlock more complex functions such as the human brain, emotion is a vital step for that goal assuming an AI will process emotion the same way as the human brain. To code emotion into an algorithm is essentially the same as manipulating human emotion, Harari demonstrates how easy that task is with an example of musical arts in modern popularity. \u201cOf course, personalized art might never catch on, because people will continue to prefer common hits that everybody likes. How can you dance or sing together to a song nobody besides you knows?  But algorithms could prove even more adept at producing global  hits than personalized rarities. By using massive biometric databases garnered  from millions of people, the algorithm could know which biochemical buttons to press in order to produce a global hit that would get everyone swinging like crazy on the dance floors. If art is really about inspiring (or manipulating) human emotions, few if any human musicians will be able to compete with such an algorithm, because they cannot match it in understanding the chief instrument they are playing on: the human biochemical system\u201d (Harari, 2019, 29). This excerpt shows how easy and common it is to manipulate emotions. Despite Harari, and The Neurology of Religion having completely different topics,  Harari was still able to complement the work with aspects of his own. On the other hand,  Harari found an aspect of Maryanski and Turner\u2019s work to be wrong in his opinion and disagreed with it.\nThe point of disagreement Harari has with Maryanski and Turner\u2019s work is their view of religion and the role it plays in society. To understand the role of religion we first have to look at how religion was formed through human evolution. As we have already discussed, through the development of emotions humans started to become neurologically superior to other species which led to a greater social divide between humans and other species. For example,  humans have to perform work to maintain their social connections; this is due to the sheer emotional depth in interactions. Simply put, everything has meaning to humans in our interactions whether that meaning has a negative or positive connotation. Other mammals have bio programmers, automatic connections that can be thought of as their animalistic instincts. An elephant doesn\u2019t have to learn to stick with the herd, it is sort of a natural law that mammals have to stay socially active. Whereas humans, while some find comfort in social situations, are a less socially dependent species.  It is seen as normal for an adult human to have a house of their own and not seek a family. It is their personal choice. Furthermore,  humans have become more intellectual because our emotional depth has developed. We are able to feel the weight of a decision and how it might affect not just ourselves but others as well. As we became more emotional we began to paint materialistic things with different emotional significance. This gave a greater importance to different objects, family heirlooms, ancestral artifacts, etcetera. As time passed on these objects that were held dear, protected, and made into tall-tales they became religious. They took an objective truth and through time these objects and the stories with them became fact.  Maryanski and Turner say that religion became an absolute truth for humanity and if we look back in history a lot of major policy decisions were made from religious persuasion. Maryanski and Turner praise the formation of emotions for being the keystone in human development that sparked the making of a far more complex society. They believe emotions will and should be the driving force behind important decision making. Furthermore, if religious decision persuasion is a byproduct of emotional thinking then Maryanski and Turner would be supporters. This is where the disagreement between Harari and the other authors comes. Perhaps it was acceptable in the past however for the 21st century Harari feels that religion should ultimately play a different role in policy making.\n The different roll should be not one at all. Harari covers this in one of his chapters in his book where he explains why he believes religion should have little to no role in policy making. Harari\u2019s reasoning for this varies from religious ideals being outdated for modern society to religious influence having their religious motives above their intentions. Touching on outdated ideals Harai provides the example, \u201cWhen Ayatollah Khamenei needs to make a crucial decision about the iranian economy, he will not be able to find the necessary answer in the Quran, because seventh century Arabs knew very little about the problems and opportunities of modern industrial economies and global financial markets. So he, or his aides must turn to Karl Marx, Milton Freedman, Frederick Hayek, and the modern science of economics to get answers\u201d (Harari, 2019, 133-134). This perspective is that a lot of religious ideals were founded to solve olden problems and often times do not fit today's issues hence we cannot rely on religion to solve political issues as today we are facing issues unheard of  in the past. Harari suggests that religious scriptures can be used to justify modern solutions; however, when faced with a modern policy issue it would be very difficult to find a direct answer in scriptures. He suggests it is significantly easier to seek an answer outside of scripture and to then go back, find common ideas and twist the scripture to justify your answer claiming that you seeked the answer through religious means. Harari says \u201ctwisting the scripture degrades it, \u201cfrom a source of true knowledge to a source of mere authority\u201d (Harari, 2019, 134). Religious influence is a powerful thing, followers will whole-heartedly support the actions of their religious movement just because the leader of the movement is of their religion. This is to say that in America if two candidates were running for office and despite the opponent being more qualified Christians would still likely vote for the less qualified candidate simply because he is of their religion and his actions will reflect that of Christian ideals. Harari touches on this himself when he talks about the Pope leading a holy mission against global warming, because he is the highest Catholic leader. Catholics will support this movement while evangelicals will oppose it simply because he is Catholic. Harari states, \u201cThis is already beginning to happen. Opposition to environmental regulations is incorporated into the fire-and-brimstone sermons of some American evangelical pastors, while Pope Francis is leading the charge against global warming in the name of Christ\u2026 So perhaps by 2070, the environmental question will make all the difference in the world whether you are evangelical or Catholic. It goes without saying that evangelicals will object to any cap on carbon-emissions, while Catholics will believe that Jesus preached that we must protect the environment\u201d (2019, 136). Harai even says that this will reflect in other areas such as the cars each side of the conflict will drive whether gasoline powered or electric cars. The influence of religion can be a dangerous thing, if  an idea turns into a religious dogma  there is  instantly a significant following because leaders will preach that the religious icon believed in it as well. Not only is this disrespectful to authentic scripture that is being mis-purposed but it is also creating a possible dangerous power struggle. Harari ultimately feels that it would be best if religious intentions and ideas were left out of major policy making.\nThrough Harari, Maryanski and Turner\u2019s work we were able to see the way sociologists relate to each other\u2019s work. It is clear that both sides were discussing completely different things. With Maryanski and Turner talking about the evolution and development of the modern human and Harari talking about where the 21st century will take us and how to prepare for it. Despite this sociologists always relate to one another whether by disagreeing or agreeing. This actually builds a stronger argument as it shows they are capable of comprehending other\u2019s work and using that to further push thier own point.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarari, Y. N.

        "text": "SOC 105-002\nNovember 29, 2021\nA small overlook on Sociology\u2019s many concepts\nAs we have all read what Harari had to say within his book \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d as well as the numerous readings within the many modules throughout our time in this Sociology class. There have been numerous points made that I am sure I was not the only one who were intrigued to learn about but with that comes some gray area. While we have read the brilliant concepts from authors including Durkheim, Mead, Goffman, Foucault, Harari and the list just goes on and on, it would be inadequate to say that there is no overlap in some of these concepts. Now rather that overlap be inconsistent or consistent with one another would be hard to tell with just a single glance at this material.\nThe first reading that I would like to bring to your attention is one of the first readings if not the very first one we were given, The Neurology of Religion which was written by Maryanski and Turner. This reading goes into quite some detail about the adaptions that had to happen for humans to reach the spot where they are today. Great Apes back in the early ages adapted in ways that seem far beyond understandable to me. These Great Apes were able to have rationality which only came about according to Maryanski and Turner because they had the ability to have emotions. When one is able to have emotions or has emotions in general it can allow for things such as stronger relationship bonds to form which would be needed for these Great Apes to eventually became the humans they adapted to. Emotions also enable one to think symbolically which when you look at the bigger picture this is what ultimately allowed societies, religions, and families etc. to be able to exist today. This then becomes quite consistent with the theory of collective consciousness (Durkheim) as a whole. \nWith the Great Apes now not only being able to symbolically think as well as form these stronger bonds it will only continue to increase the size of one\u2019s emotional capacity which made it possible for spoken languages as well as cultures to come about. As a part of all of this comes religion, and according to Durkheim society would not have to about if it wasn\u2019t for religious forces. The belief that there is something beyond the life we lie here on Earth. This can be quite scary to think about especially since there is no evidence that there is anything after death for all we know it could be total darkness or we could all come back as bunnies\u2026just something to think about! \nBack on the topic, religion gives something to the collective to believe in so the inevitable fate that awaits us all isn\u2019t as scary. Harari on the other hand believes that while religion can help bring people together as well as give people what seems to be a sense of identity it also makes those who have different beliefs not be able to see eye to eye, which in all honesty is the truth in my opinion. Religion (chapter 8) according to Harari might not cure the many diseases that infect this world or build the bombs that we use/used in many wars, but religion does decide who you are and how you see others around you. It decides if you see someone like you generally see yourself or if you see them as the \u201cother.\u201d Religion has taken how many perceive people within the world to a whole new level. He expresses this by saying that there are \u201cbeautiful\u201d religious traditions as well as there being \u201cugly\u201d religious traditions. He then goes into detail talking about how these religious traditions divide people and that though we are all the same there are these \u201csmall differences\u201d that determine how one will be treated. An example he gives of this would be how LGBT people are faced with what is ultimately a life-or-death situation depending on where they live. In Iran I don\u2019t know if it is considered illegal to be gay and/or lesbian within the country but it is not rare for someone to be killed or most of the time they would be maltreated due to that fact that they liked the same sex as them. \nWhile both of these concepts of religion talk about how it shapes us in many ways, one can see the obvious difference between the two. Durkheim focuses on how religion shaped us into who we are and how it brought us together and allowed us to think symbolically and become the humans we are today. Harari focused his concept on how religion is what is ultimately tearing us apart. How religion today has it\u2019s negative as well as positive impacts but the negative in my opinion outweighs what these positives are especially since nobody truly knows which religion is the most accurate and there is a good chance that we may never know seeing how it is tearing many of us apart and causing wars. These are kind of similar in the sense that they both build off of each other that while we needed religion to build us together it is also the thing that could break us apart.\nNow the next reading I would like to bring light to is \u201cMicro-foundations\u201d by Fligstein and Macadam\u2019s. Within this reading they both talked about how many humans thrive to have a purpose within their lives. This is similar to Durkheim\u2019s theory that religion is really made so that we can avoid this \u201cexistential fear\u201d because though it may not have anything to do with religion having a sense of purpose for your life can make the inevitable death, we all know a little too well a bit easier to bear. One goes through the same process of being confused and they may feel as though their life is ultimately meaningless whereas coming together as a collective and having these jobs can help them avoid that situation as a whole. Even if you take away the outlook on without jobs there would be no purpose or that life would not be as valued as it should be, our daily interactions with other humans continuously make us feel loved. Spending time with those around you regardless of if they are strangers give everyone a sense that they are not alone especially if it is during a bad situation.\nHarari on the other hand in the chapter called \u201cWork\u201d discusses the topic that there is a decent chance that the workforce we have in our head in a few years may not be anything like we would think. These AI machines are beating humans at their own jobs which obviously would make sense being that they have algorithms and can learn things a lot faster than any human can. These algorithms could grant these private companies as well as the owners with more money and things that will enrich them even more. So, if the rich continue to only get richer than the poor will ultimately since their economic value will decrease as well as their political power. Also, since these machines will be getting to know you almost more than you know yourself it can allow for these companies to not only manipulate you but also make decisions for you. If this becomes the case, we will end up relying on them more than ever and it will become harder to stray away from these things. \nThough not having a job would not be the best thing in the world it would be beneficial when you are looking at the bigger picture. Having these AI\u2019s take over some of these jobs could lead to improvements as well as better results in total. An example of this could be where Harari discussed the AIs would take over some of the doctors\u2019 jobs which could help with new treatments and things of that nature to be known throughout the whole world within minutes since all the AI\u2019s will be programmed the same. \nAccording to Harari when changing to robots doing majority of the work there will be dangers with algorithms. When you put these robots on the same system though it can help in a numerous number of ways there is also the chance that there will be mistakes but when all these machines are on the same system every one of them will make the mistake which can ultimately lead to some catastrophic results. Say the future did hold what Harari used as his topic for the chapter called \u201cWork,\u201d and we take it back to the example of the doctors and hospital staff being replaced with these programmed robots. Personally, I would find it quite terrifying to be about to undergo surgery and all I see is a robot there to comfort me knowing that there is even the slightest possibility that I may not make it out alive of that operating room. Regardless of the jobs being lost nothing can compare to the soothing aura of a nice man or lady being there and reassuring you that everything will be alright. I would be exactly like Fligstein and MacAdam\u2019s said\u2026 I would feel meaningless that one I already don\u2019t have a job so my life purpose that I worked hard for my whole life is thrown out the window but I also would feel terrified that I may get to experience the inevitable fate everyone is waiting for because the robot messed up an algorithm and now I am dead. With all of this being out in the open and knowing that Fligstein and MacAdam\u2019s has a theory on how we as humans ultimately need a purpose in life it does leave one wondering what the future has in store for all of us. \n",

        "text": "\t850611619\t\t\t\nPersonal Monetization\nThe pervasive commercialization of personal relationships has proliferated in today's consumer-driven society. In the present-day era, people engage with others to acquire various benefits such as social recognition, financial gain, or emotional backing from them. To scrutinize this trend and examine its impact on our communal lifestyle through Erving Goffman's concept of \"impression management,\" is a major objective for this document. This essay proposes that impression management tactics have become increasingly popular approaches utilized by individuals seeking advantages amidst the commodification of interpersonal connections within contemporary consumer-led societies.\nSocial interactions that are turned into commodities, where people act in a way to acquire social advantage or profit has been on the rise lately. Such behavior allows individuals to display themselves as appealing and is referred to as impression management - displaying oneself selectively so they can get desired reactions from others. Erving Goffman developed this concept when he theorized about social interaction, emphasizing its symbolic context with participants fully aware of their actions' significance and how others might perceive them.\nThere exist numerous instances that provide evidence for the notion of impression management. One such instance is the \"Instagram influencer\" trend, where individuals upload sanitized and glorified versions of themselves to their audience's delight. Instagram influencers meticulously select hashtags, filters, as well as lighting in order to portray an expert image of themself. By generating content that captivates both visually and intellectually, they are capable of drawing attention from a vast social media audience.\nTo delve deeper into the effects of commercialized personal connections on our society, it is noteworthy to analyze technology's function. The upsurge in social media and other technological developments have enabled us to maintain perpetual communication with others which wasn't always possible before; however, this comes with both favorable and unfavorable outcomes for our social existence. The favorability within this interconnectivity comes from the practically instantaneous communication it provides, yet this has created a culture of desensitization and overstimulation within the youth of the technological age. \nLooking at it from a different perspective, enhancements in technological innovations have enabled flawless interaction with people located all over the world despite their geographical whereabouts. This has presented novel avenues for social engagement and enabled us to cultivate meaningful bonds despite differences in culture or background. However, conversely speaking, the perpetual obligation to portray an ideal image on online platforms can be overwhelmingly taxing leading to a potential disposition towards unease and inner hesitation.\nMoreover, the strides made in technology have paved fresh pathways for people to generate revenue from their interpersonal relationships. To exemplify, those who hold sway on social media platforms can take advantage of opportunities and accumulate a substantial sum by endorsing various commodities and amenities among their supporters. This has generated an innovative kind of career that capitalizes upon people's private connections enabling them to procure livelihoods through it.\nNevertheless, this conveys an inquiry regarding the veracity of these individual associations. Could a bona fide affiliation with someone exist if they are remunerated to endorse their merchandise? This is a multifaceted matter that necessitates further investigation; nonetheless, it emphasizes the plausible detriments when personal alliances become commoditized.\nIn its entirety, the commercialization of human affiliations is an intricate occurrence that manifests both favorable and undesirable consequences for our communal existence. Through investigating the significance of presenting oneself in a positive light and technology as influential factors, we can commence comprehending this tendency's influence while devising tactics to establish genuine and substantial bonds with one another.\nAn additional example is the method wherein individuals who are in committed bonds frequently utilize methods of deceit to display themselves as \"the ideal duo\" on their various social media profiles. This strategic portrayal, meant to elicit acknowledgement from others who similarly compare relationships through these displays, allows such pairs of people to exploit personal connections. This is similar to other aspects of our existence which can be commercialized under pressure for superior perfection and validation.\nIn today's age of commodified personal interactions, individuals are compelled to exhibit themselves favorably in order to impress others. The presentation of oneself extends beyond the realm of social media and is evident across other social contexts as well. A prime example being job interviews where first impressions occupy a paramount position in securing employment opportunities for candidates. Impression management has therefore become indispensable amidst the proliferation of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn alongside an acute emphasis on presentability while stepping out into public spaces - making it a critical aspect synonymous with contemporary societal living patterns.\nIn the field of mental health research, there is a particular domain that examines how commodified social interactions affect individuals. Research indicates that feelings of anxiety and depression may escalate due to constant pressure to project an optimistic front on social media while simultaneously comparing oneself with other people's seemingly perfect lives. Consequently, personal connections can become commercialized in ways where competition for acceptance becomes necessary and online presence has to be monitored incessantly - leading towards heightened stress levels and loss of positive emotional experiences.\nOne of the consequences that arise from commodified personal connections is the likelihood for social disparity. Those who possess a talent for presenting themselves positively and accumulating more approval may be granted better access to resources and prospects. Take, for instance, well-known figures on various online platforms with an extensive fanbase; they can readily convert their popularity into sponsorships or endorsements - unlike those without much following whatsoever, as such individuals may miss out on these opportunities in its entirety. Consequently, creating a gap where people who adeptly commercialize their personal ties stand to profit while others are left at a disadvantage.\nThe commercialization of interpersonal connections could potentially have an adverse effect on our perception of sincerity and bona fide human interactions. In scenarios where social exchanges are motivated by self-interest, there may be reduced opportunities for genuine dialogue or emotional intimacy. People might feel compelled to portray themselves in a particular manner to earn acceptance or evade criticism, thereby resulting in less sincere communication and superficial bonds between individuals.\nConsidering the potential ramifications that may ensue, it is imperative to contemplate on our approach towards social interactions and what motivates us to pursue them. While the inclination to capitalize on personal relationships could stem from present-day consumerism, taking a proactive stance against this tendency becomes our responsibility as individuals. Our priority should always be cultivating sincere human connections without any ulterior motives in mind rather than prioritizing private benefits over them. By accentuating building genuine bonds and esteeming connection beyond societal standing, we yield an opportunity for more gratifying social lifestyles that are imbued with significance.\nAs we come to an end of this paper, it is important that we reflect on the commercialization of personal connections in modern-day consumer-oriented societies by making use of Erving Goffman's theory on social conduct. The exchange or selling of such links has resulted in individuals purposely presenting themselves favorably before others. This analysis demonstrates how impression management has become a critical tool for achieving benefits such as positive feedback from society, emotional support and material wealth within current day societal set-ups. Nonetheless, further research must be carried out to fully understand the impact associated with commodified interpersonal interactions.\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\nOct. 14th, 2021\nThe Looking Glass Self\nWhat does it mean to see yourself through someone else\u2019s perspective? A question that many people ponder upon. Along with everyone else I was in search for an answer. Why was it that my view of myself changes when I am around certain people? It has been believed that this could be because your self-esteem has gotten lower, or you just have the wrong friends, which could potentially all feed into the answer.\nThe looking glass self, a concept created by Charles Horton Cooley, is what effects how one may feel about themselves. Just like how one may see their peers around them it is most likely completely different from how they believe they are. Perspective and perception play a huge role within the way anyone views themselves. Cooley states within the looking glass self that it is ultimately the way we see ourselves socially, it is our social self.\nThroughout my eighteen years of living, I have encountered numerous amounts of people from a variety of different backgrounds. When meeting these people, it came to my attention that there were always certain people I would much rather be around, and they all have something in common. Anyone who has ever approached me with good energy or just seemed like they were happy to be in the same place I was made me feel as if I belonged. They showed no negativity towards me so I knew that they couldn\u2019t have seen me in a negative manner.\nTo get a little more in depth there was a time back in the summer of 2017 where I went to Europe. I got to see four beautiful places, London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam though I had an amazing experience overseas and I would love nothing more to go again there were some things that made me see myself differently while being there. Obviously, going to a completely different continent would mean that I was also going to experience different cultures as well as different people. One of the days I was there I was in the airport at London and a woman continuously kept watching me and just looking at me as if she were confused. She then decided to come up to me and ask me if I was Norwegian, I told her that I was not, but she was more than convinced that I was someone from Norway. I have never been asked something like that before probably because some people believe it is rude to ask, \u201cwhat are you?\u201d but it opened a door for me and started to make me question whether people see me and assume that I am from a certain ethnic group and/or race. It then opened my imagination up to the idea that some people might assume I belong to a said race or ethnic group and judge me poorly from it. It messed with my mind for a while and still sometimes does. This woman also then continuously wanted to hear me speak because I sounded like I \u201cwas from Texas\u201d and she had never seen a girl who looked the way I did speak the way that I do. This then led me to think I sound absolutely ridiculous and that everyone probably agreed with her because my voice really doesn\u2019t match my looks.\nI have also had many friends within my life to which I have made some crazy memories with but there are barely a handful that make me feel good about myself. The way that they all look at me and care for me like no one else has and always come to me with open arms and big smile on their face shows me that they have no intentions other than pure ones. They make me feel like my authentic self when I am around them and from the way they continuously act they show me that I am worth so much and that I am valued. They came along after I hit a hard place in my life. A guy that I saw the world of and who I at first thought saw the same of me really changed how I saw myself. He treated me as if I had no purpose in my life and as if I did something so horrible to hurt him. After being around someone who treats you in a negative manner for so long it takes a toll on how you see yourself. I started to believe that no matter what I did nothing I would ever do would be right. He made me believe by the way he treated me that I did not deserve to be loved and that my worth amounted to absolutely nothing. This then led to me feeling like everyone perceived me the way I perceived myself at that time which made me feel even worse about myself. I assumed everyone had lost hope for me just as I had lost hope for myself because a man who had no idea what he was doing with his life treated me so badly that I figured it must\u2019ve been the way that I was that caused this. It wasn\u2019t until I met my friends that I mentioned before that changed how I perceive myself and how I assume others perceive me. \nCharles Horton Cooley believes that there are these \u201cthree principal elements\u201d that tend to create what he calls \u201cthe looking glass self\u201d they are the imagination of how we believe another person sees us, the imagination of the judgement that we think comes along with their perception of us, and then the feeling we then get from those things which can range from prideful and happy to worthless and depressed. The concept itself is about how we view our self-image which can be greatly influenced by the interactions we make with people around us and by what society deems as acceptable. \nAn example of this concept could look a little something like this. I am going to meet up with some people within a club I have recently joined. I personally think I am a very friendly person and are quite easy to talk to so I can hold a conversation though I am nervous about going to meet these new people I trust that my social skills can potentially help me avoid any type of awkwardness and spark a connection with some of these people. I get there and I am trying to make casual conversation, so everyone isn\u2019t sitting there looking bored or in all just ready to leave. In response to trying to break the ice the only responses I seem to get are either very short sentences, or no response at all. Everyone avoids really keeping eye contact which I find is a key piece to making conversation and showing interest. I then begin to feel anxious because I believed in my social skills but now it is seemingly like they are currently failing me. Whereas if these new people I would\u2019ve met would have held eye contact as well as try to carry on the conversation my views on my social abilities would not have changed. Depending on if a positive response would have been given, I would still have faith in my abilities and the self-image I have for myself would have remained the same. Since all I received was a majority of negative responses rather than be words or just body language it then led me to see myself differently and feel as if they wanted nothing to do with me when we met, and it seemed as if they did not even want to have a conversation with me in the first place.\nWith the knowledge you now have about the looking glass self we can now relate them back to the experiences I spoke on before. When in the London airport I went in assuming by the looks of me as well as how I acted that one would be able to view myself for what I was. I am a biracial female who is half African American as well as Caucasian. When I was approached by this woman of a race and/or ethnic group I wasn\u2019t sure of and was asked whether I was Norwegian it nonetheless confused me. In her eyes I was of Norwegian descent, but I was nowhere near being that. It then made me believe that other people probably saw me for something I wasn\u2019t as well. Then when she commented on my accent and how my voice did not match what she would\u2019ve assumed I would have sounded like it really made my self-image change I become very self-conscious of how other people saw me because of the way my voice sounded. I thought to myself \u201cdo I sound like a country hillbilly to everyone?\u201d which I have found out is true but that is irrelevant at this moment. In all hearing that my voice sounded like it belonged to someone quite different from me really affected me because from that moment forward, I felt like everyone thought I sounded crazy.\nLooking back on the time that I was getting treated terribly and feeling like I didn\u2019t deserve anything good to happen in my life I see now that I felt this way because that man was my \u201cbiggest mirror\u201d he was who I cared about the most and would do anything under the sun for. I say he was my biggest mirror because he was what determined how I felt about myself and then it eventually went to how I thought everyone saw me. Getting treated rudely by one of the only people who truly understood you will make you question quite a few things. My \u201cbiggest mirror\u201d within this looking glass concept was giving me the idea and really persuading me all together that I was the problem then I did become the problem because I allowed him to make me see things the way he wanted me to. \nWhat does it mean to see yourself through someone else\u2019s perspective? The looking glass self is how one does so. You get around these people rather you just met them or if they have been in your life for a while but the way the interactions go, they place ideas in your head of how that person or those people perceive you. If you are continuously getting treated horrible by someone or the way, they give off body language is negative then that will lead to you having a negative look on yourself as well as feeling down as well. Now if you are continuously praised by these people and you are shown nothing less than their love for you this will make the idea you have of yourself take a positive turn. Surrounding yourself with people who are positive when interacting with you will enable you on your journey to have a better self-image. One is not defined by how others act towards you but it can often seem like it due to Cooley\u2019s concept the looking glass self.\n\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105-006\nMay 2, 2022\nThriving and Surviving\n\tHave you ever seen a woman working as an electrician?  How about a mechanical engineer?  The answer is probably yes being that it is the 21st century, however, that does not mean that women do not face the same discrimination that they faced decades ago just because of their gender.  Sometimes these women become subject to a concept called defensive othering, which is when they know that they are a part of a subordinate group, however, they believe that they are not a part those judgments and discriminations.  Although this now allows the one subordinate group to subjugate another, sometimes it is necessary to do so in a male dominated field just for a woman to thrive.  I have faced a similar situation being a woman who is a deckhand.  I understand from both sides what it is like to be discriminated against and what it is like to be a part of defensive othering.  In a field that is predominately male, sometimes it is crucial to do so.\n\tWomen have come a long way when it comes to the careers they are able to pursue.  A job that we have begun to conquer is engineering.  Now more than ever there are woman engineers excelling in their field, but they still have a long way to go regarding the bias that they face.  Obviously, it was not so easy for them to get to where they are today.  Along with the massive amounts of education that they have to go through, they also had an extra step to take, which was persevering over the tremendous hurdles of everyone telling them that they will never make it as an engineer.  In the past, women always had to live up to the standard of being the beautiful housewife, who would cook, clean, and live for her husband.  It was not classified as normal to even have a job, let alone a job that was deemed as \u201cmanly\u201d.  This made it so much harder for them to accomplish their goals.  Of course, these stereotypes and judgments can be ignored, but for how long until it becomes unbearable?  For my first year and a half of college, I was a coastal engineering major.  It was me and two other girls as the only females in my engineering classes.  Most of the time, we got the feeling that the guys thought that they were better than us, just because we are girls.  Eventually we learned that we had to join the mentality that they had just so we did not feel subordinate to them.  Although it was contradicting in that it was going against feminism, it is what we had to do to thrive in our male dominated classes.  Not only did we stop feeling inferior to the men in the class, but we also saw improvements in our grades.  It is necessary to adapt to the environment that you are in so that you can succeed.\n\tThe same concept occurred at my job.  At home, I am a deckhand on a ferry boat, and I started when I was 16.  Not only was I discriminated against by some of the passengers, but also by my male colleagues.  Through the years, I have heard things like, \u201cGive that to him, it\u2019s too heavy for you to lift\u201d or \u201cWhy is there a little girl running the boat? Where is the captain, I do not feel safe\u201d.  These are comments that both my female colleagues and I hear constantly from passengers, and we know by now that it is something that is going to be difficult to get around.  On the other hand, we quickly figured out a way to fit in with our male coworkers, while still being able to adhere to being feminine.  Although it may not be something that we are proud of, defensive othering is what has helped us develop our confidence and flourish at our jobs.  Another part of the company is the job of the ticket girls.  The ticket girls tend to be more girly and feminine than the girls who are deckhands.  They also have fewer and less vigorous tasks as ticket girls.  A way in which us female deckhands use defensive othering is by comparing ourselves to the ticket girls.  By creating a sense that we accomplish more, and have more demanding tasks, we have found that the men at our job will not see us as equal to the ticket girls but hold us at a higher standing because we are acting in a similar way to the men.  Again, it is not something to brag about, however, if it is not done then, it is tough for us to gain any confidence in what we are doing, which then makes it extremely difficult for any of us to move up in rank.\n\tThe concept of defensive othering is not only seen in careers, but in many other places as well.  For example, in some sports that are deemed as \u201cmen\u2019s sports\u201d, the women that participate create a shield that protects them from being discriminated against.  The shield that they create is their attitude, which they modify to act like their oppressor.  These women believe that if they act like the \u201cdominant class\u201d which would be men, that they will not be subject to the bias that all women face.  For them to prove themselves to the dominated power, they need to reinforce that the stigmatizing labels, such as girls not being as strong or physically coordinated as men, are true of other women, but not for them.  Although the concept refutes many of the things that feminists have worked for, it is a coping mechanism that has helped groups that are subject to the stigmas.  It gives the group a sense of confidence that they would otherwise not have if it were not for this coping mechanism.  As controversial as this concept may appear, there are many situations in which it has helped people of subjugated groups thrive in an environment that in the past, would not even allow them in.\n\tClearly, I can speak from experience when I say that I have become a member of defensive othering.  Being a deckhand, an engineering major, and a woman, I must find some way to succeed in places where men see themselves as superior.  It is a conflicting topic for me knowing that on some level, it is wrong because it reverses what feminists have worked their entire lives for, but on the other hand, it allows me to find my place in positions that I can feel superior and accomplished.  Being a part of a group that participates in defensive othering lets me to put myself in the shoes of other people that are in situations that are like mine.  It is now evident that minorities partake in this behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\tSometimes, there are situations where it is necessary to become a part of defensive othering.  It becomes a mechanism to thrive and survive in places that have a clear dominant group.  Many people have already discovered that this is the case because they feel inferior to the so-called dominant group, based on stigmas that developed from the past.  Although it is morally wrong in some cases, people need to find ways in which they can succeed in the areas in which they feel they are the minority.\n\t",

This phenomenon is commonly due to a lack of money in these areas.  As countries develop, one might assume that those living in poorer parts of the country would receive more money and better services. However, that rarely happens. So, what happens to the mothers who have no or limited maternal healthcare? How does that affect the child\u2019s health and its chance of survival? How is the mother\u2019s physical and mental health affected? Socioeconomic differences cause women to receive varying levels of healthcare, and studies have shown that women in rural, impoverished, or uneducated areas are more likely to receive inferior care. In this paper, I will discuss the effects socioeconomic differences have on the mother\u2019s physical and mental health, infant mortality rate, and infant injury and explain why all mothers should receive equal healthcare. \n\tSocioeconomic differences in maternal health care align with the unit in class regarding race and oppression, specifically Collins\u2019s The Matrix of Domination. In this work, she presents the idea that all women are discriminated against in comparison to men solely because of their gender. From this, one can imply that women do not receive quality maternal healthcare as it is not a service that men require. The healthcare quality one receives is based on institutional biases such as race, class, and gender. According to Collins, black women are the most disadvantaged in society as they are discriminated against due to their race, gender, and sex, which all intersect to form a matrix of discrimination. Collins also states that the world\u2019s Eurocentric view causes society to see people as two races- black or white- meaning that any woman who is not white is considered black. This issue is significant as women of color tend to also be in lower social classes, challenging them with more socioeconomic struggle. These struggles include education, access to resources, family size, and workplace occupations, which all impact their health. \n\tSome countries, such as New Zealand, have maternity care that is government-funded and free for all women (Dawson et al., 2021). The system is composed mostly of midwives. However, women do have the option to pay to see specialists, such as an obstetrician. Despite all women having free access to maternal healthcare, there are still inequalities. Approximately 3,800 women in New Zealand voluntarily completed a survey regarding their health care experience with additional data detailing their residential locations. The results showed that transport, housing, poverty, racism, and lower education levels were all barriers to equitable health and the outcome of the mother and the baby. The most vulnerable groups of women tended to be the most unsatisfied as younger, highly deprived, and remote rural women were most affected by inequality. They had fewer accessible services as healthcare centers were distributed based on population. Additionally, they had difficulties getting transportation to better facilities in urban areas. Women identifying as Pacific or M\u0101ori had more struggles as they said that cost was a factor in obtaining maternity care other than the standard midwife appointments, such as antenatal care (Dawson et al., 2021). \n\tNew Zealand has a better maternity healthcare model than most developed countries. For example, in the US, maternal healthcare is not provided to all women and is far from free. However, there are still issues with New Zealand\u2019s healthcare system. The lack of quality services given to women in areas with less economic resources is an issue as a zip code should not determine healthcare. Health is a human right and should not be taken from someone due to circumstances out of their control, such as the availability of health centers near them. This is especially true as public transportation is often not provided to women in rural areas. Additionally, one's money should not dictate their health, but even in New Zealand, money became a factor. Women in more urban areas with more clinics available, also tended to have more money (Dawson et al., 2020). This meant that if they had pregnancy complications, they had access to and were able to pay to see a specialist (Dawson et al., 2021). That implies that women with more money have more of a right to be healthy, receive more care,  and have healthy babies.\n\tSocioeconomic differences in New Zealand caused mothers to be unsatisfied with their physical healthcare, and an Italian study showed socioeconomic differences also cause decreased mental healthcare (Cena et al., 2020). Perinatal depression (PND) is one of the most commonly seen pregnancy complications and is known to produce severe effects on both the mother\u2019s mental health and the development of the fetus. This study examined factors of age, nationality, previous abortions, previous pregnancies, how many of the woman\u2019s children were alive, if the woman planned the pregnancy, and if the woman had resources for reproductive technology. 1,471 women from eleven healthcare centers in Italy filled out a 10-question survey in addition to an unstructured clinical interview to study these factors. The study determined that PND was present in all socioeconomic groups. However, the women from whom it was their first pregnancy that also had at least temporary employment had a lower risk of PND. Conversely, the risk of PND was highest in women with a lower education status and work or economic stressors. Similarly, postpartum depression (PPD) was found only in women who had several or severe economic problems (Cena et al., 2020). \n\tThe results of this study showed that women who had economic problems were most likely to have depression associated with their pregnancy (Cena et al., 2020). Not only did this put them at greater risk for PND, but socioeconomic disadvantages directly correlated to antenatal depression (AND) and PPD. Women who had not had already had children were more likely to have better mental health since they did not have the economic stressor of multiple children. Not only is this a problem for the mothers, but it is also a problem for their children, who can face decreased fetal development as a result (Cena et al., 2020). Once again, health should not be determined by where a person lives. Mental health disorders can affect people for years, and it is not right that people should have to suffer with them due to not having adequate care. \n\tThe effects of a mother's mental health on fetal development should not be overlooked, as, in 2019, 7.6 million children died before they reached the age of 5, 47% of which was due to neonatal mortality (Chauhan et al., 2021). Over half of those deaths were in developing countries. This was a direct result of the mothers not receiving proper maternal healthcare services, specifically antenatal care. Currently, the leading cause of neonatal mortality is antenatal, natal, or postnatal care, which practices such as vaccination and institutional deliveries could decrease. When researchers surveyed 6,01,509 households in India, results showed utilization of maternal healthcare varied greatly among socioeconomic regions based on antenatal care, safe delivery, and postnatal care. Women experiencing their first pregnancy in urban areas with access to mass media sources who did not work were the most likely to receive proper health care. These women were less likely to lose their children as a result of early neonatal mortality. Women that received early neonatal, postneonatal, and antenatal care were the most likely to have surviving children. This chance was not affected by demographic differences. However, socioeconomic differences were a significant factor in the children\u2019s health. Uneducated women living in rural areas and with no exposure to the mass media experienced higher rates of early neonatal mortality. However, they still fared better than mothers in scheduled castes or scheduled tribes with very little access to healthcare  (Chauhan et al., 2021).\n\tThis study showed that the use of maternal healthcare services severely affects the chances of early neonatal, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality  (Chauhan et al., 2021). The use of these services is in turn affected by socioeconomic features such as location and economic status. Women with a lower socioeconomic status received less and lower quality healthcare. This directly correlated to a higher chance of infant mortality. That correlation supports the idea that proper healthcare needs to be normalized everywhere. In the 20th century, women should not be losing children due to a lack of resources, especially due to predetermined circumstances. For instance, the women in scheduled castes and tribes are born into them  (Chauhan et al., 2021). They frequently have no chance to leave, and even if they did, would not leave, as that is all they have known. However, that leads those women to have a much higher chance of losing their children. In a world where countries have the money to stockpile nuclear weapons continuously, there should be enough resources to prevent mothers from losing their families. \n\tSocioeconomic groups greatly contribute to both infant mortality and injury.  In a study done in the UK, researchers studied brachial plexus (BP) injury in infants (Merrison et al., 2020). BP injury involves damage to the supraclavicular brachial plexus resulting in long-term self-image, mobility, and function issues. The study was conducted in the peripheral nerve unit of a hospital serving Northern Ireland, Wales, and South England. Researchers surveyed the participants through a questionnaire.  In the study, ethnicity data followed the categories used in the UK census. There was an increased risk of BP in patients who did not identify as white. Patients who classified themselves as Asians were 2.7 times more likely than whites to have a BP injury, and those considering themselves black were 6 times more likely than whites to suffer this injury. However, those weren\u2019t the only groups affected by this injury. Except for Indians, all ethnic minority groups were at a higher risk than whites. Additionally, those from deprived areas were also at greater risk. While there were limits to the study, such as the self-reported questionnaire, language barriers, and a lack of a control population, the risk for BP correlated with several factors. These factors ultimately included biological factors, access to care, health education, inequity within healthcare, and language barriers (Merrison et al., 2020).\n\tThis study showed that the healthcare system is very exclusive regarding race (Merrison et al., 2020). Women who were white and from an area with more resources were less likely to have a child with a BP injury. Additionally, BP injuries correlated with language barriers (Merrison et al., 2020). While it is difficult for a hospital to incorporate all languages, they should accommodate the major languages of their country, which this study showed is not the case. A woman\u2019s ethnicity and native language should not stop her or her child from receiving adequate healthcare. This problem is significant in society today, since 13 years after researchers conducted the study, no one has made any changes to rectify the situation. \n\tThese four studies support Collins\u2019s theory of Eurocentric thinking. The healthcare institutions provided white women with the healthiest babies, while women of color suffered. Since race, class, and gender all operate on the institutional level, women of color also face discrimination due to their class which is often associated with their race. Socioeconomic differences such as location, education level, and the previous number of abortions are all things that are frequently out of women\u2019s control but still greatly affect their lives. The brachial-plexus injury study expressed surprise that in 13 years, women and their infants had not received better care. Collins would not be surprised by this as she theorized that social change would require a \u201cchanged consciousness of individuals and social transformations of political and economic institutions.\u201d Women, especially those of lower class and color, have been oppressed since the beginning of society and will continue to be as underprivileged groups are in the same situations, allowing each group to gain a varied amount of privilege or punishment. So, even though all women are discriminated against, white women are unlikely to do anything about it as they are still treated better than women of color. Yet, health, a basic human right, should not be dictated by one\u2019s zip code or the color of their skin.\n\n\n\nReferences\nCena, L.,Mirabella, F., Palumbo, G. et al. (2020).

        "text": "850614296\nSOC 105 \n4/7/23\n \nFrom the Perspective of \u201cOther\u201d\n\nTap, Tap, tap\u2026 straighten posture, shift weight, keep eyes down, no, keep your eyes up, be confident, smile, look approachable. These are the many thoughts that circle a woman's mind while walking down the street. Billboards and magazines of the ideal woman's physique at every turn, unable to escape the perfection of the surrounding. Above the want for gentle eyes, silky hair, and radiant skin, there's one factor that far outweighs the desire of my appearance and want of the \u201cmale gaze.\u201d The thought so frequently pops into my head of what it would be like to have the respect and stature as that of a man. Since the beginning of time, women have been dissimilar, supplementary and seen as \u201cother\u201d to the male sex. With no independent history, culture, or belief system, women have been in the shadow of man, supporting one's goals, aiding in their needs, and providing in any way achievable. \nSince coming to UNCW I have visited the Recreation Center an average of four days a week give or take. Wednesday, February 8th, 2023, I approached the Rec Center eager to start my workout. After completing my five sets on the leg press, I approached the young man on the squat rack and asked, \u201cHey man, how many sets do you have left?\u201d He responds, \u201cOh, I just started a new workout, so four to five sets.\u201d With a smile on my face, I answered, \u201cOkay. May you please let me know when you\u2019re done? Thank you!\u201d After walking away, not two minutes go by, and the young man sees what I assume to be his friend and gives him the rack. Although a little shocked, and thrown off by this interaction, I brushed it off. I then approached the only other squat rack in the gym and proposed to the man the same question. After being looked at from head to toe, he informs me that he has two sets left. Walking away, I watch the same event transpire. Giving another man the rack, my jaw drops in disbelief. Staring at the situation before me, I was puzzled. Thinking of all the possible reasons why one would not allow another a simple request, I struggled to come to a single conclusion. A couple days went by, and I spoke to one of my male friends that lives in my dorm, who also actively attends the gym. That\u2019s when it hit me. I questioned, \u201cHow do I earn the respect of a man?\u201d His head tilted abruptly, paused for a minute and mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d As a man who often makes jokes about gender differences whether that be \u201cwomen can\u2019t drive\u201d or \u201cwomen wear clothes for men, not for themselves,\u201d he was not pleased with the treatment I was experiencing at the gym.\nRaised in a divided home with a dominating father and a goal driven mother, I saw the many conflicts that not playing your \u201cgender role\u201d creates. My father informed me from a young age of a woman's role in society. The caretakers of the household and appeal to the man's eye. Since 2nd grade, I have desired a career in the medical field, specifically, a medical doctor.  These desires were constantly shot down as my father would say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t become a doctor, you won\u2019t have time for family, for your kids. Why not be a nurse?\u201d He attempted to condition me to dress, speak, and portray myself as something to be advertised and admired by others. I can\u2019t tell you the countless times I've heard, \u201cthat isn\u2019t ladylike.\u201d In comparison, my mother taught me that I am capable of anything permitting I put in the work\u2026 until I wanted to join the military, then all bets were off. Women that stray from their gender role and lack the desire to conform are put in undesirable positions in regard to relationships and profession. If surrounded in a male dominated environment, there will always be something to prove, because after all who wants the girl on their team. \nSimone de Beauvoir, writer, activist, and social theorist focuses many of her pieces on women, most notably, \u201cSecond Sex.\u201d She voices how women are viewed in comparison to men and how naturally speaking women are the inferior sex and always have been. In 1949, Beauvoir explained women's place, when expressing, \u201cThey live dispersed among men tied by homes, work...to certain men-fathers or husbands-more closely than to other women \u201d (pg-261). As a tactic of control, men have kept women separate, focusing their attention to the kitchen, the house, and the children. Without any purpose independently, there is an attachment that is created that ensures that a woman would not survive without the economic stability of a man. Due to the lack of financial contribution, women have had to compensate with their appearance, cooking skills, and physical affection for a man. A woman's purpose has been to serve, whether that be their husbands or their fathers, but never themselves. Self-interest is a pleasure not given, as every other member in their household takes priority. In addition to that, on page 260, Simone quotes the famous Aristotle, \u201cThe female is female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities\u201d (Woman as Other). In this section of the piece, Beauvoir quotes many respected men in their fields, all of them displaying women as something to be conquered, lesser, and defective. Right off the bat, women have been almost pitied for their ignorance and have played the role of the underdog for far too long. Without quality education, resources, and equal opportunity how would one expect a man and a woman to possess the same qualities, skills, and experiences at that time. Marilyn Frye had an excellent analogy for comparing oppression to a bird in a cage. Being caught in metal bars or wires, restricts one's ability to spread their wings and flourish.  No matter how many times one chirps or chitters, the barrier set in place by the bars allows the system (men) to observe with leisure, benefiting from the beauty, while the decoration remains trapped inside. \nAs time has gone on and women have strayed from their household duties, there is a new problem underway. In an attempt to control women, there is a new war in place, women against women. Naomi Wolf provides insight on the new struggles women encounter when stating, \u201c...attractive, successful working women, there is a secret \u201cunderlife\u201d poisoning our freedom ; infused with notions of beauty\u2026 self-hatred, physical obsessions, terror of aging, and dread of lost control\u201d (pg. 1). Every place you go there is an illustration of this in society. Women often speak of getting botox, liposuction, fake tans, and other aesthetic procedures. Girls in high school are even infected with this desire, as they chase the appearance and attention of the women they see on social media. The gossip of putting others down for their bodies, continues, as the standard of beauty increases. If you haven\u2019t heard, the attraction scale has changed from the 1-10 rating to 1-30 to account for breasts, face, and derriere. Pornography has climbed to the top of the ladder for mainstream media. As women have begun to advance in society, attend college at higher rates than men, fight for higher level positions of power, one more factor of control had to be computed to once again seclude and create a barrier of division between women across the country, and the world. \nThrough experience and evaluation of the society around me, I have come to realize that the concept of earning the respect of a man is unattainable. Upon seeing an individual, there are certain perceptible characteristics including age, race, and sex. Before a word even slips off one's tongue, perceptions have already been made based on their physical appearance and overall presentation.  Women around the world continue to feed into this perpetual sequence by upholding the standards of the beauty myth. Conforming to the expectations will forever yield the same undesirable results. Women often talk about how upsetting it is to be treated with such lack of kindness and respect by men but take it without refusals like they\u2019ve been conditioned to. I too have played my own part in this debacle, however in recent times I have gained a deeper perspective regarding the identification of where these issues stem and the potential solutions to these problems. This pattern continues because the men and women in this society that are raising their children are doing a poor job of straying from the collective consciousness and the double standards held to each sex. My mother still tells me to not go out at night, still asks me if I have pepper spray on my keychain. My stepfather, a man's opinion I hold in high regard, told me that I should not step off campus alone, that I should bring a \u201cfriend\u201d, but we all know when he said that he meant male friend. \nThis is the problem of our generation and the generations before us. There is an undeniable power struggle of respect between men and women and mothers and fathers have aided in this neglect. Children are only as skilled as we give them space to be. Having different standards for your opposite sex children causes boys to think girls are not capable, not competent, and not trusted. That is why when a woman does something as well or better than a man, all eyes are on her. The beauty myth and expectation of performing one's role denies a woman her full potential. Discouragement from family, friends, and peers does not create a supporting environment to breed success. Whereas a man has been raised to believe he will accomplish great things and be an author of his own destiny. This superiority complex plays a role in our everyday interactions. Whether that be the classroom, grocery store, household, or the gym, one does not escape it. \nIn addition to that, without respect for one's wishes and values held dear to them, consent has become a major dilemma of this parental and societal failure. Without the necessary backing from a young age, regarding the utility of men and women, the \u201cother\u201d sex has been exploited and made as a tool to serve man's sexual desires and cravings.  The thrill of the chase, the anticipation of the capture, this animal behavior has been tolerated for far too long. Regardless of the regulations that have been established in workplaces, women still face many issues of respect from their male coworkers, customers, and employers. What appears to be a never-ending cycle is in fact just another representation of the lack of respect across the country and the world for women as the \u201cincidental\u201d being.  A man should be equally afraid of a woman as he is a man, and a woman should know that she is capable of more than being just another pretty face. \nIn conclusion, women have been thrown into a box of seclusion and limitation since the beginning of time. The expectations set in the Stone Age still hold true today and the generations to come will continue to encounter these issues of unbalanced respect. Without the change of the collective consciousness spread throughout society regarding the role of a man vs the role of a woman and parental standards, the fight of oppression will always be a losing battle. As the fight goes on, measurements will be taken to continue to control women whether that be their role, job opportunities, appearance, or the community within us. The ability and respect of an individual should not be determined by what is between their legs, but between their ears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \n\nMinas, Anne.

        "text": "SOC 105-001\nOctober 18, 2021\nGender in Today\u2019s World\n\tHave you ever been outcasted because something that you liked was deemed too masculine or too feminine for you to like?  Many people face a time in their lives where this occurs.  Whether it be a boy that likes the color pink and to play with dolls or a girl who likes the color blue and to play football.  Society has created these ideas that each gender must follow an extremely rigid set of rules to be seen as \u201cnormal\u201d within the society.  When someone does something outside of these rules people are hesitant to accept their actions because it has been ingrained in their minds that their actions are \u201cwrong.\u201d   Every day we unknowingly do things because of these societal set of rules.  When we alter our natural behavior to fit into what society deems acceptable, we are \u201cdoing gender.\u201d   We are taught by society that there are specific actions and behaviors that we have that are directly related to our sex even though science has proven that there are not very many biological differences between males and females.  The perceptions of male and female that society has taught us since we were young enables us to be more skeptical to try things outside of the rules of our specific gender. \n\tDespite the presence of gender roles and rules of masculinity and femininity, the world we live in today has been more progressive towards the idea that gender is socially constructed and can be done in different ways.  Society has become more welcoming to the idea of women working in male dominated fields and men fulfilling home duties which in the past were viewed as abnormal and strange.  People are more equipped to challenge the rules of gender because of the sociologic research done to prove the socially construction of gender.  When people start to realize gender is a social construct, it is much easier to question the sexist thoughts that we have been taught.  One is able to tell themselves that their perception of what is acceptable as a man, or a woman has only been constructed by society not science and that if they are to defy the gender norm they are not biologically or inherently different than their peers.  I am not trying to argue that our society has completely overcome the sexism that gender norms have inflicted, but I believe there has been significant progress in questioning gender norms.  Although gender roles/norms are still present in society today, there has been more acceptance with defying the rules of gender.\n\tIn the past, the roles of men and women were very different than those of today.  We can see how far feminism and breaking gender roles has come since the late 1800s by looking at Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s article titled \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper.\u201d  In this article, Gilman describes a fictional experience of a woman going through a depressive episode.  She explains how her husband, who is a doctor that diagnosed her illness, has been dismissing all of her opinions and not allowing her to do the things she likes to do like writing.  The readers can tell that the husband is belittling her and has a dominance over her.  The woman in the story feels like she owes the husband because he has taken care of her and given her a house to live in, but she is also aware of how poorly he treats her and that it is not fair to her.  The readers start to get frustrated with the woman because they know she deserves to be treated better but she continues to make excuses for the husband.  Gilman wants her female readers to see that they are actually the woman in the story, and it is time to stand up for themselves.  She wants them to fight the gender rules that say that women are supposed to stay at home and are not supposed to do anything without the approval of a man.  During this time period, women were not viewed as equal citizens, but Gilman\u2019s article was a very influential piece in helping women realize they deserve equality.  The gender rules during this time period were so rigid that they were embedded in the justice system.  Women did not have rights to own property or vote and were seen as objects in the eyes of the law, not people.  Defying the gender norms as a woman in this time period would be as simple as wanting to make your own decisions.  Women that did not want to be controlled by a man and did not get married would be outcasts in society.  They would often fail to be able to support themselves because the system was built to benefit the man, not the woman.  Fortunately, things are vastly different in today\u2019s world due to the persistence and fight of the women before us.  Now, a woman owning her own house and making a livable income is possible and seen as something pretty normal.  The societal view as to what a woman can do has majorly shifted from the late 1800s to now. \nWomen have come very far in gaining rights to work our way to being seen as equal to men, but there are still areas and environments where women are still seen as inferior and not belonging.  When I was in high school, while taking a weight training class I faced several moments of resistance to me defying gender norms.  This weight training class was predominantly male, and I also had a male teacher.  On the first day of class, I could feel a lot of stares and it made me feel like I did not belong.  I was not doing gender in the way that was typical in society.  Instead of taking a class that was deemed more feminine, like art or dance, I wanted to take a class where I could get stronger and learn more about weightlifting which was deemed masculine.  After the initial hesitance to having a female in their class, the other boys in the class came to accept the idea that a girl could do well in the class.  I took this opportunity to enlighten the boys in my class and show them that girls can be strong and interested in weightlifting too.  Despite the original pushback from my classmates and teacher, I was still able to make strong relationships with the people in the class.  As the class went on, I got really close with the teacher and made some really close friends.  In this experience, I was able to see firsthand the hesitancy society has instilled in people to a person breaking gender norms, but I also saw that people are capable of overcoming their learned perceptions.  Although I did face some isolation by breaking a gender norm, my experience was very different from other women that came before me.  When women in the late 1800s did something against the gender rules that society had set for them, they were completely outcasted from society or would face major punishments.  I use this example to show that there are still gender norms that need to be defied in today\u2019s society to improve equality, but I also want to shed light on the fact that my experience in defying gender norms is vastly less consequential than those of the women of the late 1800s. \nAlthough I have focused mainly on women defying gender roles in this paper, men also face scrutiny when they defy gender roles.  Similarly to women, the intensity of the criticism men face in today\u2019s world seems to be less than in the past.  For example, when boys would do cheerleading in the 1980s-90s they would be ridiculed for doing something that was \u201conly for girls.\u201d  They would be accused of being \u201cgay\u201d for doing cheer because they were acting too feminine.  They would also be told that they were only doing cheerleading because they were too weak to play a \u201creal sport.\u201d  The boys that did cheerleading would face a lot of hate because of the hegemonic masculinity that was ingrained in so many people.  The fact that these boys were doing gender in a different way resulted in so much pushback.  I have been involved in cheerleading for most of my life and I have seen how these criticisms that men face when they come into the sport have evolved.  I have had several male coaches that cheered during the time where they were teased for cheerleading but have told me that overtime as more people learn about cheerleading and as it grows in popularity, society has started to change their perspective. In my experience, males have been very welcomed into the cheerleading community.  In today\u2019s world, people are more inclined to see the boys that do cheerleading for their talent and the strength that it takes to be a cheerleader, instead of focusing on how they are defying a gender norm.  At my high school, the boys that cheered on my team were loved by our student section and from my perspective it seemed like they did not get teased or harassed for being cheerleaders.  I definitely believe some people face more scrutiny when they come into cheerleading, depending on the open-mindedness of their community, but overall, I think society has come to more widely accept male cheerleaders.  Over time, as people become more educated, they are able to grow and come to realize that their perceptions of others should be made based on the individual, not the generalization that society has created for a specific group of people. \nDefying gender roles or norms that are harmful is important for the growth of society.\nPeople should not have to alter their natural behavior and interests to fit into society\u2019s box that defines how they should act based on their sex.  Defying gender norms and doing gender in your own way can be seen as an ongoing accomplishment as described by Candance West and Don H. Zimmerman in their article \u201cDoing Gender\u201d since it has the ability to alter society.  In the past, women worked to defy gender norms to gain their human rights.  Society has also shifted to become more accepting of men participating in activities previously deemed feminine.  In today\u2019s world, society has become more accepting of people defying gender norms because they are becoming more aware that gender is something we have learned and do each day, not something we are hardwired to do.  Making this realization allows for people to understand that the roles men and women are supposed to play are made up and socially constructed.  Although society has come a long way from the late 1800s when sexism was embedded into the judicial system, we still face hesitancy and pushback when someone defies a gender norm. ",

        "text": "7852\n\t       Is the United States Becoming a Nation of Less Diversity Than We Think?\n\tYou don\u2019t have to be an expert to see that the United States has had its fair share of a discriminatory past. Yet leaders and citizens today call the US a \u201cmelting pot\u201d, a place where everyone is welcome, and people of all different cultural backgrounds come to thrive. But how true is that statement? Sociology studies and ideas have come to show that maybe the US isn\u2019t as inclusive and welcoming as we might have thought. Two of these sociology topics that highlight this discrepancy is a research study done on discrimination in a low-wage labor markets and an observation of low, middle, and upper classes by Mantsios. \nThe research study that was done was conducted by three scholars of sociology in order to investigate the discrimination in a low-wage labor market. The research study was to study whether or not discrimination is present in the low-wage communities of New York City when applying for a job in those areas. The research method that is used to address the research question is both quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative research the researchers conducted an experiment based on having white, black, and Latino applicants submit resumes. The qualitative research was based on what the applicants resumes contained. The findings address the question of whether there was discrimation because it shows which percentage of applicants got the job and whether or not there was bias involved. It showed that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback, or a job offer. A real-world example of this type of discrimination is when going into a restaurant a lot of times you may see that the hosts and waiters a lot of time are white, while the cooks and \u201cback-stage\u201d employees are of different racial backgrounds. The descrimination \u201cmechanisms\u201d that were observed during the interview process were categorical exclusion, shifting standards, and race-coded job channeling. Categorical exclusion is the immediate or automatic rejection of the black applicant in favor of a white candidate. Shifting standards is described as evaluation being actively shaped or constructed through a racial lens. Lastly, race-coded job channeling is a process by which minority applicants are steered toward particular job types. This research study in whole showed that racial discrimination is still so prominent in todays world. \nGregory Mantsios comes to bring to light class oppression, class privileges, and the class nature of society within the United States. Mantsios talks about the ins and outs of three families living in the United States and their class within society. The first family seems very affluent, and their activities don\u2019t really match \u201cmiddle-class\u201d it\u2019s more upper class (salary is very high). This family does very expensive trips overseas regularly, are very well-respected in their community, and the father\u2019s job is an executive at a good company. The second family does seem more \u201cmiddle-class\u201d because they spend time together and vacation, but not as luxurious as the first family (salary is middle-class). The third family seems more lower-class as the father and mother work a waitressing and janitorial job. Their salary is also very low. The main argument of Mantsios is that there is not a pretty picture of our country. Despite what we would like to think about our nation, opportunity and life in the United States is highly dependent on our race, gender, and the class we are born into. Also, as individuals we are hurt by injustice, but as a society we tolerate it. One real-world example that happens a lot in our world is that people born into more upper-class or prominent families go into positions of power like the government. This leads our government to be not as diverse in backgrounds, class, and beliefs as it should be. In order to fix these issues, there needs to be a radical redistribution of power and wealth. Just like the research study Mantsios\u2019s research showed that discrimination whether racial or societal, the United States is not as much of a \u201cmelting pot\u201d as we would like to seem. The research study showed a different type of discrimination, but in its basics, they are the same and show our country in a really negative light. \nDiscrimination remains a pervasive issue in the United States, despite progress made in civil rights movements. Systemic biases persist in various forms, including racial, gender, LGBTQ+, and economic discrimination. Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted approaches. Firstly, fostering education and awareness about unconscious biases is crucial. Implementing anti-discrimination laws and enforcing them rigorously is essential to hold individuals and institutions accountable. Additionally, promoting diversity and inclusion in workplaces and communities can help dismantle discriminatory practices. It's imperative to amplify marginalized voices and prioritize policies that uplift underrepresented groups. Lastly, fostering empathy and understanding through dialogue and empathy-building initiatives can contribute to creating a more equitable society. By tackling discrimination comprehensively and inclusively, we can strive towards a future where all individuals are valued and treated with dignity and respect.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sociology 105-001\nOctober 18, 2021\nThe Conception of Self Perception\n\tHow we as humans perceive ourselves is a very interesting concept. Have you ever wondered why you or a given entity will act a certain way in accordance to the environment of that said entity? Likewise, have you wondered how different social interactions can affect the way you would consider yourself to \u201cnormally behave\u201d. There are numerous reasons and scenarios that could influence one\u2019s behavior. Multiple sociologists have put their minds to the cause and through a broader view of the \u201cSelf\u201d they have touched on the conception of self perception. It is through their writings and ideals that we will dissect how we as humans view ourselves and in some cases why we change ourselves and our behaviors to appropriately fit the occasion.\n\tThe idea of conception of self perception is simply formulating an idea of how we view ourselves.  We then get an idea of the reasoning behind our actions through looking at concepts provided by sociologists,  psychologists, and looking at examples of social interactions. There is an embedded system in our neurological working that self-consciously tells us how we should act, react, and where to place ourselves socially in a group. However, I am essentially challenging the idea that humans are in complete control over their actions and reactions. But, \u201cHow can anything other than the way I perceive myself, be the real me? Who is more me than me?\u201d You are you, however, it is through a system of selves and social shields for certain situations that the \u201creally real you\u201d has manifested its residing. Perhaps it is more correct to say that the pure self is not what put these selves in place, but that past experiences have developed a better social construct. Whether it is in the soul, heart, or brain there is a pure self that defines who we are. The decisions we make in social interaction are affected by past experiences from which the pure self has learned and will integrate over time. At the end of the day the \u201cyou\u201d that you perceive as \u201cyou\u201d is only a part of the overall self that has been developed to fit a social interaction. So how does this occur?\n\tGeorge Herbert Mead is a sociologist who uses the idea of the different selves to emphasize  his own idea of the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cMe\u201d. He explains the selves as essentially being the different \u201cyou\u2019s\u201d you have for social situations. He demonstrates this idea when he says, \u201cWe carry out a whole series of different relationships to different people. We are one thing to one man and another thing to another\u2026 We divide ourselves up in all sorts of different ways with reference to our acquaintances. We discuss politics with one and religion with another. There are all sorts of different selves answering to all sorts of different social reactions.\u201d, (Mead, 164). In this way, there are multiple parts to the self. Those parts make up what is referred to as the pure self, and these selves allow us to think of ourselves in whatever way we want to perceive ourselves in social situations. Think of it like this: one will act accordingly in the given environment. One doesn't act the same going in for a job interview as for a family Christmas get-together.  This is because the self has evolved from previous experiences. Accordingly, we know when to be more professional with our actions and when it is ok to be more laid back. It is because of this fact that the \u201cyou\u201d, as you perceive yourself, is not what is in control of your social interactions. In fact a form of the pure self known as the social self is in control and is what drives us to act a certain way. The social self is the identity gifted upon an individual from the reactions of others, giving birth to social tendencies as an individual. Through this we learn what is and is not appropriate in a social situation. This is also why those who have more experience with social interactions are less socially awkward than those who have not learned from the social self. The social self is just one example of the different \u201cselves'' that make up the pure self; however, it is the self most responsible as to why we react the way we do during social interactions.\n\tDespite the acceptance of the different selves that give insight into social interactions, there remains a belief that \u201cI am as a human in control of my actions\u201d. Essentially, the disbelief in the driving self provided through learned experiences. This type of logic is somewhat narrow minded. For example, when something scary happens the natural tendency is to run away. What triggered the tendency to run? The more narrow minded person would say, \u201cI ran away because I wanted to get away from the scary thing, because I wanted to\u201d. The sociological answer attributes the response to \u201cfight or flight\u201d, a response brought about from the parasympathetic nervous system when we perceive something to be dangerous. The key word here is \u201cperceive\u201d. The self told you it would be best to run from the unknown thing because past experiences have conditioned you to perceive the thing as scary. The reason the idea of humans being in absolute control of their actions/reactions is improbable is because nobody lives in a vacuum from reality. In other words, the idea suggests someone who has no knowledge of human interaction would react the same as someone who has grown up in society. To put this in perspective let\u2019s look at two scenarios. Two children grow up differently, one child is in a fruitful middle class family home. This child loves Mickey Mouse, his parents get him Mickey Mouse themed merchandise, he watches the movies, etc. The child grows up seeing Mickey Mouse as a child friendly idol. In contrast, the other child is isolated from society living his whole existence in a box with no stimulation from anything or anyone. What if one day both the isolated child and the family child are surprised with their arrival at Disney World? The family child is blindfolded  and the isolated child is in his box upon entrance to the Magic Kingdom. What happens when the outside world is revealed and there stands Mickey Mouse? Isn't the answer ridiculously obvious? The child who grew up knowing Mickey Mouse would  be excited while the isolated child would shrink back into his  only known world that is the box from fright of this freaky human sized animalistic being. No matter what you believe is true, this is basically the outcome that would happen. Sociological belief would predict this outcome. The family child knew who Mickey Mouse was. He was taught through experience that Mickey Mouse is his friend. The isolated child never heard of Mickey Mouse so he was frightened by the unknown and would attempt to run and hide. However, the belief in the idea that humans are in complete control and social background has nothing to do with their reactions presumes the two children should react the same. According to this reasoning, past experiences are not reflected in \u201cin the moment\u201d decisions which is the flaw in this type of thinking. The two children in this scenario would undoubtedly not have the same reaction.\n\tThe obvious question is, \u201cwhy?\u201d. \u201cWhy does our environment and background affect our behaviors? Why do we feel compelled to act a certain way when faced with certain situations?\u201d There are a few concepts that can answer this question, and they are all rooted in self-perception. The way we view ourselves is a driving factor in how we present ourselves. There are essentially three ways of viewing yourself: there is how you directly view yourself, how others view you, and how you perceive others to view you. To put this in perspective, for a moment pretend You are a 10 year old child. You race your mom and she lets you win without you realizing it. She comments, \u201cwow baby you\u2019re so fast!\u201d This starts to make you think you must be the fastest person in the world and this is how you view yourself. From your mom\u2019s perspective, of course, she knows she let you win and you are most definitely not the fastest person in the world, this is someone else\u2019s perspective of you. However, due to the fact you can\u2019t read minds you have no idea this is the true perspective. All you know is that you left your mom in the dust and she is very impressed with you. This is your perspective of how you think others perceive you. Self perception is a powerful influencer on how to present yourself. As stated earlier humans are unable to read minds so we are only going to focus on self perception of yourself, through your own eyes and how you think others perceive you. \n    Firstly, self-perception through your own eyes is the subject of William James, a psychologist who uses sociological ideas to explain how we perceive ourselves. James describes the breakdown of the \u201cself\u201d into three key parts that help relate how you see yourself. James says the self is broken down into the social self, spiritual self, and material self. In short summary, the spiritual self is the personality, the social self is you defined in a social situation, and the material self is you expanding the self onto inanimate objects such as clothes, or a soccer ball. (For example, when you score a goal you say \u201cI made it in!\u201d when really the soccer ball made it in). James\u2019 describes the idea of the self as, \u201cWe see then that we are dealing with a fluctuating material; the same object being sometimes treated as part of me, at other times as simply mine, and then again as if I had nothing to do with it at all. In its widest possible sense however, a man\u2019s Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers but his clothes and his house, his wife\u2026 All these things give him the same emotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down-not necessarily in the same degree for each thing. Understand the Self in the widest sense, we may begin dividing the history of it into three parts, relating respectively to:\n1.Its constituents \n2. The feelings and emotions they arouse-- Self feelings;\n3. The actions which they prompt-- Self-seeking and self-preservation\u201d, (James, The Self and its Selves, 123). The constituents according to James are the material, spiritual, and social self, along with the pure ego (most closely relating to the soul). Through this we see that James\u2019 breakdown of the self into its constituents is used to provide self perception in which the self occurs over a three-step process: stimuli is received through one of the constituents, it is transferred into the brain, and the product is produced as behavior. This is how perception of ourselves through our own eyes is made. However, perception of ourselves based on how we think others see us is a different process.\n\tSecondly, self perception based on how we think others see us, is uniquely explained by psychologist, Charles Horton Cooley. Cooley\u2019s views are very sociological and emphasizes how we rely heavily on social acceptance when making a decision. A good example of this is the decision making process that happens when choosing an outfit to wear in public. For the most part, humans feel inclined to choose outfits that will yield compliments. When picking out an outfit many of us begin to fantasize about people saying \u201cwow nice look today!\u201d  The pride generated by such a compliment will in turn cause us to continue to choose outfits that we think others would enjoy rather than one that may not result in such credit. This excerpt from Cooley\u2019s, \u201cThe Looking-Glass self\u201d sums it up the best, \u201cA self-idea of this sort seems to have three principal elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment, which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another\u2019s mind. This is evident from the fact that the character and weight of that other, in whose mind we see ourselves, makes all the difference with our feeling, We are ashamed to seem evasive in the presence of a straightforward man, cowardly in the presence of a brave one, gross in the eyes of a refined one and so on. We always imagine and in imagining, share, the judgement of the other mind. A man will boast to one person of an action say some sharp transaction in trade--which he would be ashamed to own to another.\u201d (Cooley, The Looking-Glass Self, 142) As evidenced in the excerpt Cooley\u2019s ideals are heavily reliant on the idea of social interaction. Stating that our actions can be rooted back to how we think others might think of us. With the introduction of his idea of self perception Cooley also introduced a new sort of Self. This reinforces the idea that there are a series of selves that control our thinking when taking an action or making a decision.\n\tThrough the minds of William James, and Charles Horton Cooley, we were able to see the two different self perceptions in action. It is by breaking down the self into three selves all accounting for \u201cyou\u201d in different areas of sociality, and by introducing a new or different self that we should consider how others might perceive us. The concepts work together but also apart from each other to show that we as humans are not as decisive on our own as we may think. Regardless of what you might think of this philosophy, there is no doubt that at some point in the reading of this paper there was realization or a connection that was made. These concepts were formed from critical thinking of life experiences to better understand how our \u201cselves\u201d behave in situations. Perhaps after reading this idea new ideas have started to form. We are a forever evolving species. Our neurological network is always learning and improving.\n\nWorks Cited\n\u201cThe self and It\u2019s selves\u201d - William James (1890)- Pg. 123-124 https://uncw.instructure.com/courses/47795/files/4819452?wrap=1\n\n\t\u201cThe Looking-Glass Self\u201d - Charles Horton Cooley (1902)- Pg. 142 https://uncw.instructure.com/courses/47795/files/4819453?wrap=1\n\n\t\u201cThe Self, the I, and the Me\u201d - George Herbert Mead (ca. 1929)- Pg. 164  https://uncw.instructure.com/courses/47795/files/4819464?wrap=1\n\n\n",

I worked for a custard chain that was already grossly overpriced, despite starting all of its employees at minimum wage. After having been at my job for approximately six months, the custard prices increased. However, my co-workers and I did not receive raises. Instead, it negatively affected our income. Some of our regular customers who would typically tip us were frustrated that we were not allowed to charge them as we typically would. Due to this, they did not leave a tip. While those tips weren\u2019t a significant portion of our income, we performed an equal amount and level of work, while the company received more, and we experienced an income loss. Furthermore, our job was not glorious enough that we would have gone and worked for free. Therefore, we were frustrated by our job, and the company continuously got more money, while its employees remained a slave to their jobs.\n\n\tThose who hold the most funds have their money increase in value, while laborers continuously feel their money getting taken away. Despite how stingy a worker is with their income, they will always have to work to earn more. While this leaves them a slave to their work, their work is not satisfying enough to make them happy. However, they work so much that they do not have time left for the activities they do enjoy, leaving them weary and depressed. \n\n",

Collection consciousness has been around since the beginning of time but was fully discovered by Emile Durheim, who also said that individuals have the same kind of morality to fit in.  The first occurrences of collective consciousness in society emerged with religion and has kept growing. Religion has grown all across the world and spread through groups of people wanted to share their beliefs.\n             \n               Concurring to the \u201cNeurology of Religion\u201d, the human brain got to be more cleverly able to think with the complexity as we created enthusiastic profundity. Along with the movement of the human intellect, the collective consciousness was able to create as well.\n There are unknown distinctive considerations almost the collective awareness and its unwavering quality. In spite of the fact that, it has been broadly backed and acknowledged over time numerous events have been found. Numerous European nations once got to be persuaded of the presence of a pixie known as a changeling, who would seize children from their families and supplant themselves with another version of themselves after stories had been shared inside communities for a long time. The point is that there does not have to be something tangible or even the ability for someone to see in something to believe in it. All something requires is the belief from a group of people, a community of people. Agreeing to the \u201cMicro foundations\u201d perusing, the primary known illustrations of the collective consciousness were when burial and craftsmanship culture had risen. The time individuals went through shaping dot after bead for their loved ones to wear within the graves may be a conviction framework built up based on shared stories and encounters of the great beyond. With the movement of the human intellect through history, their memory was upgraded and permitted for people to have complex contemplations have form religions. This shows how powerful a belief system can be and how much action can be done with just a group belief of how to do life. \n\n                  As our brains have matured so has our capacity to consider what others say and how to respond has ended up being known as the collective consciousness. In spite of their being a number of diverse shrewdly primates, people are set up differently because of their capacity to fundamentally think for the overall group and consider what is best for everyone. Numerous diverse illustrations of this way of making this idea develop all throughout history permitting the collective consciousness to be a trusted hypothesis utilized by numerous sociologists.  \n \u201cMicrofoundations\u201d by Fligstein and MacAdams (Read only pages 35-45; stopping at the section entitled \"Social Skill.\")\nPodcast:\u00a0Lore, and this is Episode 11, entitled \"Black Stockings.\"\n\u201cThe Neurology of Religion.\u201d Maryanski and Turner\n\"The Cultural Logic and Collective Representations\" by Emile Durkheim\n\n    \n\n            ",

        "text": "1874\n\tDigging deeper into labor in the fast-food industry, George Ritzer came up with the concept of McDonaldization. McDonaldization is the general overlook at how rationalization affected the food service industry. Companies like McDonalds found ways around human labor to make more profit while saving time and money. Industrialization played a huge role in this, especially with the use of mass factory production that cut down on the need to pay employees. Another aspect of McDonaldization is the way fast food chains have created a sufficient, cheap process in order to sell as many products in as much time as possible. Ever been to a fast food restaurant and gotten your food in under two minutes? This is thanks to the \u201cMedialization\u201d of fast food. Cheap products combined with cheap labor and profitable prices is the recipe for success for fast food businesses like McDonalds, Wendy\u2019s, etc. \n\tMcDonaldization is a prime example of what Marx talks about in capitalism, especially referring to estranged labor. Because of the McDonaldization of the fast-food industry, employees\u2019 labor became even less valuable to companies. Most fast-food establishments pay their workers minimum wage in exchange for their work, which is nowhere near the kind of profits the companies are making off of their product. An average McDonald\u2019s makes around 2.7 million dollars per year. An average employee making $11/hour working 40 hours a week earns about 0.8% of that store\u2019s profit. This is where Marx\u2019s estranged labor comes in, because the product doesn\u2019t belong to the working-class laborers, it belongs to the power elite companies and company owners who are profiting from their cheap labor. Because capitalism is such a foundational part of the American economy, estranged labor is never going to be done away with. It\u2019s everywhere you look. Not just McDonaldization, but in all types of stores. The girl at the mall folding clothes in Urban Outfitters isn\u2019t making profit off you buying their outrageously overpriced shirts. The factory workers for American Eagle sewing clothes together aren\u2019t getting paid based on how many sweaters get sold. Estranged labor is all around us.\n\tWhen looking at Karl Marx ideas of capitalism regarding low-wage labor and estranged labor, the idea of McDonaldization fits right in as an example of how laborers are not profiting from their work. In turn, the power elites who run these massive fast food companies are becoming more and more wealthy at the expense of the working class who are just trying to stay afloat\u2014therefore trading their labor for cheap wages. Marx opened the doors for people to see the problems with capitalism, especially in the labor market, and George Ritzer\u2019s concept of McDonaldization fits perfectly into it. \n\t\n\n",

        "text": "\n           Growing up I would consider my friends, their families, and my own family to be middle class, but after reading \u201cclass in America \u201cby Mantsios, that seems to be far from the truth. He argues that the middle class makes up just a tiny percent of Americans, which is surprising because I tend to think most people I know are in the middle class. this goes to show how twisted our perception of class has become, and how much Americans really don\u2019t understand how segregated our social class system is. Mantsios states in his fourth reality that, \u201cFrom cradle to grave, class standing has a significant impact on our chances for survival\u201d, which I honestly didn\u2019t think was true before. This statement reminds me if when I was younger, riding in the car, and we would pass homeless people and I would ask \u201cwhy are these people asking for money?\u201d, and usually whoever was driving would reply with \u201cthey don't need money they could just go out and get a job.\u201d Meanwhile, I know that some people do put themselves in that situation, but most grew up into it and are stuck in this lower class of having nothing. I feel like my generation has grown up in the collective consciousness that you can make anything happen if you put your mind to it, and sadly that's not necessarily true. \n         The chances of making it from the bottom to the top are pictured as one in a million. Why, you ask? It's because the people at the top hold the power and continue to hold the power. Domhoff defines this group of people as the \u201cpower elite\u201d, throwing light on the fat that they control many organizations and have their best interest in mind.  This also meaning that this group has the power to appoint certain people to certain rolls and jobs that hold high importance. This ensures that the high-power roles are filled by people who will be in their favor when making decisions. Although, the power in America seems to be decided by a Democratic vote, it is exposed that in reality the power roles are already chosen by the same people who hold them. \n\n        As a nation we decide to disregard that social classes prevents people born into a lower class to be able to achieve the status of being in the upper class. It is clear that people who hold the power like their power and do not want to give it up, keeping the same cycle of people who dominate control. The truths of social class have been sugarcoated in the classroom and have brought us up to believe that the social class we were born in doesn\u2019t refrains us from achieving the social class we strive to be in, when it is proven that it in fact does. \n\n\n\u201cPower in America.\u201d Who Rules America: The Class-Domination Theory of Power, whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/class_domination.html#power_elite. \n\n Mantsios, Gregory  (2006), \u201cSocial Class in America\u201d \n",

        "text": "In America, from the day we are born, we learn that there is a power dynamic - a race-based hierarchy we must all follow. This power dynamic determines life opportunities, privileges, and obligations. In \u201cThe Presentation of Self,\u201d Goffman explains that social interactions are a massive performance in which everyone has a role to play, whether major or minor. In\u201cRacial Formations,\u201d Omi and Winant present racial formation, which has since been ingrained into this performance to determine the role each character receives. In American society, one\u2019s race decides their character role, which will determine how society views them. \n\n\nThe white race has been seen as the dominant race, performing the dominant role, for centuries now. It will take more than an individual character to change that, as a single individual trying to disrupt the hierarchy will just be placed at the bottom of the power structure. To change the practices that have been in place since hypo-descent, and eradicate subordinate roles, we must collectively decide to change the performance and character roles as a country. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105\n28 April 2021\nRacial Biases in Employment\n\tHave you ever been turned down for a job that you were extremely qualified for? Have you ever made less money than a coworker with the same credentials? If this sounds outrageous, it is way more common than you may think. Since 1990, white applicants received 36% more callbacks from a job interview than black applicants, and 24% more than Latino applicants with the same level r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (Quillian). There has been a racial bias in the hiring process for decades. People are turned down for jobs they are highly qualified for based on their racial background and upbringing. Determination of whether or not a person gets a job and the wage they make should not be based on the color of their skin.\n\tRace has been a determining factor in many different cases on whether someone gets a job or not, whether or not people want to admit that. It also plays a factor in how much money they make from a job compared to their white coworkers. In a study done by Jud and Walker, a survey was conducted on 1,215 blue-collared males aged 18-28\u2014consisting of 1,001 whites and 214 blacks\u2014looking at their IQ, schooling, and earnings. The results were separated into low-social status and high-social status categories and then into black and white subcategories. The social status was based on the father\u2019s occupation and Duncan Index, where it was showed if they made the average or less than the score for their job, they were placed into the low-social status category. Schooling had a big impact on the earnings the person made, which was lower in the black low-social status community where they began to be discriminated. Work experience was another impact on the individuals earnings, where blacks again were at a loss because they tend to have less work experience than their white competitors. The discrimination shines through when it was shown that low-social status blacks made $1,159 less than the low-social status whites on average. This shows that people of color with the same credentials as whites still make less money, based on their skin color. If discrimination was eliminated, black earnings could boost over twenty-five percent (Jud and Walker). The study explained above highlights the idea that racial discrimination is still a very real thing and that it can determine the amount of money someone gets paid for the same job as someone that is white in the same social class. If an individual is hard-working and gets their job done correctly, there should be no reason some make more than others. Discrimination in the workplace could easily be eliminated and it would allow for equality between races. \n\tWhen employers are looking for job applicants, they tend to stray away from inner-city blacks, whether or not they have the correct credentials for the job and look for white neighborhoods. Inner cities tend to have a bad reputation, being seen as a place of widespread poverty, drug use, crime, etc. but not every person who lives in these areas represents that stereotype. Employers may see a person is from a bad area and assume they will be a poor worker or will act out in an inappropriate way, while this is not always the case, but if it was true, it could be because of the lack of work experience the individuals have due to the discrimination they face day-to-day. In a study done by Neckerman and Kirschnman, they observed interviews conducted on Chicago employers and the tactics they use in their interviewing processes. They focused on three areas while looking into the employer\u2019s strategies: selective recruitment, job interviews, and employment tests. Selective recruitment is the idea of looking for certain types of people that meet their standards and could be based on \u201cstatistical discrimination\u201d or race to predict the characteristics of the person they would be interviewing. Due to this process of selective recruitment, black and Hispanic applicants tend to have less of a chance, based on the bias that is present in today\u2019s world that they may not be a good worker. Social class and where someone resides may also impact their chance of getting a job, because those who live in low-income areas have a bad reputation, whether or not they live up to that reputation. Job interviews conducted by a white male on a black male tend to be more prejudiced based on the fact they may not have much in common and race plays a role in the characteristics a person might have. Social cues and mannerisms impact a job interview as well, such as looking at a person\u2019s posture, eye contact, or voice articulation. Black applicants tended to score lower on that scare, partly due to the difference in education or experience they have had. Prejudice and discrimination are seen amongst different races because they may not have been through similar experiences that they can comfortably have a conversation about, so in a job interview this makes it difficult to have an easy-flowing time. Employment tests are meant to test a job applicant on the skills and criteria of the specific job they are applying for, but that is not always the case. Some employers have outside-the-box questions that may not be obvious to someone with less experience or education, which makes it unfair. A skill test would allow everyone to have the same chance at the job since every individual is capable to complete the same tasks. Not all employers implicate employment tests and rely on selective recruitment or the job interview, which again discriminates racially due to the fact people of color are already at a disadvantage. The study found that most employers did selectively recruit by projecting their interviews in big neighborhoods outside of inner cities. They expected low-income blacks would be poor employees and instead of trying out an interview, they looked elsewhere for applicants. The stereotype that is held over a certain race plays a big role in their chance of getting employed, which is not fair due to the fact not every person is the same. A respondent of the study stated, \u201cThe blacks that are employed are just not as good, not that there aren\u2019t good blacks, but it\u2019s a smaller percent than it would be of whites, for whatever reasons, cultural things, or family background, whatever\u201d, highlighting the argument that because of a person\u2019s skin color and background, they have a smaller chance of getting employed compared to their white competitors (Neckerman and Kirschnman). The respondents comment hints on the topic of cultural and family backgrounds and how that plays into a person\u2019s opportunities. Those who come from a \u201crougher\u201d background are given less opportunities to show their worth because they are discriminated against from a young age. Just because someone comes from a broken home does not mean they will create one, in a lot of cases it motivates the person to do good in the world and strive for greatness. Job interviewers and employers tend to look over that and look purely based on their backgrounds. Another thing that employers look for is job experience and because of that, many blacks do not stand a chance due to their lack of opportunities to find work experience.\n\tA black job applicant has a harder time getting hired than their white job applicant competitors due to the low confidence level many employers have in their race. Stewart and Perlow explore the idea of racial discrimination within the workplace and show how unfair it really is to people of color. \nCertain jobs have more employees of a certain race, so it makes it difficult for others to get hired. If a black male applied for a job that is typically ran by whites, they get turned down more often than not. Evaluator\u2019s attitudes towards blacks tend to be fogged by the stereotypes that come along with the race, meaning they may rate their qualifications lower than those of a white person purely based on the reputation their race holds in society (Stewart and Perlow). Going back on an idea from earlier, those with the same qualifications may be seen and scored differently based on the color of their skin. Just because someone is a race that has a bad reputation in society does not mean they live up to that name, and many employers do not take the time to truly investigate that. The disadvantages that come with the hiring process for a person of color impacts their future greatly, because if they cannot get a job, they will not gain the experience they need to move forward in a career. Some people may fall under the impression that blacks are lazy, not intelligent, or commit crimes due to the stereotype that is place upon them. Every person has the option to be a hard worker and be positive in the workplace, so why should their race stop them from that opportunity? \n\tSeeing things from a different perspective, McIntosh expresses that white privilege is a thing, and it is extremely common for people to overlook. White people on a daily basis decide to ignore the privilege they truly hold over people of color. She explains the certain conditions she lives under as a white woman and how her African American co-workers and friends do not get the same privileges. Some of the things she listed were not having to worry about where she moves to and that she will get along with her neighbors, she is able to go shopping without the assumption she is stealing or committing a crime, she does not have to worry about what will happen if she is pulled over by a cop, and she is able to apply for a job and be confident that she will be hired. Many of these things are taken for granted by the white race, because it may seem like a very normal thing to them, but to those of a different race they have to fear things will go negatively purely based off of the color of their skin. It has been seen in the news recently about an unarmed person of color being pulled over by a cop and it ends in a fatality because the officer was in fear they were in harm\u2019s way, when in reality, they were not. This stereotype placed on the race not only has made it harder for them to succeed and get a career, but it has put their lives in danger. The writing done by McIntosh highlights all of the little things white people take for granted every day that blacks wish they did not have to deal with. It is extremely unfair for someone to be at a disadvantage in many aspects of their life just because of the color of their skin and their background. \n\tDo you now realize how lucky may be to be given the opportunity to start a career? Racial bias in the work industry and employment process puts large groups at a disadvantage, whether they are extremely qualified or not. Employers should eliminate this bias and give every applicant an equal chance at a job if they are just as qualified as their competitors. The elimination of racial bias in employment would allow for so many more people to get jobs and create a future for themselves and their loved ones. White privilege is extremely apparent in today\u2019s world while everyone should be seen as equals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nJud, G. D., & Walker, J. L. (1977).

        "text": "7492\nSOC 105\n1 May 2023\nHow Beauty Standards Are Killing Women from Within\n\tHave you ever found yourself envying an attractive actress? It\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about, it is a common emotion when faced with popular actresses who are stunningly beautiful and live these glamorous lives. However, I guarantee I can describe the character\u2019s general appearance. She probably had flawless skin, a flat stomach, large breasts, and a small waist that tapers out into a larger buttock region, yet her legs are thin enough to leave a gap between her thighs. Was I close? Predicting to physical features of a common actress or celebrity is not as difficult as you think in the age that we live in. In a time that is supposedly accepting of all people no matter their size, shape, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other factor that makes them unique among others, there remains an underlying standard for women\u2019s beauty that becomes increasingly more complex as the world of social media expands. Society claims to be increasingly concerned with the health of our bodies yet continues to objectify and judge women based on their physical features, which leads to all kinds of health issues including depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders. \n\tThe topic of beauty standards and mental health is not a new topic to society, but rather one that has become increasingly more popular as our society transitions into the era of \u201cPostmodern Beauty.\u201d This new era is incredibly detrimental to the development of the personality, self-image, and overall mental of women of all ages. As a woman myself, I have seen and experienced firsthand these starling effects and I am frustrated at the fact that I have no choice but to mature in a culture that is based on uniformity. As children, we see each other as equals, with no real awareness of the shape and size of our bodies. We are fascinated with what the world has to offer and see our bodies as the simple vessels for life that they are. However, at some point, a switch is flipped, and you recognize that the orientation in which you present yourself is subject to the judgment of everyone around you. Some individuals gain great confidence or simply remain ignorant in acknowledging the judgment. For others, this is an all-consuming force that slowly chips away at their self-esteem and can cause catastrophic changes in their lives. \n\tAs a child growing up in rural Pennsylvania, I had little knowledge of social media and therefore was not aware of the standards to which I was supposed to conform to, however, I failed to recognize the nonelectronic influences around me. My parents did a wonderful job at raising my siblings and I to appreciate ourselves, nature, and all the experiences we had been blessed with. Although we protested for phones and other electronics our friends boasted about at school, they remained firm in shielding us from the inevitable detriment of these technologies. However, they could not hold off forever, so when each of us started our freshman year we got phones. I thought I was finally going to be able to make friends and be cool, popular, and all of the things that a 13-year-old valued. But I quickly found out that being close friends with my sibling and the way I dressed was \u201cnot cool\u201d and my body measurements were considered \u201cobese.\u201d My spark of hope died out quickly as I listened more closely to the comments my \u201cfriends\u201d made about my clothes, my personality, the way I spoke, my acne, and above all my body. Comments I had previously dismissed as jokes as I was oblivious to the harsh truth that being unique and experiencing normal bodily changes were ridiculed. \nIn my first 2 months as a Freshman, I found my group of friends no longer talking to me, excluding me from group activities, and pictures, and making crude comments about my appearance behind my back. I began to regress from my social and outgoing nature. I threw myself into school and sports and became infatuated with social media and what was acceptable. I stopped eating breakfast and what little food I ate for lunch I ate alone in my English teacher\u2019s classroom to avoid judgment. I became consumed with the looks I got in the hallways and overanalyzed every conversation I had throughout my day trying to figure out if I looked how they wanted me to. By the beginning of my sophomore year, I had lost almost fifty pounds and I was constantly tired and hungry. People commended me for my weight loss, but it still wasn\u2019t enough to get back the friendships I had lost. Then the pandemic hit. Suddenly no one saw me every day, I couldn\u2019t bury my thoughts in school or athletics because everything was shut down. I was left alone with my thoughts, social media, and most importantly my family. In such a constructive environment I began to dig myself out of the hole of my negative self-image and pulled away from the harsh environment of social media. I gained back some of my weight in muscle and became more comfortable being alone with myself and accepting my uniqueness. \nSociety is structured with the fa\u00e7ade of encouraging each and everyone to be different yet is only truly accepting of those who fit the mold of \u201cperfection.\u201d Although I was able to heal from such a dark time in my life I still deal with constant anxiety and self-esteem issues that will never really go away as long as I live presently in our society. I have seen this need to conform in many other women in my life as well. I have spoken to peers who have spent hundreds of dollars on lip fillers at 17 years old and more recently a friend expressed her excitement as her breast enhancement surgery was just scheduled for the upcoming month, she is only nineteen. Women are constantly striving to attain the perfect body encouraged by multiple factors in American society from influencers such as the Kardashians to weight loss supplement advertisements to the simple plastic doll known as Barbie. These \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d bodies are riddled with unrealistic measurements and the expectation that women have thin limbs and a flat stomach while also sporting curves in \u201call the right places\u201d and large buttocks and breasts. Genetically this is nearly impossible and results in continued dissatisfaction in your own skin. Sometimes the need to fit in can become so powerful it prompts women to take drastic measures such as surgeries or diets that often end in eating disorders, worsened body dysmorphia, and festering mental health issues. \nI am drawn to the complexity of this topic, not only from personal experience and the fear of raising children in such a harsh society but also from the elaborate take Naomi Wolf presents in her piece \u201cThe Beauty Myth.\u201d Wolf defines the beauty myth itself as a commodified, censored, and unreachable physical ideal to which women must adhere. In other words, it is the idea that women should present themselves in a beautiful way while men should always have access to these beautiful women. This myth functions as a means of controlling the actions and appearances of women and keeping them under the control of society. It is a despicable idea rooted in the ideas of eating disorders, inferiority, and domestic violence, each of which is incredibly toxic in the grand scheme of how women see themselves. While Wolf claims the myth of beauty is an order that dictates behavior rather than appearances, it is clear that the behavior provoked produces actions contributing to the beautification or enhancement of the appearance of the affected individual. An example of this myth in effect was seen after the Industrial Revolution. As women began to emerge from their stationary place in the home they infiltrated secondary education, legal rights, the circle of trade, and the liberal professions. Men sought a means to weaken them and given that they already gained physical control of themselves they imposed beauty standards to weaken them mentally, contracting the rise of feminism. While this was imposed by all of society, it was pushed heavily by males in order for them to remain in prominent positions and keep women complacent in their servitude to men. In our modern age, the beauty myth has shifted substantially in the sense of what is its main source of power and momentum.\n\tAs Wolf outlined in her piece men played the largest role in imposing this idea of strict beauty standards on women, motivated by remaining in power above them. However, I believe in the 21st century men are not responsible for the mass imposition of standards on women. It is the collective effort of both men and women to oppress other women. Men still strive to stay ahead of women as per the age-old tale of gender supremacy. The complexity comes when you consider how women oppress each other. If you think about it, which gender is inherently obsessed with the action of gossiping, a process of speaking poorly about someone based on a judgment they have made? When women discuss other women more often than not, they are critiquing the way the woman at hand has presented herself to society, referring implicitly to her physical features. Women partake in the breaking down of one another for the same reason men do, to gain more power over the oppressed, and do so through many means from physical speech to social media to pushing diet culture through society. This makes it increasingly harder for women to escape this maltreatment as it approaches them from all angles, attesting to the chain reaction of anxiety depression, body dysmorphia, and eventually eating disorders that lead to larger medical issues. Somehow society has taken the nontangible idea of \u201cbeauty\u201d and invested so much, attention, time, energy, and resources into it allowing it to manifest and effectively kill these women from the inside out through their own behaviors and call it \u201chealthy.\u201d  Men and women will always have an underlying imbalance in power, but it would be to unsensible the imbalance women create within their own gender group. \n\tUpon reevaluating Wolf\u2019s idea of \u201cbeauty myth\u201d I am prompted to reflect on my time in high school. My \u201cfriends\u201d gossiped about my clothes, my skin, and my weight for the purpose of putting themselves ahead of me socially and ensuring that I would not be able to infiltrate their group, all of whom fit the mold of the \u201cBarbie Doll\u201d figure. I altered the way I acted by restricting my eating to change my appearance in an attempt to win over their approval. I recognize now that men had nothing to do will the change in my behavior, they were solely provoked by the insecurity of other women fighting for their own spots in the small social environment of our high school. A simple change in the environment I spent my time in daily shifted my outlook on my body and image, reinforcing the idea that without the presence of societal pressure from others the beauty myth is nonexistent, or has no power over an individual. If we are really looking for someone to blame, we should blame ourselves because even those oppressed are guilty of oppressing others. Wolf does an excellent job outlining this fact throughout the rise of feminism to the 21st century, requiring only the elaboration of the reader\u2019s own place in society to recognize this malicious pattern. \nOur society is extremely contradictory in expressing and acting on their values. We claim to be increasingly concerned with the health of our bodies yet continues to objectify and judge women based on their physical features, which leads to all kinds of health issues including depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders. We produce diets, advertisements, influencers, and even toys that project the need for an unrealistic body type to truly be \u201cbeautiful\u201d in American society. This means, for women, there is no true escape from these detrimental standards. I would like to end on a positive note of hope for a future free of oppressive standards but in honesty, there does not seem to be a way to shift a pattern of oppression that spans thousands of years and continues to reproduce itself in new ways as technology continues to advance. Peace and equality among gender would be ideal yet unrealistic, however, peace and support among women could go a long way in helping to ease the impact of this oppression, allowing for the cultivation of body positivity and positive self-esteem among all women. \nWorks Cited\nWolf, Naomi.

        "text": "Carly Meier\nSociology 105\n29 November 2021\nShaping Our Future \nAt first appearance Harari has a multitude of social theories on anything from warfare, religion, and education to ignorance, science fiction, and fake news; however, the crux of each of Harari\u2019s discussions are data: big data, artificial intelligence, and its owners. Harari proposes that our future in social organization and strategic action will be based upon data, artificial intelligence (AI), and society\u2019s reaction to AI. These reactions will shape our future.\nIn accordance with Harari, technology, big data, and AI are the driving forces of the future, which will not only shape industries and international trade, but humanity and global society. We must look to a future based on big data and AI and plan for it now. As AI matures, jobs once held by humans will transition to AI. As AI matures and algorithms become more complex, jobs once considered as irreplaceable, such as attorneys will be taken over by AI. The role of humans in the workforce will shift to that of maintenance of the data and AI. \nHarari suggests that in response to the continued maturation and development of sophisticated AI and its increasing prevalence throughout all arenas of society, AI has the potential to establish a new class system of humans, which he calls \u201csuperhumans\u201d. Superhumans are those individuals possessing technical skills, giving them the capability to manage AI and big data. Harari professes that these superhumans will be the leaders of the world, set apart from the rest of society due to their due to their exceptional technological savvy.\n\tAs AI develops Harari proposes that it will soon develop human creativity and emotion. This will continue to drive humans from jobs. Harari seems to pose this as positive; I am still looking for the positive in this scenario. With AIs advancement comes the geographic fallout as well as the large technically savvy countries will bankrupt the small struggling nations.\n\tHarari turns to technology and its impacts on truth, personal finance, and fake news by the use of technologically created algorithms. Algorithms determine the order data appears during each Google search. The ability to control algorithms allows superhumans to control what we research and ultimately think and purchase. As such, these algorithms will dictate the responses to your Google searches, your loans, and you will assist in the ease of getting your daily fill of the internet\u2019s fake news.  \n\tIn accordance with Harari, what our schools are teaching today will be insignificant in the future. Students are taught volumes of data from historical events and dates, to current events. Why, we are just teaching our students data, which is easily accessible from anywhere. Harari goes on that these children need to be taught critical thinking skills, how to communicate and collaborate; the data is there for them to find; there is no need to memorize it. The children of the future need to learn how to work with the data through critical thinking and analyzation. Again, it is those that have learned the technological skills and are savvy that will be leaders of the future.\n\tNeil Fligstein and Doug McAdam discussions are more of the social movements and how social movements are started and their changes on society than the use of technology for the future. Fligstein and McAdam focus on what creates and drives a social movement and elicits strategic changes. They have conducted research and studied how \u201cactors\u201d who were relatively powerless were able to take action and lead a social movement. Where Harari focuses on changes through AI and data, Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam continue to look to social movements and their abilities to shape the future. \nThe key components to Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam\u2019s theory are through strategic action fields (SAFs) which include incumbents/challengers/governance units. Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam consider SAFs as the field on which the actor\u2019s function within society for social reform and change.  This field is where they function in unison in accordance with the field rules.\n\tNeil Fligstein and Doug McAdam\u2019s theory on social organization and strategic action is based on the relationship of members of each strategic field and the interconnection of fields. Fligstein and McAdam\u2019s propose that these fields are made up of members which continually vie for position and increasing reputation and power. There are numerous interconnected, overlapping, and often interdependent fields which contain actors that move on and off these field making moves for ownership of power. All the actors are continuously making moves on field to adjust their position and impact the actions of the other actors. Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam believe that each field includes both incumbents and challengers. Incumbents who have been on the field for quite some time and challengers who have less authority and are vying for higher status. Most fields also have a form of oversight or governance which is used to ensure that rules are followed throughout the field. It is the entire group, the actors, governance, challengers, and incumbents that make up the each SAFs.  \nNeil Fligstein and Doug McAdam consider that social organization and strategic change may take place in part due to the back-and-forth churn for power within the SAFs. Moreover, Fligstein and  McAdam do not consider that one or a small handful of superhumans hold the knowledge, but that the intelligence of the SAFs is obtained through the collective knowledge of the SAFs. The power of each SAF is created and momentum of each SAF is attained through the churn that takes place and the interactions within the SAF. As such, the skills are a collective of the highly developed group knowledge rather than that of an individual actor. \nAs noted in detail above, Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam\u2019s see social movements and change dictated through an elaborate system of strategic action fields (SAFs). These SAFs are a highly sophisticated hierarchical group that collectively possesses the knowledge and power to both initiative and action social change. On the other hand, Harari, sees the power of the future of our society in the hands of a smaller subgroup, the superhumans. Harari, sees not a collective, but a more highly specialized smaller group of individuals, the superhumans which possesses the required savvy to manage the worlds technological advances.\nHarari focuses on the future being driven by big data, who understands it, who can manage it, and most importantly who owns it. Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam do not make mention of big data. Harari continues to discuss the development of and advancements within artificial intelligence (AI) and its impacts to our future. Harari notes the impacts to education, career, creativity, and many other aspects f our society. Again, Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam do not make mention of the impacts of AI. \nNeil Fligstein and Doug McAdam are focusing on the social movements and changes of the past, how they were orchestrated and their ideals of the collective SAF conscience. They are less interested in predicting the future itself, but in predicting the functionality of the way in which society responds and shapes the future. \nHarari takes a focus on where we are today based on the past and given that rate of development where will we be in the future and what does that mean for us. He takes a the past and the present and projects it upon the future. \nNeil Fligstein and Doug McAdam do not appear to look forward as much as to the past. Harari takes the growth in data, technology, and AI, and projects what the impacts may be in the future. Knowing the rapid speed that technology has already changed the world Harari touches on what that may look like in many of the aspects of society. He addresses what our changes will be in the workforce, education, warfare, creativity, and even our religion. Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam stay focused on the way changes will take place choosing not to discuss the changes they see coming or the impacts these changes may have on the future of society. Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam simply remain focused on the structure of how the changes may be initiated. Harari takes his theories and projects them into the future.

Why do I have so many facades and appearances? Why do I act in such opposing ways when around friends, strangers, teachers, and parents? I present myself to different people differently in any given situation. Why do we all choose to be a different character around these different groups of people and in various settings? \n\t\u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage,\u201d according to Shakespeare and that\u2019s so true. It is understandable why it is so difficult to get to know who people truly are and why they act the way they do. This is because we are all actors and life is our stage. In the application of \u201cPresentation of Self,\u201d a person is an actor / actress and their \u201cact\u201d is dependent on the situation and who is present.  We project the image that we want based on the specific setting. What we project is the image of ourselves that we want others to see. It may or may not be part of our \u201ctrue\u201d self. Our friends, family, teachers, anyone we meet are constantly looking and judging to see who we really are.  Who is the \u201ctrue\u201d Carly?\n\tOur roles are an important part of how we act. We have various roles as we go through each day. We have roles that are ascribed, these are roles that were chosen for us, such as daughter, female, Hispanic, adopted. Then we have roles that we have choses such as student and hopefully nurse. It is through the performance we give that we express ourselves within each of these roles. This plays a large part in our behaviors and interactions throughout the day. I do not act the same in the role as daughter as I do in the role as friend, acquaintance, or student.\n\tIn front of my parents, I play the role of daughter. It is in the role that I am most likely my \u201ctrue self\u201d. This may be the one role that is at this time in my life, this easiest role to play. They are the only people that love me unconditionally. As such, I am not inclined to need to search for the appropriate character, the role comes naturally. I feel very comfortable, so I am able to just be myself. In front of them the performance is very limited. Would everyone agree that I\u2019m being one hundred percent myself? Probably not. They would probably assume that I act a certain way to please my parents. To some extent they are correct. I won\u2019t talk to them like I would talk to my friends, because there is a certain amount of respect that you owe to your parents. Other than the way I talk to them, I would say I am myself in front of them. Since I have been in front of them and have known them since before I could really \u201cperform\u201d one could argue that I am not performing. At an early age I learned that if I misbehaved in front of my parents, there would be trouble. Things were much better for me if I just waited until they turned their heads. It was at that early age that we were already beginning to learn how to \u201cact\u201d in front of our parents. The daughter role is the easiest of my roles.  \n\tFor the years of my high school I had been basically living \u201cre-runs\u201d or syndicated television shows or living in the movie \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d when it comes to the roles I need to play. I was living with my parents and my sister and going to the same the school. So I played the roles of daughter, sister, close friend, not-so-close friend, and student on a daily basis. So, for those four years of high school, and most likely the three years of middle school as well, I did not have the need to make that many adjustments to the \u201cacts\u201d. It was a comfortable time. Now and then a new friend or situation would show up, but for the most part, things remained relatively constant. Thing took a dramatic shift when it was time to hit the road to Wilmington, NC. I had several \u201cdiscussions\u201d with my new roommate over Snapchat before it was move in day for college. Over the internet is hard to determine how you need to act, what character you need to play. As I moved my stuff into my room, my parents were with me, along with my roommate and her mom. Who was I to be? On one hand, I was Carly, the daughter; and on the other, I was not sure who I was because Snapchat was not very helpful. Now this is every actor / actress\u2019s nightmare, it is like forgetting your lines. My problem was, I had no lines. I had no directions on who I needed to be. \n\tNow, turn your attention to center stage, things take a sharp turn. I was walking to one of my first days of college classes. One of my friends in our group had just told a crazy story about something that happened to her in her senior year of high school. As we were all laughing hysterically, I reached the place that is to be the spot for my class. I am entering the stage playing the role of a classmate. Suddenly, my back was little bit straighter, and I ran my fingers through my hair. Quietly I entered the building and found my classroom. I opened the door as gently as possible to ensure no one heard me so they would not turn around. I slipped into my seat and opened my bookbag and pulled out my laptop, ready for class. I sat quietly waiting on my professor. During class, I tried not to make eye contact with the professor. When in class I am a student and that is my role. As such, my character is quiet, and my demeaner studious. I am meeting the expectations of the teachers. This drives much of my behavior. They have the expectations that students are here to learn, and that education is first on their list. Teachers tend to keep personalities out of their evaluation of students. As such, with my teachers, I remain quiet and scholarly, blending into the crowd.\n\tThe role of close friend is harder for me. I act differently given each of the friends. I think this is when different sociological concepts come into play as well. I think that in front of each one I act differently because of how I originally presented myself. When I met each of them for the first time, I was at a different stage in life, so I acted differently in front of each of them. The type of performance they put on when I first met them also influenced how I acted. My one good friend I met in sixth grade, at this point in my life, I was still unsure about who I really was so my performance conveyed someone who was colder and more closed off because I didn\u2019t want to be judged. Her performance at the time was similar, so we got along and never had any cases of mistaken identity. My other good friend I met junior year of high school, by this time I was more comfortable with who I was and was able to be more myself when meeting her. Our dynamics are different, but they both work because we know our roles and how to perform in front of each other.  \n\tWhen meeting new people I am definitely perceived as quiet and probably shy. With new people I am unsure of the role I am supposed to play, so until I watch them for a while and get a feel of their part. Once I get to know them and we become friends I become more open and my performance changes. With my newer friends, they perceive me as an easy going and funny person and for the most part accept me. However, I also know that there is a risk of falling out of acceptance. As such, with my friends, I am able to be funny, but because there is always that chance of additional judgement, I stay sarcastic; it keeps me in control. I am also nicer because that level of comfortable enough to jokingly be mean hasn\u2019t been reached yet. There are always the possibilities of roles getting changed though. \n\tWith my parents, they love me and want the best for me. They don\u2019t judge me and have unconditional love for me, but they perform in front of me, they aren\u2019t their true selves because they have the role of being in charge. My parents keep me on my toes and hold me accountable for what I say and do. Without this performance though, there would be an imbalance in the relationship. \n\tOn social media it\u2019s an entirely different story. Only the good parts of life are really shared on social media, I think people use it as a little bit of an escape. They like to look at the pretty things in life. This however is toxic because there is no immediate physical presence of anybody and people aren\u2019t really invested in what\u2019s happening with you. \nEverybody has a different role they play in different situations and these roles only work if the performers are able to recognize the different roles. For example, in a group of close friends I am sarcastic, at home I am talkative and goofy, and yet to my teachers quiet and diligent. This is due to my \u201cpresentation of self,\u201d this is the idea that in the immediate presence of others, people put on a performance. How do you know who someone really is, when all you can do is examine appearance and current \u201crole performance\u201d?  In each setting you could find yourself putting on a different performance, being \u201ca different person\u201d.\nWhen you are alone and when no one is around, the stage is gone. It is at this time that you jump off the stage. You can remove all the facades that you have had to carry around throughout the day. It is at that time that you take a deep breath and realize that you are you. Are you funny? Yes. Are you sarcastic? Yes. Are you goofy? Yes. Are you quite? Yes. Are you diligent in your studies? Yes. Are you shy? Yes. Are you an actress? Yes. You become all of those things. So, are you truly acting? Maybe, but these are all parts of what make up you. They are pieces of who you are when you are with others and in other situations. \n\t",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n29 November 2021\nThe Role Religion Plays in Today\u2019s Society\n\tReligion has been at the roots of society since human civilization was formed. Overtime religion has grown and transformed dramatically. There are estimated to be about 10,000 religions practiced worldwide. The most practiced religions are Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Religion has allowed for many people to form a community within their society. Emil Durkheim explains in his piece \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations\u201d that religion was a crucial part of the formation of society and aided in the creation of the collective consciousness. Yuval Noah Harari touches on the function of religion in today\u2019s society in his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. Harari highlights how religion does not play as much of an influential role in today\u2019s society because of the great advancement made by the human race through technology and complex thinking. Although Durkheim and Harari have differing views on the role of religion, both sociologist\u2019s points are pertinent. Durkheim\u2019s beliefs are more relevant to the beginnings of society, while Harari\u2019s beliefs are more relevant to today\u2019s society. Religion was crucial in the formation of society, but it has now become more obsolete and not necessary for societies to operate.\n\tEmil Durkheim brought forth the idea of the collective consciousness to sociology. The collective consciousness can be defined as a set of shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes that unify a society. It defines what is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d in a society as well as the kind of morality an individual must exude in the society. This shared belief is necessary to maintain moral order. Without it, society would not exist since everyone would have different ideas of how society was supposed to function. For example, one person could believe that hurting another person for personal gain is perfectly fine, while another could believe that hurting another person in any aspect is very wrong. Without a consensus and agreement between the people, everyone would have different moral codes leading to major conflict and a community would be unable to form. Collective consciousness forms by humans interacting with each other in some pattern. The religious rituals that were performed by early civilization \u2013 which is a coordinated sequence of events that relate to a higher power \u2013 brought the community together because they were coming together for a common purpose. This common purpose could be a range of things whether it be to have good crops in the next season or to grant good health among all of the people in the community. Participating in these rituals facilitated communication and social gathering. These rituals allowed for collective life to become tangible which aided in the development of the collective consciousness. Durkheim argues that when the collective life reaches an adequate amount of intensity, religious life is the direct consequence. Since religion plays such a critical role in the development of the collective consciousness, Durkheim also argues that the fundamental categories of thought, science, and social institutions have religious roots.\n\tYuval Noah Harari has quite a different take on the role of religion in society. Harari\u2019s book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century focuses much more on religion in today\u2019s world unlike Durkheim\u2019s piece which focuses more on the birth of society. Harari argues the fact that religion has become less relevant to society\u2019s function since human\u2019s have advanced so much. Today\u2019s society has integrated so much technology and science into people\u2019s lives. With this advancement, people are exposed to much more information and scientifically supported explanations for things that may have previously only been explained by religion. With access to this information, people have the option to believe in the new discoveries or in the religious explanation. They are not limited to having to blindly believe in what religion says because it is the only explanation that society has been able to come up with. For example, religion used to tell people that sacrifices were the only way to have a good rain season and a good harvest, but now society has discovered the science needed to keep crops alive so that sacrifices are deemed unnecessary. Also, as the human race has grown, more religions have been born with different beliefs. These religions help bring together regions of people but having different religious beliefs has also led to many conflicts in the modern day. According to Harari, the entire human race is the society and having many religions does not help unify the community, but often polarizes people. Harari also refers to categories of issues that the world faces today including a technical aspect and a policy aspect. The technical aspect refers to the way things are done in the world and the policy aspect refers to how governments create policy to address problems in the world. Harari uses the example that if Egypt was struck by a plague of locusts, they could pray to Allah, but they would also call upon scientists to develop stronger pesticides and insect resisting wheat strains. In this situation, religion can play a role in the solution but modern-day solutions through science are also utilized. Harari also uses an example where he states that if a crucial decision needs to be made about the Iranian government, they turn to the modern scientists of economics to get answers because the 7th century Arabs did not have knowledge about modern economics that they could\u2019ve put in the Quran. After coming to a solution using the ideas of Karl Marx, Milton Freidman, and Fredrich Hayek, they would also use a Quranic verse to support the economic decision. Here, Harari is trying to point out that religion is no longer the best or only way to make decisions since there are other resources for people to utilize. \nDurkheim and Harari have different views on the importance of religion in our society, but both sociologists have convincing points for their arguments. Durkheim believes that religion is what founded society and allowed for people to come together and form the collective consciousness. He argues that a society would not be possible without religion. On the complete other end of the spectrum, Harari believes that religion is not necessary for our society to function. Since the world has made such advancements in science and critical thinking, religion is not the only thing governing how or what people think. Despite the fact that both of these arguments are very different, they are both still valid and they can also be tied together. Religion was necessary for society to be born because it brought people together and allowed for them to form a collective consciousness. Without this collective consciousness, people would not be able to live in harmony together or have universal standard morals. Early civilizations used religion as a way to explain things that they could not explain on their own. They also used religion as a comfort for the unknown. Many fear the uncertainty and unknowingness of death, but the belief of going to heaven puts them at ease and makes it less scary. This is still present in today\u2019s world. Science and technology have not been able to figure out what happens to one\u2019s soul once they die, so religion is used as a way to explain it. Although, science and technology have been able to provide evidence for other instances where religion was used to explain the unknown. In today\u2019s society, technological advancement has allowed for more information to be discovered. When new information is discovered, it disproves previous beliefs, like those that are embedded within religion. As new ideas are brought into the world and challenges religion, it also can create conflict. The same can occur between different religions who have different beliefs. Religion in today\u2019s world can definitely bring forth conflicts, but it can also bring a sense of community and identity to people. Interacting with people who believe in the same things you do, helps solidify and reassure your ideas and gives you a community of people that you can turn to. Harari and Durkheim both touch on this topic. Durkheim\u2019s views reflect how religion effected society when it was created, but Harari\u2019s views reflect how religion does not affect society nearly as much in today\u2019s society. \nReligion has majorly influenced our society in the way that it functions and the understood universal moral code. According to Durkheim, religion allowed people to come together because of a common belief which then resulted in the formation of the collective consciousness. With the formation of the collective consciousness, a society had the ability to form. As society has advanced through science, technology, and more complex thoughts and ideas, the role of religion has shifted. According to Harari, religion does not play as critical of a role in the function of society because people can rely on science and technology to give them explanations for things instead of religion. Religion can still be used today as something that someone can identify and feel a sense of community, but religion is not necessary for the functionality of society today. ",

In Peggy McIntosh\u2019s\u2019 article, \u201cwhite Privilege\u201d, she takes a step back to realize from a young age most Caucasian children socially learned and adapted to the mindset that \u201cracism as something which puts others at a disadvantage\u201d, not noticing that white Americans were the ones who needed to realize they are at an advantage. Emile Durkheim defines the \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d as a set of shared beliefs, ideas, and morals and also says that individuals have the same morality to fit in. The collective consciousness that appears here is the shared idea that white people are not the thing that needs to be fixed, it is that African Americans need to be fixed(helped). Since this is set in our minds, we are oblivious to the things Caucasian people do regularly that black Americans have to worry about. McIntosh debriefs her life as a white person and points out issues she doesn\u2019t have to worry about, like if people think she is financially reliable, or if she moves that her neighbors respect her, or even if she joins a group of sorts she wouldn\u2019t be singled out by her race. \n\n          McIntosh uncovers something I never even thought about but is so looked over and ignored by white Americans. As children grow up it is a social ideal that they need to be more aware of how poorly and unfair African Americans are treated, which is true. But as white people, like me, age in society, they don\u2019t realize that some of the things they do daily, black Americans have to be afraid of judgement, rejection, and the possibility of being harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcIntosh, Peggy.

        "text": "Women as Other on Campus\nThe concept of \u201cwomen as other\u201d or \u201csecond gender\u201d is something that has caught a lot of attention and more people are recognizing that it has been around for centuries and needs to change. Although it is still present on campus at UNCW, it is different than what I have experienced before. Because the majority of the student population is girls, there is a somewhat different dynamic on campus because it is not what we are used to seeing in the work place, or even in other educational places.\n\u201cWomen as other\u201d is a concept that has been getting more attention recently, but some people still do not understand what it is, or why it is a problem. Otherizing women is essentially putting them into a box, or certain roles (wife, mother, daughter) and not allowing them to create their own identity. Men are assigning the roles to women in their life and teaching them what they are supposed to doing. The women are not allowed to do or be anything outside of what the man assigns her to. This has been going on for ages, and it is very hard to pinpoint a time of when exactly it started. A woman becomes \u201cother\u201d when she submits to the males idea of the worlds, and accepts the world from their point of view. When the women gives up on trying to get the male to see the world from her perspective. She will become the other easily because it is what the rest of the world expects to happen, and the male is expected to be dominate, thus she gives into him, and the rest of society. Not only does this create issues with what women believe they are capable of doing, it also permanently places women on the outside, and makes them the \u201cother\u201d. Because they are being defined by men, they are becoming what is called the \u201csecond gender\u201d.\nThe concept of \u201csecond gender\u201d is very similar to otherizing, but it puts women in a lower place on the social totem pole than men. At one point in time, women were seen as the defective human, or the incomplete man. These thoughts lead to people thinking, and agreeing with the idea that being a man was virtue, and that women were inherently wrong. Once this idea was accepted by society, it made it very hard for women to create their own self or be something outside of a relationship with a man. It also led to the idea that women were trapped in their own body, and only making emotional decisions, thus they were not allowed to make important decisions that men were expected to make. \nWomen have been experiencing these issues for an extended period of time, and it has come to the point where it is almost expected for them to feel as if men are looking down on them. In the work place, educational spaces, and just normal everyday areas women are subjected to these views constantly. Women being treated differently in the workplace can be easily explained by the idea that women are nurses and men are the \u201creal\u201d doctors. The women are stereotyped into having a lesser job, or not being as important. \nThe aforementioned stereotypes are what people grow up learning and experiencing so they accept it and think that it is normal for women to be lesser, or not have an important role in public society. These stereotypes also arise because of the previous lack of women in the workforce. They were the minority and thus treated differently because of that. Now if we look at the campus of UNCW, you can see the juxtaposition between gender ratios in the workplace and on campus. With a gender ratio of almost 70% female and 30% male, there are significantly more females enrolled than males, and this creates a different dynamic that no one is used to being in. Women are now the majority, but men still treat them as the \u201cother\u201d or \u201csecond gender\u201d and still do not allow them to create their own personalities outside of the typical stereotypes. \n\tThe men on campus all see the gender ratio as something good for them, some of the ones that I have talked to think that it makes their life easier. They can be talking to multiple different girls at the same time because there are such fewer males than females on campus. Although they might see it as something beneficial, it really is not. The amount if women on campus creates a lot of tension between all of them because they are all going after the same group of guys. Not only does it create competition, it also creates a lot more comparison. Comparison between women is another thing that has been around for decades, but it arose from stereotypes that have been created for them to fit into; These stereotypes can also be referred to as the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d. The beauty myth gives us the idea that for women, the being beautiful should be the most important thing, and that women\u2019s value is based on only their beauty, and actions that meet the standards created for them. The beauty myth came about as a backlash to feminism. Men wanted to undermine the power that they were gaining and ensure that they would never beat out men. Women are so subjected to it because society has accepted it and plays into it, this can be seen in the entertainment industry, where women are portrayed according to the male gaze. Consumerism and the expansion of media has also influenced this a lot and created a narrower picture that women are expected to meet and it has escalated the problem. \n\tBoth situations, women being the minority or the majority, there are issues that are created and there is no true way to get around them. There is also no way to make sure that everyone is happy with how they are being treated in the workplace, or in an education space and this makes solving the issues that we know are so prevalent and have been around for so long extremely more difficult than previously thought. \n\tAlthough there are things being done to combat these stereotypes and ideas that are been around for centuries, there has been a lot of damage done by them, and they will continue to be practiced and accepted because it has been engrained into society and passed on from one generation to the next. The only way for these ideas and concepts to stop being socially accepted, is to start teaching the next generation about them in a way that will allow them to realize why things like \u201cwomen as other\u201d, \u201csecond gender\u201d, and \u201cthe beauty myth\u201d are harmful to a whole, and start providing resources and help that will allow them to change the ways people are treated. The gender stereotypes that were created by all of these concepts are slowly starting to change, but not enough to make it were there are no more gender expectations. People now have the freedom of expression and open interpretation which allows them to be the person they want to be, not what others expect of them. \n",

Harari has a more modern perspective on our current society and has some very interesting and somewhat radical perspectives. Harari views capitalism as something people follow like a religion. He believes capitalism is reliant on people's belief in it. Harari believes that capitalism is greatly threatened by algorithms and AI and warns us about them. Algorithms collect data and give computers instructions that make them work smarter. The advancement of these computers is frightening because there are no regulations as to how this technology advances. The sci-fi television shows we watch with crazy robots and dystopian societies are becoming less of a fictional topic, and more of something we may see everyday. With the advancements in technology, workers in our capitalist society are becoming threatened, because AI could do the work they do more efficiently, and cheaper. These private companies will gain immense amounts of power, for they will have to pay fewer people, which could result in many people being out of a job. This large amount of power granted to these private companies and their higher up employees is frightening, and unfair. Overall, Harari sees capitalism as something that may be overtaken. \n\n\tWhile both Harari and Marx lived in different time periods, they do have similar views. Harari\u2019s views are more futuristic, whereas Marx\u2019s views are dated due to the fact that he was alive 200 years ago. I would argue and say that regardless of this massive time gap, Marx's opinions and views are universal, considering they are still heavily discussed today. Both of these men see Capitalism as fragile and bound to come to an end. Harari believes that algorithms and AI will bring capitalism to an end. Marx believed that tension amongst the differing socioeconomic classes would cause the end of capitalism, and society would adopt socialism. Both Harari and Marx recognized the unfair treatment of workers in the Capitalist system. Harari discusses how unfair, unequal, and scary the amount of power private companies have truly is. Marx also mentions how unfair this distribution of power is. He also shined light on how these workers work hard, at their employers beck and call, to produce products. Product they will never receive the profit from.  Overall, both of these great thinkers see Capitalism as a flawed system that is bound for failure. \n\t\tKarl Marx and Yuval Noah Harari are both highly respected intellectuals with some radical and mostly prolific ideas.  Marx\u2019s ideas are very controversial and have been for a long time. There is one undeniable truth, and that is that Marx\u2019s ideas are highly influential, important, and timeless. Almost 200 years later and his ideas and theories are still discussed, disputed, and even used today. Harari on the other hand, who is still currently alive, also has very interesting and thought provoking ideas and theories about our society. He does a wonderful job using what we know now as the basis for predictions about how our future will look. Both Harari and Marx share similar views about Capitalism. They both see it as a doomed system that will fail eventually, as well as unfair and cruel to the workers the private companies within the system thrive off of. Marx has his own political ideology, with some followers still to this day. Modern day forms of communism stem from his writings. Harari is not a political theorist, he is a great thinker and philosopher that has used information he has gathered from the world around us to draw conclusions and state observations. After reading and studying the work and ideas of both of these men, I have gained a new perspective on Capitalism as well as the socio-economic class system here in the United States. \n\n\nWorks Cited\n\u201cCapitalism Definition & Meaning.\u201d Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism. \nHarari, Yuval N. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

        "text": "The Looking Glass Self and Me\nI overheard my parents complaining about me to one another, friends, and other family all the time. My siblings and I always joked about how our house had \u201crice paper\u201d walls. Let me tell you, nothing, and I mean nothing is more irritating than hearing your parents talk down about you. Letters came in the mail from schools and programs for troubled youth. I was constantly being punished for one thing or another. I was always to blame for any and everything. The \u201ccommon denominator,\u201d as I previously stated. Anytime me and any of my brothers bickered, my parents would automatically assume I was to blame. At school I was the teacher\u2019s pet. Perfectly behaved. We had citizenship sticker charts and I had the most stickers in my class. I was always on the honor roll and my teachers could not seem to praise me enough. The first \u201cprinciple element\u201d of the Looking Glass Self is the \u201cImagination of our appearance to the other person.\u201d My parents left very little up to imagination. I knew exactly how they viewed me when private conversations were very loudly spoken just a room over (New York Italians do not know how to be quiet). My countless number of nicknames referring to my attitude problem very much reinforced the things I overheard. The many positive reinforcements for my behavior and the special treatment I received from teachers really solidified the idea that they believed I was good. I was viewed as two different children at home and at school. \n\tThe third and final principle is the presentation of yourself for others based on how you believe and imagine someone sees you.  Because I had conflicting views as to how others viewed me, I had two \u2018presentations\u201d so to speak. Based on my parents' negative view, I acted negatively.  I was the problem child. I acted out. I argued, fought, yelled, screamed, and threw fits. I was a terror. Any chance I had to cop an attitude, I did. Nobody needed to provoke me. I was a horrible listener, disrespectful, and mean. My attitude was \u201cif they think that was bad, I\u2019ll show them bad.\u201d Every adult other than my parents thought of me positively. I was the golden child. So, at school, or at a friend's house I was perfect... A good listener, respectful, and well mannered. I was more than happy to lend a helping hand, sometimes without being asked. I had good grades, and never had to be disciplined by my teachers. I was the student teachers put next to the new kid on their first day. My friend\u2019s parents always happily welcomed me into their homes. I am my grandparent\u2019s favorite grandchild. I was truly two different children. Two extremes. My teachers were always baffled to hear that I had an attitude problem at home, whereas my parents were always confused as to why I wasn\u2019t that way at school. Ultimately, I reciprocate the energy I receive, still to this day. \nOverall, the concept of the Looking Glass Self has affected me throughout my childhood, and still affects me to this day. The three core principles of the theory have been clearly demonstrated throughout my life. I was seen as good for some people and bad for others. Consequently, I acted good and bad. The conflicting views of me from my parents against the views of other adults caused me to act in two different ways. It is really hard to have a clear cut view of yourself when there are so many different perceptions. Nowadays, my relationship with my parents has completely changed and I am not ill behaved and a pain anymore. The clearest demonstration of the Looking Glass Self for me and others recently is via social media. There is a clear and pressing urge to impress. You want others to view your life as exciting and intriguing. It is all a facade. \nNobody\u2019s life is perfect. It is truly thought provoking and crazy to think about how we all act in certain ways and base it on others opinions. You are constantly told to just live your life and not care what others think but we are truly a reflection of others opinions whether we want to help it or not. Claiming you don\u2019t care about others opinions is simply untrue. It is inevitable. Throughout my life I have been acting a way in order to appease the opinions and thoughts I assume others have about me. \n\nWorks Cited\nCooley, Charles Horton. \u201cThe Looking-Glass Self.\u201d Social Media & the Self: An Open Reader, 1902, https://doi.org/10.32376/3f8575cb.73d69f51. \n\n\n\n\n",

Previously in society women did not have much choice when it came to what they could do to be beautiful, the men in their life would decide that for them. Throughout history the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d has not been an issue but time has changed and after the industrial war this is an obstacle for many. There are multiple reasons and concepts of how and why \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d exists and its effect on normal women in the United States. In the rest of this essay, I will dig into what those concepts are and how the beauty myth has grown to become more harmful than it has ever been. \n       Naomi defines \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d, as the increase in beauty standards and importance of beauty while at the same time women making progress in equality. Although many women might not like to admit it, a big population wish they were more beautiful. This toxic collective consciousness shared by women is influenced by what is presented by big corporations that want to make women feel the need to be \u201cmore beautiful\u201d and therefore buy things that can help them achieve that. The saddening thing about this is that society pushes this myth even though it is not true in the way that women need to be more \u201cbeautiful\u201d . In fact, this \u201cbeauty myth\u201d is pushed to make women appear weaker and for men and other beneficiaries look more powerful, which will be talked about later.\n              Through the course of American history beauty standards have changed and since the Industrial war has then grown into \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d. Before then, women did not have the constant reminder by technology of what \u201cbeauty\u201d looks like. During this time, in order to find a spouse as a woman you had to have fertility and be willing work in the home and take care of the children. It is evident this standard has since changed for the worse. Because after the industrial war not everyone in the family was expected to work and hold the same important of importance in providing for the family, women became domesticated in the household. Wolf explains that not long after that took place, \u201csince the Industrial Revolution, middle-class Western women have been controlled by ideals and stereotypes as much as by material constraints.\u201d (Wolf, 4) By this time women were exposed to photos and images of what women should want to look like all because of technology. As technology has advanced and is commonly used by people every day this issue of an idolized beauty has gotten worse and encouraged by \u201cmen's institutions and institutional power.\u201d (Wolf, 3)\n          As there has been a push by society for women to engage in beauty, this also came with a huge \u201cbacklash\u201d of a certain level of beauty women feel necessary to attain. Many people agree and believe women should be able to do whatever they want to feel beautiful and actually are encouraged to but even feminists according to the school of psychological sciences proclaim that \u201cintense social pressure to pursue beauty disempowers women\u201d ( Leeat Ramati-Ziber, Nurit Shnabel, Peter Glick) Well then why do women focus on beauty so much if it is actually maker them appear weaker? It is mainly because beauty and specifically beauty products are targeted to make women feel more confident and more beautiful. Someone might ask well then if its advertised to help you feel better about yourself why would that be bad? And that is because of who is behind all the selling and advertising of these beauty products. It is big corporations who are just trying to make money and most of the time are controlled by men. These people know that society pushes \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d, which then allows men to profit off of women\u2019s insecurities and twisted mindset that they need to be more beautiful. \n        This journal called, The beauty myth: Prescriptive beauty norms for women reflect hierarchy-enhancing motivations leading to discriminatory employment practices, goes into further detail of not only how \u201cbeauty norms\u201d leave women with less power but how they influence women to be discriminated against. The introduction of this journal makes a good point of exactly how women\u2019s progress has also allowed beauty standards to develop to replace \u201ctraditional ideologies\u201d that gave men a type of power over women. They explain how these expectations of women\u2019s appearance, set by society reflect a correspondence to sexist hierarchy organizations that want to prevent the growth of women empowerment.\n        Along with the deceiving way sexist hierarchies have made profit off of women using beauty products they have also imposed great discomfort for women by producing harmful beauty products for a men\u2019s benefit. For example, Chinese mothers forced foot-binding on their daughters to increase their chance of marriage. Another example is corset tops and high heels which can cause internal organs to move and damage to feet, but make women appear more attractive and allow assistance for instability on their feet. It is obvious that these practices used by women were encouraged because in some way it made men feel more powerful. \n          While the practices talked about previously were harmful, most of them are no longer encouraged by society but over the past decade eating disorders have been higher than ever in the United States. If you open a magazine, turn on the T.V., or even go shopping you will notice that most women included are thin. Especially in today\u2019s society women have idolized and obsessed over the idea of being \u201cskinny\u201d and \u201cthin\u201d. \n        The Beauty Myth and Female Consumers: The Controversial Role of Advertising, is a chapter in a journal that goes into greater detail of how \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d effects the dangerous market targeted towards women. In the beginning of this journal, it states major concern for the increase in eating disorders and body dysmorphia occurring in American females and what exactly the cause of that could be. The first suspecting cause is the promoted food and dieting in American Culture and that even taking a look in food magazines that \u201cfood advertisements focus more on dieting than on quality.\u201d (Stephens, Hill, Hanson, 139) This reveals just how unsafe our society has prioritized being \u201clean\u201d and that even food magazines talk about cutting down on food. The next issue possible causing this is the images of girls and girls that are looked up to and the kind of body they have. This idea of being \u201csmall\u201d and \u201ctiny\u201d has become a trend for American girls and is then set by fashion models, Miss America, and girls in pornographic magazines. Because the beauty standard of what a woman\u2019s body should look like is represented everywhere, most women feel the guilt that they do not look like that and can turn to harmful ways of looking the way they do. The dieting industry has grown because of this, even though they have been hit with lawsuits claiming the dangerous effects, the trend of being thin boosts the products that they sell.\n           In this journal included a survey done by Wooley and Wooley (1984) and it provided trouble data about women and the toxic body dysmorphia that continues to excel. In the survey they used 33,000 females and their ages ranged from 15 to the age of 35 and they were asked about their opinions about their body\u2019s and how they managed weight control. The results are shocking because only 25 percent of the women were \u201coverweight\u201d but 75 percent of them believed that they were considered fat. \n           This research ties back to advertising and how they know that if they use an \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cskinny\u201d girl in their ad that the women consumers are more likely to buy because they feel the need to look like this. There is a cultural idea that women have to look a certain way and when women are dissatisfied with the way they look they are more susceptible to giving in to products that will make them look the way they want to. This is where you can start to see the cycle, that there is someone who is money and power-hungry using women\u2019s insecurities and wanting to conform to societies beauty standards as an advantage to help them. \n           Growing up as a female in the United States I have experienced many of these pressures to achieve the beauty standard. It is extremely hard as a teenager growing up and trying to remember I don\u2019t need to change to society\u2019s standards but yet they are shoved in my face almost every day. Seeing these \u201cperfect\u201d girls all over my social media makes me feel like I am not \u201cbeautiful\u201d even though the collective concept of beautiful has been altered to be an unhealthy standard for women to aspire to meet.\n          As technology has advanced in America the ways men and power-hungry corporations can promote unhealthy beauty standards is baffling. Even in the news there is talk of how celebrities can \u201cPhotoshop\u201d and change they way they look so that the public will only see an unrealistic picture of what they look like. This then sets expectations high for regular girls and women to appear like that as well. Now in 2021, you never know if anything you see is ever a real raw image and the probability that it is is very slim. Since society has pushed this \u201cbeauty Myth\u201d unconsciously, it has prompted people to feel the need to look perfect and that it is necessary in order to be beautiful. The scariest part, like I said earlier, is that society is not necessarily doing this on purpose but the people who help promote it know exactly what they are doing. \n       All of these journals and articles lead back to a basic concept of \u201cThe Beauty Method.\u201d That although women feel more empowered in society than ever they also feel at their weakest. And with thr incline of exposure of the misunderstood meaning of \u201cbeauty\u201d , this has become harmful to women everywere. When the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d was first introduced the media and online networks were not like how it is today. Now the women and models we see on posters and television are most likely not a real image. There are so many ways an image can be altered in the slightest ways to make you think it is reality. Naomi Wolf informs in her article that \u201cbeauty is the last one remaining of the old feminine ideologies that still has the power to control those women whom second wave feminism would have otherwise made relatively uncontrollable\u201d ( Wolf, paragraph 4) \n         Overall, the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d is at its highest peak than ever. As Wolf explained, economies depend on the representation of women within the beauty myth, meaning that women are being trapped in this ideology that the economy profits off of only because of how it negatively effects women. The reason I believe it has gotten worse is from what I have said before technology and the ability it has to spread images and create false images. This allows the people holding the power more power by creating a false and unattainable measure of beauty to ultimately leave women coming back for something more again and again. The ultimate and pressing reason the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d is causing more damage than ever is because of the physical and emotional impairment it has imposed on women. The high development of eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and the feeling women experiment of never being \u201cbeautiful enough\u201d in the recent years just goes to show why this ideal is harmful. The pressure society puts on women is outrageous and if these beauty expectations keep growing it will become extremely detrimental to women\u2019s health.\n\n                                                                      Works Cited \n\nRamati-Ziber, Leeat, Nurit Shnabel, and Peter Glick. \"The beauty myth: Prescriptive beauty norms for women reflect hierarchy-enhancing motivations leading to discriminatory employment practices.\" Journal of personality and social psychology 119.2 (2020): 317.\n\nAmbivalent attraction: Beauty determines whether men romantically desire or dismiss high status women.

        "text": "1874\nKnow Your Audience\n\tSimilarly to James, Erving Goffman theorized the idea of \u201cThe Presentation of the Self\u201d, which essentially compared personality to a stage. He claimed that your \u201cfront stage\u201d is your fa\u00e7ade, while your \u201cback stage\u201d was composed of your true, raw self, unfiltered. In your \u201cbackstage\u201d is where you prepared your presentation for your \u201cfront stage\u201d, which is what the world would see. For example, when you are out at a bar with your friends, your \u201cbackstage\u201d prepares your fun, silly, energetic part of your personality to put on your stage. However when you come home alone at the end of the night to your bed, you are your raw true self: \u201cthe backstage\u201d. Goffman used the analogy of the stage to put emphasis on the fact that our brain is always putting on an \u201cact\u201d. He said that in no matter what social context, our backstage is always working to prepare the front stage to perfection.\n\tInterestingly, Goffman and James\u2019 ideas have the capacity to go hand in hand. The \u201csocial self\u201d is essentially a combination of the front and back stages. The back stage defines the role you are playing in the particular social context, while the front stage performs the different social self you must be playing. The idea of knowing your audience is especially important in both James and Goffman\u2019s theories. Without social awareness, how could the backstage possibly know which social self to present on it\u2019s stage? Without knowing the context of the musical, how can a marketer know which audience to target their show towards? An additional point in Goffman\u2019s theory of the stage has been recently related to the use of social media. Current sociologists compare his theory to the idea that social media is also a stage\u2014one who\u2019s play never stops running. Your image is curated by your backstage in order to portray yourself how your followers want to see you. James would say that your defined role in social media determines the kind of content you are putting out for your followers. \n\tEven though William James and Erving Goffman\u2019s theories were multiple decades apart, their similarities are uncanny. Personality is a big component of both theories, especially the variations of personality that are portrayed throughout your day to day basis. James\u2019 main idea about role identification in the social self directly correlates to the function of the backstage in Goffman\u2019s theory of the stage. Essentially, the job of the backstage is to identify your role in context, so the front stage can present the appropriate version of the social self. Whether that be a loving, compassionate, helpful husband in the morning, or a strict, powerful, controlling boss during the work day, your backstage is always working to identify the role you are playing to put forth the correct identity.",

        "text": "Final Essay Reflection\n\tWhen you were a child, I'm sure you wore silly costumes and the most obscure outfits without thinking twice about it. Going to school in wacky outfits, playing dress up with siblings, and back-to-school clothes shopping were considered the highlights of childhood. Yet, the older you get, the more you feel the pressure of society to look, act, and dress a certain way. You stop playing dress up and no longer wear your old favorite shirt with bananas on it. We as individuals are expected to constantly fit into the molds society has made for us and adapt to the changing trends. While men and women are both held to obscure standards in the world, especially regarding beauty, women get the blunt end of it. \n\tAs a female growing up in an ever-changing world with constant changes in appearance, I experienced the blunt end of the beauty myth. Going back to middle school, I vividly remember I was drastically different than the majority of the other girls. I was existing for myself and no one else until I came to realize what society expected of me. I began to face high amounts of bullying based on my outward appearance and began to feel excluded from my fellow peers. I took those years in middle school to change everything about myself before I entered high school. I changed my hair, my clothes, my makeup, and the way I dressed to please others. I felt the weight of society's expectations and felt as if in order to be happy, I had to fit in. \n\tOnce I entered high school, I aimed to be more fit and active in the community so I began coaching youth soccer. I used to play back in middle school and the passion carried on into high school and college. I am very knowledgeable about the sport and am very involved. Since I am a female, I have often gotten snarky looks and slick side comments about my ability to coach as a woman. I was no stranger to hearing \u201cShould we request a new team?\u201d and \u201cI don't think she will be as good as the male coach we had last year\u201d. I even found that I was constantly doubting myself. Based on the ideas I had in my mind of the ideal female soccer coach, I would constantly compare and ridicule myself. I felt like maybe I didn\u2019t look as athletic as I should or maybe I wasn\u2019t as fast as I should be. The ideas and pictures that have been instilled in my mind and in society caused me to overthink. The beauty myth had infiltrated my life, making me feel unworthy. I felt like I had to overcompensate in attitude and energy to make up for what I felt I was lacking in outward appearance. \n In my very first year of coaching, I worked alongside a male counterpart. He was there to show me the ropes, strategies on how to interact with the kids, and effective teaching methods. Oftentimes when at practice, the parents as well as the male children tended to flock to him. I would do my best to conversate and interact with them, but no matter how hard I tried, it was not enough. I realized this is because of the stereotypical idea that sports are a male-dominated field, reigning supreme while having vast knowledge and ability. Once I began to coach independently, I relayed to the parents I have previously played and coached and was adamant about having good communication with them. While they did trust my word, I could tell that they were still skeptical. They felt like since a woman was coaching the team, the instruction their kids were receiving would not be as good as if a male counterpart coached. In other words, they felt cheated. \nSimone De Beauvoir perfectly encapsulated my situation and how women are portrayed. Beauvior described women as \u201cothers''. Women are constantly being seen as inferior to men, falling into an entirely different category that is deemed not as worthy. Women are held to high standards in regard to beauty and \u201cwomanly skills\u201d. No matter what status or ability a woman has, she is still not as recognized as her male counterpart. Yet, while women are incredibly powerful beings, they are deemed incapable of doing traditional male skills, events, or activities.  \u201cAs is indicated by the common use of man to designate human beings in general; whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity\u201d (Beauvoir, 1972). The male population has dominated many of the more successful jobs, roles, and titles in society. This leads to a majority of men having more advantages, higher wages, retention of success, and more. Men have more power, influence, and supremacy in society, therefore, women are put on the back burner, becoming a group of  \u201cothers\u201d'. \nThe idea that men are the default power holders dates back to the beginning of time. Take sports, government officials, and first responders for example. When we look at these fields and their lasting influence on America, we see that a majority, if not all, are dominated by the male population. This is the driving factor in the suppression of women. Beauvoir paints an elaborate picture of gender inequality and how women are perceived as less adequate in society. Both writings from Wolf and Beauvoir emphasize how women are considered less than and objectified. These readings really put into perspective how unjust and unfair women are treated in our world. Women have fewer rights, higher rates of objectification, and a smaller rate of success in career fields in the majority of the world. \nWith all this being said, I can often be part of the problem. Society has drilled these beauty standards, roles, and ideas of women into our minds and we are taught from a young age a woman\u2019s \u201cplace in society\u201d. I tend to look at fellow women and judge them based on conventional beauty standards. I tend to experience a feeling of shock when I see a woman do a tough job that is traditionally completed by males. I know these thought processes are common for a majority of the population. I saw it firsthand from my experience coaching soccer. Those parents gave into the \u201cwomen as other\u201d concept and I let the beauty myth engulf me. \n The way women are perceived and treated in our society impacts the way we operate as a whole. Women are considered maids, cooks, and moms. Men are seen as the breadwinners, the successful, and the strong. This creates a large gap and divides in our society that ultimately continue the cycle of gender views for decades to come. In order to break this precedent, we must stop viewing women as others and instead provide them with equal opportunities. It is necessary to ensure equality and fairness in order to demolish outrageous beauty standards and promote the success of the female population. \n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDeBeauvoir. Woman as Other.

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n30 November 2021\nSecond Reflection Essay\n\tAfter reading 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari, I have found that he not only relates to some of the things that we have talked about in this class but he also seems to disagree as well. I believe that he would agree with Mead\u2019s way of finding ones true self but would disagree with Durkheim\u2019s view on religion. Well he would not fully disagree but I do not think that they wold see eye to eye on  a few things regarding religion.\nIn Harari\u2019s book he made a chapter that is title religion. In this chapter he talks about religion and how it contributes to our society. He believes that religion does serve as a foundation for the society we live in today, which is very similar to Durkheim\u2019s view on it. However, he does in fact believe that religion could be a negative thing as well. In this chapter he asked this question \u201cSo how relevant are religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism? Can they help us solve the major problems we face?\u201d (Yuval Noah Harari) To follow up his question he then made a list of three problems that are relevant to the 21st century. These three problems included technical problems, policy problems, and Identity problems. For each of these problems he gave an example to give more base to his argument against religion. The example for a technical problem was a farmer\u2019s solution to severe droughts that are caused by global warming, then for policy it was what measures should the government come up with to prevent global warming. Lastly, for identity problems he gave an example that basically asks if you should even care about what the farmers problems are or if you should only care about your people. Out of these three problems Harari believes that religion only plays a part in identity problems and does not really help in the others. In fact, he believes that religion contributes to the problem instead of solving it at all. He says that traditional religions have lost their vantage to science because unlike religion scientist can learn from their mistakes. Them learning from their mistakes gives them the ability to gradually learn to do things like grow better crops and develop cures and better medicines. Because of this traditional religions are starting to lose authority in these technical fields as they lean more toward scientific approaches. \nReligion towards the economy also does not seem to do much according to Harari. He says that religion would not give us the answers that we need to be able to solve any economic problems that we are faced with. This is because people back then have no idea how to tackle modern day problems that we are faced with now because they never had the chance to experience them. Without that experience how can the Bible or Quran provide answers that are needed. Instead of these books being a source of true knowledge Harari believes that are nothing more than a source of authority. He thinks instead of relying on religion that we should rely on Karl Marx, Milton Friedmen, Friedrich Hayek, and modern science of economics (Yuval Noah Harari) to get the solutions that are needed. Also, he speaks on how religion separates people. It does this by giving people a firm structure of what they should do in life. This may cause a very religious person to view something differently than another religious person. Because of this religion does not really have too much to add to policy debates and economics. Instead, it causes more argument and disagreement between people because they are more bias towards one side of an argument because of their viewpoints.\nNow, I do believe that Harari does in fact believe that religion is a building block for the society, but I also believe that he thinks we should not rely on it as much as we did before. He believes that it is doing us more harm than it is good and that we should start relying on more modern things like science. I think that Durkheim would disagree on relying on science. The reason I say this is because Durkheim believes that society needs religion. Religion is a critical part of society; without it we would not have the society that we have today. He believes that religion provides purpose for people, authority, and means for communication. It acts as a magnetic force that pulls people toward one another. With that being said, I believe that they would agree that religion does help a person\u2019s identity problems, but I think that Durkheim would not want to stray from religion like Harari would suggest. Without religion, the strong foundation of our society, we would fall apart. That\u2019s where the disagreement would come in hand. Durkheim\u2019s a firm believer in religion, while Harari does believe it was necessary in a sense back then and may have helped then, but that it is not much of a solution for problems that we are faced with now.\nIn 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari speaks about meditation and how important it is to him. Through meditation he was able to learn more about his self and other humans by observing his sensations. Through meditation he was able to fully understand his emotions and find peace within his self. He found his true self. He stated that he did not have to accept any story, theory, or mythology, and that all he had to do was observe reality as it is. That is how he found the answers he was looking for, not through religion or other people but through himself. Therefore, I would say that he would agree with Mead\u2019s concept of the self. With both the external component of the self that has to do with social interactions, and the internal feelings that are needed to understand yourself. By meditating Harari is starting to learn more things about the society we live in today and his self as well. This has opened his mind and helped him to find answers that he could not have found before. Mead\u2019s theory of self is very similar to this, and it was the first thing I thought about when reading this chapter. Through meditation Harari is about to find the \u201cI\u201d aspect of himself, he realized that the only mind he can truly observe is his own. He said that he now meditates every day for about 2 hours. During this 2 hour he observes reality for what it is. I believe that can kind of tie into the \u201cme\u201d or external aspect of the self. I say this because the external aspect focuses on reality and the social aspect of life and how it affects us. I know meditation is not social because while doing so he is not out talking to other people. However, he is finding answers about other humans through his mediation. I believe he is doing so by thinking back on social interaction he may have had while meditating and by doing so he not only learns more about himself but others that he may interact with daily. Harari also states that \u201cconsciousness is the greatest mystery in the universe.\u201d (Yuval Noah Harari). He believes that if we do not find the time to learn more about ourselves that algorithms and AI will eventually take over leaving us useless. In order to find ourselves Harari wants us to look deeper, and to recognize and understand our feelings and sensations. Once we find ourselves then we may understand one another and start to agree on things. If we can not do so however Harari does believe that the algorithms will end up doing that for us as well and that there will be nothing left for humans do to. We would be nothing but an empty shell that relies on machines to tell us what to do, what to buy, and how to think. This is why he wants us to look deeper into our mind and to gain self-awareness and a self-image. Which goes hand and hand with Mead, who also believes that our self is found through the conscious as well. They both would agree that the self is not something that is evident at birth because Harari did not even truly understand the person he was until he started meditating. Mead believes that the self comes over time and is found by experiences that you have throughout your life. Harari needed the experiences in his life to lead him to the path he is on now. With out doing the things that he has he would not have found out how to meditate and he would not have found his true self. \nIn conclusion, Harari\u2019s book has presented many strong points with lots of evidence to back up his claims. He shares similar beliefs with both Mead and Durkheim in a way. I believe that his view on meditation and him find his self would cause him to agree with Mead\u2019s concept of self. While his view on religion would support Durkheim\u2019s in a way but would contradict it as well. Durkheim believes that religion is a strong base of society, and that society needs religion, while Harari agrees, but also believes that religion can cause more harm to the society than it can good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\u201cGeorge Herbert Mead: The Self, \u2018\u201cMe\u201d\u2019 & \u2018\u201cI\u201d\u2019 - Video & Lesson Transcript | Study.com.\u201d Study.com, 2019, study.com/academy/lesson/george-herbert-mead-the-self-me-i.html.\nYuval Noah Harari. 21 Lessons for the 21St Century. 2019.\nWallis, Wilson Dallam. \u201cDurkheim\u2019s View of Religion\u00bb .

Women have tried to push their idea of feminism around the world attempting to prove that they are worth just as much as men and are just as capable to hold the same jobs, participate in the same tasks, and the list goes on. The collective conscious comes in to play when expressing how society has this view on gender roles and how a male and female should act in their unique ways. It is important for people to try and stand up against these said norms in an attempt for equality. ",

        "text": "7879\nReflection Essay\nReal men don\u2019t wear nail polish. This is a statement often said by traditionalists and even some who claim to be progressive. The societal structures put in place have created rigid gender stereotypes and expectations for the entire population to conform to. In reality, gender is not a binary logic and it\u2019s not easily defined into two categories. Children are taught at a young age about what is masculine and what is feminine and that they should lay claim to one depending on how they were born. In reality, most people are not comfortable accepting that men can be feminine and women can be masculine because of how we\u2019ve been conditioned. \nAs a man who wears nail polish I have received many compliments and also criticisms along with brash assumptions being made about me. This social anomaly has posed new social problems for me when moving to college and engaging with people that I've never met before. In one specific instance, a close female friend that I had in the first semester revealed to me that she thought that I was gay until I started dating my girlfriend. Considering that this was someone I considered a close friend, I was shocked to hear that she made that assumption about me. This friend also made numerous comments about me wearing nail polish and would refer to me in a demeaning manner as a \u201cFashionista\u201d. \nI\u2019ve also encountered people passing judgments on me because of the fact that I wear nail polish since I\u2019ve moved to UNCW. Most people see it as something that only women and gay men do because it\u2019s \u201ctoo feminine\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d. Many of my male friends have a hard time believing that I was a captain of my varsity Soccer and Basketball teams in high school because I\u2019m seen as feminine and not athletic. However, this is not to say that some people do understand that painting my nails can be a form of self expression and creativity and by proclaiming that nail polish is only available to women can be a very harmful idea. I've found that in a heteronormative and hegemonically masculine environment, being a man and painting your nails leads to symbolic violence from your peers. When women engage in what is thought to be traditionally masculine activities like being highly competitive in sports or being the breadwinner of the house it contradicts the idea of \u201cDoing Gender\u201d. \nWest and Zimmerman present \u201cDoing Gender\u201d as a concept for how we are conditioned to conform to traditional gender roles in our heteronormative society. Essentially, we are taught what is okay and what is not okay for our assigned sex to do in order to be an effective member of our society. We are taught that certain genders are expected to do certain roles and gender is merely a social construct. West and Zimmerman argue that humans are not born performing their gender but that it\u2019s taught through social experience and parental influences. We use \u201cDoing Gender\u201d as a way to easily recognize and organize ourselves in today\u2019s society. One\u2019s sex category and external identifiers determine the social expectations for their gender which ultimately create the act of  \u201cDoing Gender\u201d according to West and Zimmerman. \n\tHegemonic Masculinity is a sociological concept that covers the idea that men are to act as the dominant gender in society in order for their role to be legitimized. The widespread ideas that men are to be tough, aggressive, and competitive are what support Hegemonic Masculinity. Hegemonic Masculinity supports that men should be the logical and independent gender while women are the dependent beings. \u201cFeminine\u201d traits such as painting your nails or being emotional are seen as weak if a man engages in them under hegemonic masculinity. While the practice of hegemonic masculinity attempts to benefit men in our society it ends up doing quite the opposite. Men who force themselves into these roles suffer from internalized mental health issues and the encouragement of this practice leads to an increase of sexual violence. \nThe subordination and objectification of women is also a factor of hegemonic masculinity that should be recognized. By placing men as the dominant gender, this concept of hegemonic masculinity effectively places women as the subordinate. Women are oftentimes seen as places for emotional support by men who support hegemonic masculinity. This idea also supports the \u201cwomen as trophies\u201d outlook that some men hold. This explains why painting your nails and caring about your appearance can be seen as trying to appeal to the dominant and ultimately being weak. \nWhen applying the concept of \u201cDoing Gender\u201d to my experience of being seen as homosexual or unathletic for painting my nails, the situation becomes easily understandable. Since we are taught from a very young age on how to \u201cDo Gender\u201d we are conditioned to look for certain traits to help us legitimize and identify other\u2019s roles in our society. My friend on campus, even being as progressive as she is, could not accept that painting my nails is a form of creativity and self expression. Instead she interprets my decision as an expression of femininity because that\u2019s what \u201cDoing Gender\u201d has taught her to do. She associates certain traits to certain genders and sexualities so her system of identifying is essentially disrupted when a straight male paints their fingernails. The conditioning of \u201cDoing Gender\u201d can be combined with the ideas of Hegemonic Masculinity in order to see feminine traits as weaker traits. \nHegemonic Masculinity when applied to my situation, explains why some see me as unathletic and soft. This idea of masculinity influences my male friend\u2019s decisions when they make the assumption that since I\u2019m not a domineering male, I\u2019m essentially weak and unathletic. The mix of hegemonic masculinity and doing gender can help reveal how the two are related through the lens of my own experience. The act of painting my nails leads others to believe that I am \u201cdoing the gender\u201d of a female which brings about the assumption that since I am engaging in what is seen as \u201cfeminine\u201d qualities that I am weaker and less athletic according to hegemonic masculinity. \nThe concepts of hegemonic masculinity and doing gender can be used to dissect and help explain the reactions that different people have to a male painting his fingernails. I have come to reveal that the action of a straight male painting his fingernails creates a contradiction that isn\u2019t easily digested when looking through the lens of \u201cDoing Gender\u201d. Additionally, The feminine act of wearing nail polish in the minds of hegemonic males creates the perception that it\u2019s a sign of weakness and fragility. These ideals are not applicable to every single person in our society of course but they do help form most social contexts in the United States. We have to change how we think of gender, sexuality, and traditional roles as a society in order to make strides against these constructs. Educating others and creating a diverse community in which others can be provided with perspective and understanding is an important first step. These are not problems that can be solved overnight but social change is ignited through institutions and also social experience so shifting the narratives of your own community can help immensely.",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n18 October 2021\n\nReflection Essay\n\tRace is a social construct that is used to separate people with different features into groups. This way to characterize others is used as a way to create social ranks in society. These \u201cranks\u201d are used to give power to one group of people, while keeping others down. An example of this in society would be the undying issues between whites and blacks. Still to this day you can see discrimination of blacks in almost everything. Blacks have come a long way by fighting for rights that they should have been born with, all because of their skin tone. They are discriminated and have always been discriminated in the US because of their race. Because of a social construct that was created by humans to separate each other. So, I always ask myself, why? Why is it that we still hold on to something as trivial as race, something that does not biologically separate humans in the slightest?\n\tGrowing up in an African American household I have always asked myself that same question. I always wondered why my dad would always give me talks about the world and how it would be a bit harder for me than white people. Or why I had to do certain things differently just so I would not get in trouble. As a kid I did not understand any of this I would just sit there and listen. Once I started going to school that is when I started to finally develop an understanding of what he was trying to warn me about. I started learning about things like slavery, segregation, and racism in class. I Started learning about ways blacks were kept in a lower position and were treated and something less than human. Eventually I started seeing these things happen in our society today, a society that is supposed to be equal and fair to all. It is far from fair and have never been fair in the slightest. Yes, blacks may have more rights now and can do many things that they would have been punished for years ago. However, there are still many ways that blacks are held back by their race in this society. \nThe first example of discrimination because of race would be the workforce. Blacks are constantly being discriminated in the workforce and have trouble getting jobs. In one of our readings for this class we read an article called, \u201cDiscrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment.\u201d This field experiment was carried out to determine if there was still discrimination in the workforce. During this experiment there were whites, Latinos, and blacks that were all give equivalent resumes that applied to hundreds of jobs to see who would have a higher chance of being hired. Needlessly to say whites came out on top getting hired the most while blacks were dead last. In this field study they even saw ways that the employers would reject blacks. For example, some of the employers would use a person qualification against them. Certain qualifications were weighed a bit more for a person depending on their race. In the article they talk about a black man that was rejected because he had little to no experience that was needed for the job. However, his white and Latino counterparts were not rejected like he was from the job even though they had the same amount of experience. In the article it was also stated that not only did whites beat out blacks in a 2-1 ratio but that a white male with a criminal record did about the same as a black male with a clean record. Not only do blacks have trouble getting jobs over their counter parts they also are more likely to face racism than any other race in the workforce. There are also less black CEOs than white CEOs. For example, Fortune has 500 companies and only 4 of them have a black CEO, only 4. Businesses are still relatively low in diverse leadership and studies show this.\nMy next example of discrimination would be the incarceration rates of African Americans in the US. I was reading an article from CNN a few days ago and in that article, it was stated that black Americans are incarcerated almost five times the rate of whites. I did not find this information to be surprising at the slightest. In America blacks have always had higher numbers of imprisonment than any other race. In fact, African Americans make up 30 percent of the United States population but the make up 60% of the prisons (\u201cIt\u2019s 2020. Why Is Workplace Discrimination against Black People Still a Problem?\u201d). The US had a war on drugs that was used to crack down on illegal drug use and trafficking. This so-called war on drugs was really used to incarcerated African Americans as it mainly focused on black communities. The Human Rights Watch found that blacks were not anymore likely to use drugs than whites but still suffered higher arrest rates. During this time in America many blacks were threw in jail for petty crimes but were given lengthy sentences. Imprisonment is also a problem in black youth in America as well. Studies show that African American juveniles are being put into juvenile detentions at astonishingly high rates. The Sentencing Project shows that while African American juveniles make up 16 percent of the United States youth population, that a whopping 37 percent of their cases are transferred to criminal court. While 58 percent of African American youth is sent to adult prisons. (\u201cIt\u2019s 2020. Why Is Workplace Discrimination against Black People Still a Problem?\u201d). These studies show just how much more blacks are incarcerated than any other race in the United States today.\nAnother way blacks are discriminated in the US is through voting. Voting is a right that blacks did not even have and was something that my ancestors not only fought for but died for. Throughout US history there were always laws that were put in place to prevent African Americans from having a fair vote. Voter suppression is a real problem in the US that still has yet to be resolved. Voter suppression is a tactic that was always used to keep certain people in power. It causes unfair elections by not giving everyone an equal chance to vote for who they would like to. African Americans used to deal with literacy polls, poll taxes, all-white primaries, more just because they wanted to vote. Blacks had to deal with these voting restrictions for 95 years until the Voting Rights Act was established in 1965. It took that long for the government to make voting fair for blacks. If you look at our government it is mainly made up of whites, our first black president was the 44th president. This shows just how unfair the voting is in America. \nThese are just few of the many ways that blacks are discriminated in the US. Blacks are discriminated in almost everything they do. There is always someone who holds on to the past and believe that another person is superior because of their skin color. Things like that should not matter in modern day society. It should have never matter. How we look on the outside should not characterize us as a person, nor should it give someone else power over us. I should not have to fear being pulled over by cops, or have more trouble getting a job, or have to worry about my vote not counting. It is 2021 and black people are still fighting for rights in the US, is that not sad? All because of the social construct that was put in place to give power to people that believe they are the closest to what they believe God is. \nIn conclusion, race is in fact a social construct that is used to divide people amongst each other while making one group superior to all others. So, to answer my own question I would have to say that a trivial thing such as race is held onto so that people of the so called \u201csuperior\u201d race can maintain their power in society above others. People use race for any and everything. Race is used to determine if you get a job, if you can get into a school or not, if you are going to prison, or to determine the person you are. Race should not be something that determines any of this, but sadly it is. We are all and undoubtingly human no matter our skin tone, hair texture, and facial features. So, I do not believe that race should be used as a social hierarchy, everyone should be treated as equal no matter what. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBr, et al. \u201cBlack Voting Rights and Voter Suppression: A Timeline.\u201d Www.cnn.com, www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/05/politics/black-voting-rights-suppression-timeline/.Evans, Farrell. \u201cHow Jim Crow-Era Laws Suppressed the African American Vote for Generations.\u201d HISTORY, 13 May 2021, www.history.com/news/jim-crow-laws-black-vote.\u201cIt\u2019s 2020.

        "text": "Sociology 105-007\nMay 2, 2022\nThe Idea of the Beauty Myth\nHave you ever fallen into the idea of the beauty myth? Although it is something we as humans do almost every day, understanding it is a different story. The beauty myth can be described as, according to Wolf, as the order that dictates behavior and not appearance but rather the beauty of a women based upon the duty to base the identity and value of it. The idea being that beauty is subjective and that beauty women do not disagree with men. This idea falls victim to the idea that women are only seen for the they appear rather than their personalities: everyone has their own idea of beauty. \nThe idea of the beauty myth has been something I have been interested in since we read about it. Throughout my life, in school I have always been told that \u2018men are the bread winners\u2019 and women should always look presentable for their man. However, at home it was always the opposite, my father would tell me that man or woman, it does not matter if you are happy and at a good job it does not matter who the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d is. Yet, it still surprises me that to this day men and women are still so polar and the idea that men success is based on if he is with a beautiful woman. I know from personal experience that I have been catcalled. Catcalling could mean when you are walking down the street and a man says something to you, it is most likely an uncomfortable experience and extremely awkward. Being told from a young age that men will always make the money and women are just supposed to stay in the kitchen, watch after the children and clean honestly sounds like a good deal until something sparks in you and you want to make your own money. My whole life I always wanted to be a CEO or own my own my business like my father did, however, people always told me that owning your own business was for men and only men could handle those jobs. My father always believed in me and wanted me to succeed in whatever I did. However, down the line I decided that teacher was for me, I love teaching, children and being able to make a difference in one person\u2019s life. Even with that profession, comments are always made about that idea. After learning about the beauty myth in class it made me realize how often and prevalent it is. For starters, a stereotype that has always stuck with was that being a stripper is morally wrong. However, being a stripper could make you money extremely fast and if someone wants to do that and loves what they do, there is no reason to degrade them for it. I also completely disagree with the idea that men are breadwinners and women should not disagree with men. Not only is that false but the idea that women are less than men is extremely unfortunate. I feel as if man or woman we should all have equal opportunities and dreams to do what we want to do no matter the stereotype. \nTo go into further detail, the beauty myth is the almost a backwards way of men trying to reinforce their male dominance. However, the beauty myth has nothing to do with women at all and everything to do with a men\u2019s institution and power. The overall idea is that women should be beautiful, and men should have access to it. Furthermore, beauty is subjective, and women are subjected into the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d by feeling the pressure to adhere to the unrealistic social standards of physical beauty. Another point to be made would be that now, social media has completely changed the idea of being beautiful. Women are constantly comparing themselves to what they see online, some in which are due to the idea that men love beautiful women. \nI believe there are many new insights to this topic, which is why it fascinated me so much since we read about it. I believe that although this is happening and the idea that women are valued as less. As a woman we should stand up understand that we are all beauty in our own ways and do not owe ourselves or our beauty to anyone. I also feel as if women should be starting their own business and companies, fulfilling their dreams with no reproductions about what a man might say or react to our decisions. The beauty myth is such an eye-opening topic, especially for women, and understand what it truly means I feel like everyone should do in order to fully understand. \nThe beauty myth is something completely assumed by a myth, hints the name, it is all a myth. Men should not be valuing their success on how beauty their women are, they should be appreciating what women do and putting their value into their own success. I feel as if that no matter a person, their value is based on many things, and what they do in this world is a main one. If you decide you hate life and want to sit at home all day, obviously your success is less than someone who prides themselves on being a hard worker and making each day their all-time best. However, success is the spectrum, and that person sitting at home all day on their couch may say going to the store was a success and they are proud of themselves. Success is what you make of it, and no one should belittle someone even if they feel like they are more successful. In my opinion, I feel like my parents are the most successful people, not only from their jobs but from the people they have become. Inside and out, they are successful in my eyes based off how they raised me, I would say my brothers and I are all extremely hard workers and will always make the most of any situation we are in, good or bad. \nAfter taking this class, I can proudly say I have learned so much in \u2018finding meaning\u2019. Although I have taken a sociology course in High School, I have forgotten the importance of it and how extremely interesting it is. Learning about beauty is something I had to take a step back on and understand deeper, I left class and wanted to learn more about it. Therefore, I had to do my own research on the topic. I learned so much from diving deeper and have a good understanding of what the beauty myth truly is. \nIn conclusion, according to Wolf the beauty myth is the idea that as women increasingly focus their attention on their physical appearance, their focus on equal rights and treatment takes a lower priority. The idea is that men base their success of the beauty of their women and women should obey them and never disagree with them. However, women should be proud of who they are and work for what they want no matter if a man tell you to or not. ",

        "text": "1884\nFinal Paper on Gender and Gender Inequality\n\tWhy as women in a friend group of men we are technically in, still somehow out unless there is a convenience to them? As women, we are only seen objectively even if we are in close relations with men. Whether it be in a relationship way, or even just a friendly way, we as women will never and have never been seen as equal in a society ruled by men. We as women continuously fight to be equal and to just be seen by men as something worth more than using or looking at. That is why I would like to discuss how women are othered by men, objectified, and put under a beauty myth even in friendships with men. No matter what title you have with a man, there is a consistent inequality and that is what I would discuss.\n\tIn my personal experience, I am the only straight female in my friend group, with there being only two other women. As you may be already thinking, I definitely hear and am a part of what men my age feel and say about women. I think when we think about inequality between women and men, we don\u2019t discuss how crazy it is that it even exists between friendships, not just professional and love lives, and day-to-day strangers. These are people in my life who I count on and depend on, but when it comes down to it I am not equal to them in the slightest. There are a few examples to show this and what I have personally experienced.\u00a0\n\tTo start off, my guy friends basically treat me like their no strings attached girlfriend. They are very flirty and make comments that as guys in a friend group, you should not be making. They only do this with me and don\u2019t do this with my other two friends who are lesbian. I believe this is because of the standard of beauty they have in their heads. Stereotypically, I have features that fall under the normal standards of beauty women follow. However, my lesbian friends don\u2019t follow those standards and are beautiful in a not your typical women's way. So, in my friend group, the guys are definitely more friendly with me than they are with my other friends just because of how I stereotypically look. They flirt and everything like that, even though we are clearly just friends, and do it just because they can\u2019t see me as just a human being to them but someone they need to be sexual and flirty towards.\u00a0\n\tThis leads me to my second topic, they see me as nothing but an object and when they do see me as more since we are just friends, it is almost demeaning. This is probably the most frustrating thing out of all of the things that they do, but anything that has to not do with my experience when complimenting me is \u201cactually\u201d. One of my guy friends when I make a joke always has to burst out laughing, even if it isn\u2019t the funniest thing he has heard, and says that I am \u201cactually\u201d really funny. The first time he said it I didn\u2019t mind it, but over time it gets frustrating to be seen as actually something. That's also not the only thing said, I am also \u201cactually\u201d smart, interesting, or in general anything that gives me any sense of value, but I can\u2019t help but feel like that value is taken away with the word actually is then added to it. Even when they see what is good about me, they are shocked by it and add surprise to it just because I am a girl, they don\u2019t do this to any of the guys in the group it is just me. So why is it a shock to them that as a girl there is more worth to me than how I look? This is why it is so incredibly frustrating to try and be equal when the closest thing they can say to make me equal isn\u2019t even worth saying.\n\tMy last example is the fact that they reach out or hang out when it is convenient for them. My guy friends are never the ones to arrange any kind of hangout unless they are getting something out of it besides just hanging out with me, or they need someone. I invite them places quite frequently and so do the other girls in my friend group. Yet, the only times that they really want to hangout out are asking us to hang out is when there is a party where there are girls, or something along the lines of it being convenient for them and them physically getting something out of it. Secondly, when we do hangout and aren\u2019t up and going somewhere, they expect me to listen to all of their issues with other girls and give them advice, whether they listen or not they don\u2019t say anything else about the discussion and they don\u2019t even bother to ask me about my life or anything, they only care about whether something involves them or not. If it does not involve them then they do not care the slightest. This is why it feels like I am just separate from the group and only a part of it when they get something out of it for their own satisfaction.\n\tIt is important to look at the topics that go along with gender equality, starting with Simone de Beauvoir's theory of othering. Beauvoir describes othering as men seeing women as \u201cthe other\u201d. Basically saying that men are the dominant group and then there are just women, who are under a completely different, lower category compared to a man. Men are subject and women are presented as an object to men and nothing else. Making women the \u201cother\u201d in the eyes of men. An example of othering for women would be in the workplace men listen to men before they listen to women for advice or answers because they see them as the other and would rather hear from a man from their own group. Women are seen as that objects that it nothing for than their bodies so women aren\u2019t listened to.\n\tMy second concept to discuss is Naomi Wolf\u2019s beauty myth. Wolf describes the beauty myth as the absolute need to be a certain way as women and the completely unrealistic and sometimes dangerous lengths women go to try and be this stereotypical definition of beauty. Men only feed into this myth along with social media as well as telling us what we should and shouldn\u2019t look like. An example of this is seeing a model on Instagram who is obviously in very good shape, who has perfect features, long hair, and things of that nature, and we as women feel the need to fit into that section of beauty in order to make a way in society. With this not only does it make women insecure and put other women down, it completely has altered the male mind as well as what women should look like in society too.\nMy final concept is from Sigmund Freud and how men are towards women and why. Sigmund Freud says that men are drawn to women who look and/or act like their mothers. As men they want someone to take care of them and nurture them and listen to them and then go off and do whatever else they want to do. For a mother-child relationship that is okay because that is what moms do for their children, however, it does not work as well in a love relationship. For example, men like to boast about themselves to women they are romantic with, and have them glorify and praise them just like when a child does something they are proud of they want their mom to look immediately and be proud of them.\u00a0\nUsing this topic of Sigmund Freud in my experience goes along with my experience that my guy friends only talk to me when it is convenient for them. They will talk to me when they want something and then they don\u2019t talk to me any other time. Also, they come to me begging for advice or when they need someone to talk to, but usually don\u2019t return that kind of action back. As Sigmond Frued said, I am basically just a mother to them who they can come to when they need something or when they need help and that is about the limits of how they act towards me most of the time.\u00a0\nMoving on to my second situation within my friend group, the beauty myth plays into my friend group and how they treat me because of it. As I was saying, there is a standard for women in society, and the constant pressure put on women is created through this beauty myth. With this beauty myth, men are 100% involved in it and those are the standards of women they are shown meaning that is the standard of women they believe is achievable even though a good majority of the time it is not. My friends are friends with me specifically because of how I look and are a lot friendlier to me only because I am a part of whatever they consider the beauty to them. However, this beauty myth only objectifies women, and like in my friend group I am only seen objectively and for nothing else, so they treat me as if I am nothing more than a pretty face just because of their view on all women.\nLastly, Simone de Beauvoir and her theory on othering. I am 100% seen as other in my friend group than the men. They see me only as an object as they are subjects and anything that I say or do that adds value to me leaves them shocked because I am not a man and I am just the other to them. They see me as just a ditsy girl who if I do something a normal human being would do they see it as a shock because I am \u201cactually\u201d something, as opposed to them, which it wouldn\u2019t be impressive if one of them did it because of course as a man they can do everything.\u00a0\n\tIn conclusion, being in a friend group full of men doesn\u2019t make you feel like you are fully in the friend group, just someone who is there and worth nothing more than what they objectively see you as and what they choose to think and see about you on the inside. In society, I think many women have experienced this and have been made less than a group of men just because that is how men genuinely view them yet in reality women are capable and worth the same amount as any man is too. As women, we just want to be seen and be given the equality of men because it has always been this horrible challenge to even be considered as anything to men unless they are objectifying you. Women and male friendships are very much a part of that topic as well even though it isn\u2019t discussed as much as we may discuss other relationships between men in women. So, the point I am trying to make is there is a clear divide between men and women and although in our society we try to find to change it, there will always be some form of inequality between men and women just because of how men are psychologically and how society projects women.\n",

        "text": "SOC105\nFinal Paper\n\n\tLet Them Eat Cake \n\t\u201cIf you had a million dollars, what would you do?\u201d I asked myself the very same question. Once you\u2019ve covered all the things you\u2019ve wanted to do and help the people who are important to you, you\u2019ll still have more money than you know what to do with. Have you ever wondered how we are trillions of dollars in debt but power elites hold over 40% of that wealth? How are world hunger and poverty rates at an all time high and yet there are billionaires who have the resources and power to end it and still havent? Most recently with the COVID-19 pandemic, somehow the rich just kept getting richer. According to the institution for Policy Studies, U.S billionaires got 62% richer during the pandemic and are now up to 1.8 trillion dollars. How is it possible for the power elites, or top 1%, to maintain power? Why is it that the rich keep getting richer and the poor are getting poorer? \n\tThe power elite is a group of upperclassmen that hold the most power and influence over the decisions of policy makers. There are 3 groups of people who hold power in the power elites. There is the social class, the corporate community, and the policy planning network. The social upper class not only have immense wealth but also have influence over their own class-meaning they set the rules. The corporate community are people that are on more than one board of directors, holding many seats in largest corporations in the United States. The last group, Policy makers are people who have a direct impact on government policy.\n\tThe world has been facing a surge in economic inequality. Recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine exacerbated and accelerated the impact. The rich in America use Capitalism as a tool to continue to profit off of the hard working people of America. Americans are well accustomed to the \u201crise & grind\u201d mentality also known as Hustle culture. The government has been utilizing the working classes' efforts to overcome poverty the way a hamster is constantly running on a wheel. A conscious and free life is what distinguishes humans and animals. Under Capitalism, it subverts that nature by alienating the worker because unless you are at the top, all jobs are in some way or another alienating you. The more a worker works, the less that belongs to them to call their own.\n\tAccording to Marxist theory, alienation is a condition of workers in a capitalist economy resulting from a lack of identity with the products of their labor and a sense of being controlled or exploited. Commodity fetishism is the condition in which production is no longer seen as a social endeavor but as the simple exchange of money and commodities-the labor is severed as soon as it is connected to money. Due to this, the laborer does not get recognition for the effort or energy put into that commodity/product. Commodity fetishism is a direct result of alienation as people become obsessed with having the newest and coolest commodity. An example of this would be getting the latest iphone when it drops. The power elite control what is deemed valuable in order to turn the highest profit margin. \n\tDomhoff talks about why the working class has such little power in America and it boils down to 3 major reasons such as: Internal division, political frustration, and union defeat. The working class is so divided especially when it comes to race. In the beginning, African Americans had no social power or influence due to their enslavement-meaning there was no way to organize workers. Once they gained their freedom, prejudices in the white working class kept the 2 groups apart. The working class was unable to develop their own political party due to the electoral system greatly disadvantages third parties, so they had no other choice but to pick between Republican and Democrat. In both parties, they had no influence due to the power of the wealthy. The American system is a free market, based in Laissez faire liberalism, so American employers fiercely opposed interference with private property. This caused the working class to not have much luck organizing themselves through unions as employers were able to call upon the government to strike down unionizing. Employers were able to do this as they had great influence with politicians and the backing of a free market.\n\tAfter the Great Depression, the United States enacted a Keynesian economic policy. Keynesian policy created the conditions for high rates of economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s. Keynesian economics focused on putting more money into the economy and was equitable for all classes. This was not good for the power elites so they wanted to enact Neo-liberal economic policies. They were able to get rid of Keynesianism as it was not helping the economy anymore as America was already experiencing stagflation. Stagflation is a combination of high unemployment rates and high inflation. The power elite enacted Capitalism once more to fix this by raising interest rates and mass deregulation of the economy/ market to counter inflation and unemployment. This is how they were able to pass Neo-liberal economic policy that worked for them and lined their pockets that are still in motion to this day. \n\tIn the present day, the  American working class is still unable to garner power and unionize to enact policies that work to help the lower classes. An example of this would be Starbucks employees still trying to unionize for democracy in the workplace and facing major backlash from the company and lack of media attention to their cause. Starbucks themselves is trying to twist the narrative into being a healthy and supportive employer that offers lots of benefits. Starbucks workers are calling for improvements to said benefits and a democratic say in what's going on in their workplace and having the protection to do so. Workers are making less every year as wages don't go up due to inflation, they are calling to unionize as they see this matter as \u201clife of death\u201d because what happens at work will directly impact their families and quality of life. Inflation means less money and by choosing to unionize, workers are aiming to take back some control from employers so they can have a say. \nA huge and consistently rising issue Americans faceis the cost of living. Minimum wage is $7.25 an hour but it is not possible to live in an U.S county if you are not making $14.50 an hour according to the Economic Policy Institute. That is twice the current federal minimum wage. Minimum wage has been the same since 2009, which is the longest the U.S has gone without an increase. The federal minimum wage has lost 21% of its value since the last time Congress raised it in 2009. If Congress had continued to raise the minimum wage in line with the times, the minimum wage would be around $22. \nAmericans quit their jobs at a record rate in November of 2021. 4.4 Million Americans which makes up 3% of workers voluntarily left their positions, this movement has been called the Great Resignation. Economists have called this phenomenon an employee exodus which displays a deep dissatisfaction and discontent with present and previous employment situations. The pandemic has enabled the American working class to rethink their work/life balance,working conditions, careers, and long term goals. Many workers voiced their plights of feeling overworked, underappreciated, and underpaid as the top 3 reasons why they have chosen to leave their jobs. \n\tThe reality of American society is that the fates of many are at the hands of the few. The Rich have a hand in every American's plate and way of life. Ironically the American way of life has always been marketed to the world as the Land of second chance and new beginnings. Many people took a leap of faith and believed in chasing the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d. Through understanding these very harsh truths about the reality of the disproportionate power gap and highlighting that the power elites are really the ones who get a say on everyone's lives. However, we are starting to see improvement in the working class fighting back against oppressive forces and corporate agendas. Although there are many faults and necessary improvements to be made in our society, there is hope spread amongst the younger generations to unite together and raise awareness to the very skewed distribution of wealth and actively working to bring the change needed.",

        "text": "SOC 105-007\n29 April 2022\nDress\n\tGender roles have been attributed to biological differences in men and women. The concept of gender roles was introduced by John Money, coining it as the actions that reveal the status as a boy, man, girl, or woman. It is universally known that men are integrated in society to provide for their family, be in charge, and always portray bravery. Women were meant to be the caretakers of the household and follows the man\u2019s orders. All throughout history these stereotypes have existed but recently, the stereotypes are slowly disintegrating. It is no longer black and white, meaning that masculinity and femininity is fluid. Society has labeled what is considered masculine and feminine which pressures the fulfillment of the roles. Recently, the two distinguished categories are blurring together and switching. In the broadest sense, they provide normal behavior, attitudes, and hierarchy values. People have found ways to resist the gender roles by new ideas such as women\u2019s rights, nationalism, and socialism. Gender roles have been made important towards society because they organize the necessary tasks in early human society. Doing gender furthers into the effects of the roles in males and females. The male role represents that men should dismiss emotions, while the female role encourages the feeling of being overly emotional. \nThe December 2020 Vogue magazine cover holds an image of Harry Styles wearing a Gucci jacket and a dress. Styles says, \u201cI find myself looking at women\u2019s clothes, thinking they\u2019re amazing.\u201d Not only was this British pop singer the first-ever make cover star but also wore women\u2019s wear. The designer, Harris Reid, and Harry focus on gender fluid clothing, making a statement. Days later, Candance Owens, a conservative author and commentator, posted on social media causing a spiral. She mentioned how disgusted she was with the Vogue cover and used the phrase, \u201cbring back manly men.\u201d The attacking of Harry Styles continued for a whole month since the release of this magazine saying the dress is not masculine which is ruining society. In response to Owens, Harry posted an image of his cover with the caption saying, \u201cbring back manly men.\u201d Some supported Styles while some supported Owens, as well as the other way around. This occurrence brought inspiration to the song writer Charlotte Sands who wrote the song \u201cDress\u201d about Harry\u2019s cover. An actor, Billy Porter, also created backlash by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not dragging Harry Styles, but he is the one you\u2019re going to try and use to represent this new conversation? He doesn\u2019t care, he\u2019s just doing it because it\u2019s the thing to do.\u201d\n\tDoing gender is the things we do to lay claim to a sex category where gender is performed. It is a psychologically ingrained social construct that surfaces everyday interaction. Differences are created between girls and boys and women and men. These contrasts are socially made through interactions, but some people think of it as \u201cessential\u201d and innate biological differences. The female group has the stereotype of having kids and wearing make-up, dresses, and heels. The males are made out to be the protector, holding doors for women, and having a male stoic strut. Men are meant to not wear make-up, women\u2019s clothes, and high heels. These actions are behaviors that are expected in society. The body is a resource, but gender is not in the body because there are no essential gender characteristics. The control of your appearance is the outward appearance and how your sex identifier is presented. The model of socialization suggests that it is a lifelong process of learning and then relearning the gender expectations. Doing gender is breaking the gender rules but can also be where you passively obey. An example of doing gender is considered a social construction. When a door is opened for a female by a male, it is being polite and a gentleman. Society exhibits how we should act, dress groom, speak, and conduct ourselves on the assigned sex. Females are expected to be nurturing, polite, and accommodating while men must display strength, competitiveness while not displaying emotion. \n\tMasculine and feminine qualities is labeled on how society is performed. People are expected to perform a gendered role and are held hostage by the sex identifier. Gendered stereotypes are slowly changing but there are still a lot of gendered expectations. The stereotypes are now open to interpretation which assists in freedom of expression. The dress symbolized breaking away from the stereotypes, tolerance, and creativity. It aimed to stir a debate among the industry because Harry Styles believes that establishing barriers just limits ourselves. People view the cover as going against societies norms where some are in support while others find it unnatural. As Owens believes that it is not manly, actress Jameela Jamil said, \u201cHarry Styles is plenty manly, because manly is whatever you want it to be\u201d and not what was decided a hundred years ago. This British singer broke all the doing gender norms and is still continuously breaking them. Not only does he dress feminine but does not want to constantly display emotionless behavior as men have been painted to be. Clothing should not make a person masculine or feminine and historically, dresses have been worn by men for over a thousand years. For example, the British in the Middle Ages wore skirts and tights, and the ancient Greeks and Romans wore togas. Too many believe that in order to be \u201cmanly\u201d you have to act and dress a specific way. The pantsuit, which is originally catered towards men, is now acceptable for women. There is an unconscious negative bias that men express towards femininity which is known as toxic masculinity. Not only has the fashion aspect has altered with doing gender but so has the jobs. The workforce was once consumed of men but now has been transitioning into women taking the roles of \u201cmanly\u201d jobs. \n\tDoing gender has always been in society but in this day and age, the stereotype is being challenged. Men and women are surrounded by the idea of fitting a specific role that is integrated mentally and physically. A way these categories are changing are by blurring the masculinity femininity line. Harry Styles made a strong statement towards this by the outfit choice of wearing a dress. Controversy appeared, creating support and disgust. Although it is more common with the fluidity of gender, it wavers back to default only because society has not fully embraced the erasing of stereotypes. Besides the ability to wear any type of clothes, jobs have also altered. For example, men were primarily the doctors while women were the nurses, but that is no longer the case. The male to female ratio in the workforce began without being equal which now sets back the women. Finding equality overall can only be accomplished if femininity and masculinity are not as analyzed. Gender blurring introduces the concept where a man behaves as it is expected of women, while a woman\u2019s behavior follows the male character than the female one. While the two-category culture is pressurized, doing gender is still relevant today. They do however hold no real significance to human society because they were made up which means that they can also change. Doing gender can exhibit many forms but can also stay compact in the two categories, creating a never ending cycle.",

        "text": "0043\nSOC 105-008\n1 May 2023\nThe Self Reflection Essay\n\tIs the conception of the self based off the way we perceive ourselves or from the perspective of others; and do the environments we are placed in influence our behaviors? Although, it might seem that we are constantly critiquing ourselves it is seen that the emergence of modernity has shaped the notion of self. One knows who they are, how to act, and when to act in particular ways because of others and their influences. It is a common thought that we are self-aware, but I posit that we are not because within the situation it is difficult to fully grasp this idea. In a report it stated most people believe they are self-aware, yet only 10%\u201415% of people actually fit the criteria. In western society, it has been noticed that the majority of identities these days come from the perspective of how others perceive us rather than the raw portion of our personalities and what makes us unique for who we are. To understand this concept, one must examine the constituent parts of the self and how they are related to human behavior within different environments. \n\tIn high school I went to a private Christian school where we would wear uniforms and take the most challenging courses in order to be a college preparatory school. While in this setting I was surrounded by everyone who seemed to be there for the same reasons. One, they had money to afford a prestigious school, two, parents wanted their children to be around other Christians so when they left for college they would have a solid foundation, and lastly in order to receive an education that was top tier in the area. As a background as to why I went to this school in the first place is because my family has a legacy there. All of my siblings went to high school at Asheville Christian Academy and my father served on the board. In a sense I did not have the choice whether I wanted to attend. This perspective does not disregard my gratefulness for having the opportunity to attend a college preparatory school though. Yet, from my experiences I have felt that there were moments that did not encompass my true \u201cself.\u201d \n\tBecause I was surrounded by the same type of people in high school where we quite literally all looked the same due to the fact, we wore uniforms I think it created a stereotype in which I found myself often times having to pretend to be more Christian than I was in order to please my friend group and teachers who were very religious. For example, each Tuesday the entire high school would have a convocation and chapel. This included a time of worship in which we would all sing. In order to please others, I would sing along even if I didn\u2019t feel emotionally connected to the words or meaning of the song. \n\tThis situation at high school to conform to the stereotypes of Christianity and present myself as something that I was not emotionally engaged with is a pure example of Goffman\u2019s idea of the presentation of the self. This idea presents that we are always presenting ourselves. He uses a stage as an analogy is where our interactions are produced. The front stage is where we are being presented and must be polished. So, in my situation my idea of the front stage was to act as if I was religious in front of my friends, family, and teachers so that I could appease them. Then, the backstage is where things come together. Before school I would need to prepare myself to act in this way so that everyone would think I was just like them. It was like a coat that you put on and then take off. If I had not bought into feeling the need to act like someone, I was not then I feel like I could\u2019ve had the opportunity to discover my true self in high school rather than in college.\n\tNow that I am in college here at the University of North Carolina Wilmington as a freshman I have experienced what I would say would be a culture shock. Coming from the background of always being surrounded by the same people in high school I have found that college is much different than that. I have met many people who are from many different backgrounds. I have felt that I have been more able to express who I am and explore who I really want to be. Yet, there are times that I wish I could find a church group because my family always asks me about that when I come home, because I would like to please them and the standards that they have for me. Here at college, I have experienced that one often gets looked down upon for being religious as from experiences with one of my friends who hates on people who are semi-religious. I have a couple of friends who are like me but ultimately it is difficult to find the right people, but this is by choice rather than being forced.\n\tI think the difference between high school and college is that in high school I didn\u2019t have as much of a choice as to who I was around, but here at college there is more diversity allowing me to be more open and find myself. Although, I do still struggle sometimes with the presentation of the self and having my identity being influenced by others, I think this in turn plays into James\u2019 idea of the self and how we are perceived. \n\tThis has a direct correlation with James\u2019 idea of the self. He breaks it down into 3 different parts. The material self which includes clothes, property, friends, and family. I experience this in the way that I am constantly making sure that the clothes I wear fit into what everyone else has. The social self which is my role and reputation is seen through the lens that I want to fit in with my friends here at college and go with the flow. And lastly the pure ego which is the core of my spiritual self and the life force that creates my reactions is what I know is deep down my moral spectrum that won\u2019t allow me to do anything bad during my time here at college. Through the different perspectives of the self, I personally agree that I resonate with all of these on a daily basis to appease the people that are around me.\n\tI also resonate with Mead\u2019s idea of the I and the Me. He explains how the Self is experienced out of internal dialogue between the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cMe. Therefore, the \u201cI\u201d is the subjective reaction of the mind to the stimuli. So, in my experiences many of the external forces of others and the people I surrounded myself with was the \u201cI\u201d in these situation. Yet, the \u201cMe\u201d is the objective evaluation of the \u201cI\u201d reaction. So, the \u201cI\u201d came from my natural reactions, and the \u201cMe\u201d would be like an off and on the switch to act accordingly based on my environment. Therefore, the nature of myself can be seen as the nature of the language of society and the particular settings that I have been located in.\n\tThrough the presentation of the self, the idea of the self, and the I and the Me I have been influenced many times to conform to what society has told me to do. Yet, in order for one to combat the issue of conforming to society and finding identity in our true selves we need to believe in ourselves and act accordingly for what we think is right for yourself not what society says. Based on my experiences, I am still learning how to do this and how to surround myself with people that I feel like I can be myself in. \nWorks Cited\nGoffman, Erving. The Presentation of the Self.

It not something that is engraved in our human biology but is rampant throughout people in countries around the world. The flags that represent countries become a collective representation for nationalism and can inspire for the better or even for the worse. \n\n\n                  Instead of dismissing the idea of Nationalism as a whole Harari suggests that the world finds a way to come together to solve problems. I think that this world has gotten used to having pride in your own country to the point where we don\u2019t realize the many thing we could do if we shared and collaborated as a whole. This would be changing the way we use nationalism and not using it as a way to be better than everyone else. ",

        "text": "850622656\nHow does social media shape the way we view ourselves?\n\nCooley\u2019s theory called the \u201cLooking glass self\u201d is mainly about how we think others view us, but not how they actually view us. It is more of a personal perception in our heads. If you think about it like a light switch in our brains, like when it\u2019s on you try to force the people around you to view you a certain way and even when they dont view us in this way, as long as we think they are happy. When the light switch is off, you don't care how other people view you, but it also depends on who you are surrounded with or talking to. For example, You might tell your friends that you drank so much last night and were so drunk, but would you tell your professor these things?.. No, because you want your professor to view you in a different way, like a different version of yourself. \nWhen thinking about Social Media, there are infinite options of how you can portray yourself. Many people are one person online, so everyone can view them the way they want to be seen, but behind the screen they are completely different and could have a completely different lifestyle. We tend to post the best versions of ourselves on social media, even if it's not who we truly are. You always see famous influencers posting about all these new things they just bought or this super fun day they had and all these positive things, but that\u2019s not who they are all the time, it's how they want you to view them. No one ever posts about anxiety, depression or things surrounded by negativity, but because we have this human tendency to want everyone to see us in a certain way, we show our best sleeves all the time for people to see online. In reality, we post on social media to shape an image of ourselves in other people's eyes. The big picture around this whole idea, is that we don\u2019t want others to see us how we see ourselves, so we make us this version of ourselves online, so viewers will see that and not the real you.\nWilliam James created the theory of \u201cThe Self and its Selves\u201d. He believes there are 5 main parts: The Self, the material, the social, spiritual, and personal identity/pure ego. The social self is most important because it is the recognition you get from your friends.We have this tendency and desire to be noticed by our friends or people around. The social self makes you change yourself based on the social situation you are in. For example, friend groups are an example of the social self because it provides you with a positive social identity and feeling of  a sense of belonging. Overall, this part of self, is how we are seen and recognized by others. This theory means a man has many social selves and there are people who recognize him and carry that image of them with them. Although, we only care about certain groups' opinions.\nAgain, Social Media takes a big part in this. We all have a social self, the self the world sees, the part of us that we want everyone to know.Its the words we use to present ourselves and the overall image we present to the world. This social self is an image we control, it is portrayed by us, and it confirms that people don't see the bad moments or the vulnerable parts of us. Social media allows us to present ourselves in a whole different way, than you would normally present yourself, which at times can be scary. In a way the social media self is your social self, you have been portraying different groups and people. \nWhen comparing these two theories they have similarities and differences. To start one similarity between both of their theories is the emphasis on the role of social interactions in the development of the self. James and Cooley both talk about how our self-perception is shaped by how we are perceived and assessed by others. A difference between the two theories is the way they both defined the self. Cooley defined the self in a means of how we feel, like self feeling. Whereas, James on the other hand defined the self as different parts.\nIn conclusion, I think Cooley's theory is more rational because it is relatable to how the world is today. Social media has a negative impact on the way we view ourselves and causes us to portray a person online that isn\u2019t the real us. The \u201cLooking glass theory\u201d is how we feel about ourselves because of the way others view us. I would choose this theory, because it relates to me personally. I feel like I am constantly worried about what people think of me and it portrays how I think of myself.",

        "text": "Estranged Labor vs. Rationalization\nWhile rationalization and estranged labor both touch on aspects of the human experience in today's capitalist society, they approach the subject from different angles. Rationalization studies the objective changes of social institutions that comply with logical principles, and estranged labor focuses on the individual's personal experience of alienation within the labor process. Despite these distinctions, both ideas provide insightful understandings of the difficulties and intricacies of modern socioeconomic systems.\nThere are similarities and differences when comparing rationalization and estranged\u00a0labor. These ideas emphasize how people simply become parts of a huge, emotionless machine in today's capitalist society, which has the alienating consequence of destroying uniqueness. However, rationalization focuses more on the objective rearrangement of social processes and structures, while estranged labor highlights the subjective feeling of alienation among workers.\nIn addition, rationalization is frequently presented as having two sides, whereas estranged labor typically highlights the negative consequences of capitalist exploitation. While it does\u00a0promote\u00a0economic growth and technological advancement by bringing about previously unattainable levels of efficiency and organization,\u00a0it can also result in the loss of deep personal relationships, the uniformity of culture, and a breakdown of established social institutions.\nImagine an assembly line setting in a modern manufacturing facility, where employees have been tasked with operating machinery to make consumer devices. During the day, every employee completes the same tedious tasks\u00a0without interruption. Due to management's strict enforcement of result goals and quality standards, they have little control over the speed at which they work or the outcome.\nWorkers who\u00a0experience estranged labor feel disconnected from the products of their labor, which they rarely see in their completed form. The completed devices are transported off to distribution locations without their input or recognition, which separates them from the rewards of their labors. Because they become little more than parts of production, the repetitive nature of their jobs creates a sense of boredom and disempowerment. A\u00a0lasting sense of alienation may result from the employees' feeling more and more cut off from their jobs, their coworkers, and even their sense of purpose.\nRationalization principles guide the factory's operations. To simplify the assembly line, the production process is carefully planned, distributed among workers, and optimized for efficiency. Standard Operating Procedures\u00a0are carefully followed to guarantee accuracy and reduce mistakes. Additionally, management uses data-driven research and performance metrics to satisfy market expectations and continuously enhance efficiency. Rationalization lowers costs and boosts output, but it also dehumanizes workers by treating them like interchangeable parts in the industrial process.\u00a0\nThe contrast between rationalization and estranged labor in this scenario highlights the complex structure of present-day industrial capitalism. Although rationalization promotes production and efficiency, it also makes workers feel more alienated, reflecting the deeper disputes that exist in capitalist systems between the needs of the economy and the well-being of people.\nBoth rationalization and estranged labor are useful lenses\u00a0that\u00a0view the processes that make up modern industrial capitalism, but they have advantages and disadvantages of their own. Marx's concept of estranged labor highlights the gap between people and the outcomes of their efforts and successfully portrays the subjective sense of alienation that workers feel inside capitalist institutions. \nHowever, Weber's idea of rationalization offers an organized structure for examining how social systems are reorganized in line with logical principles. It provides insightful information about how different aspects of society are rationalized. Rationalization has come under fire for putting efficiency and predictability ahead of human values and creativity, which has resulted in the alienation of the world and the collapse of established social systems. \nRationalization and estranged\u00a0labor reveal distinct aspects of a common phenomenon: the degrading effects of capitalism on people and communities. We can better understand the intricate details and mysteries present in current capitalist society and the urgent need for substitute models that put the well-being of people before achieving the goal of profitability by analyzing these ideas in unison.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105\n4/29/2022\n\n\tFrom the moment a child is born they are proclaimed as either boy or girl and unknowingly, so is their social identity. Sex can be classified as a characteristic of the body while gender is the set of roles that are taught. Therefore, it\u2019s fair to say that they are distinctly different. Our society instils upon the idea about how men and women should and should not behave which result in harsh gender stereotypes. For centuries, society has been driven by masculine men over dominating women and making patriarchal institutions a natural way of life. Sex and gender are highly debated topics and by breaking down their fundamentals and discussing their differences, society can better understand them. \n\tAs a woman, I have had moments in my life where I have recognized and experienced gender-based stereotypes. My entire childhood and early adulthood I was a competitive dancer and was primarily surrounded by women. I was taught at a very young age that dance was not a sport because it was just a \u201cgirls sport.\u201d I had played plenty of sports throughout my youth and had never been scrutinized for participating because they were \u201cboys sports\u201d such as baseball and soccer. My father was also a huge factor in my development of gender-based stereotypes. He is a very strong-opinionated masculine man who insisted on telling me what I could and could not do because I am girl and was one of the people in my life who guided me to think the sport, I played was not valid because it was a \u201cgirls sport.\u201d One of the most detrimental things about these so called \u201cgirl sports\u201d is that body image plays a huge role. In sports heavily containing girls like dance, cheerleading or gymnastics you will almost never see a girl who is seen as \u201cfat.\u201d All these sports involve tiny, thin little girls because that is what is what society expects of them. The saddest part of this expectation is that it leads to issues like body dysmorphia or eating disorders. This type of stigma is very different, however, if you look at male dominated sports like football all you expect of them is to be strong whether they were seen as heavy or not. As much as I love the sport that is dance, I cannot deny the pressure that came with maintaining a socially accepted body. \n\tThe media has become one of the most influential ways to distribute information and give insight to people\u2019s personal affairs. Whether it\u2019s a movie, magazine, podcast or television show, gender stereotypes are made and are discriminated. The media portrays men and women in extremely different ways. Women are portrayed as being beautiful and desirable and primarily sex symbols while men are portrayed as being overly masculine a dominating. If you were to look up a music video for a song, say Lil Wayne, I almost guarantee you will find women in either provocative clothing or doing something sexual. The women are almost like moving props to attract an audience or just a selling point to the video. With that said, its also notable to mention that the lyrics to these types of music videos are just as equally shameful. The genre of rap has been one of the most negative media outlets for gender stereotypes because its one of the most popular types of music amongst this generation. As said in the previous paragraph, I used to be a dancer and one style I did was hip hop. The style of hip hop is heavily based around rap music, and I remember being a preteen/teen in middle school dancing to songs like \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d or \u201cHot in Here.\u201d To make matters worse I would sometimes have to do provocative movements just because it went along with the lyrics. \n\tCollective consciousness is a sociological concept that refers to a set of shared beliefs that are common to a specific social group. As part of being a female, women learn these gender stereotypes and tend to just accept them and go on their lives. The first wave of feminism took place in the late 19th century and their initial attempt was to organize a national movement for women's rights. Feminists drew in sight from abolitionists and the French Revolution. Often sides were dominated by men in the often did not allow women to speak freely in front of a male dominated audience and women were often mocked for speaking out of turn. One of the most popular topics of the feminist movement was women suffrage and not a lot of people agreed with these values, but the activists believed that their goals would not be impossible without the right to vote. The 19th amendment would soon be able to be ratified however it only guaranteed white men women directed vote while on the other hand black women and other people of color were denied that act until decades later. The goal of feminism was to challenge the inequalities of women that were faced on a daily basis in at this time they were well met and continued to progress throughout history\n\tMost of society seems to think that sex and gender are very much the same but by analyzing it from a sociological perspective it can be agreed that sex denotes biological features and gender denotes social factors. Gender is the social interpretation of sex, and it is conceived of masculinity and femininity. Cultures interpret the anatomy of a body rather than the cultural characteristics of the person. Author De Beauvoir Claims that \u201cone is not born but rather becomes a woman and that social discrimination produces in women moral and intellectual effects so profound that they appear to be caused by nature.\u201d This means that females become women through a process where they acquire traits and learned behavior. They are casually constructed and have a role and bring individuals into existence and shape the way men and women are socially.\n\tYou come into this world with a sex, but society influences whether you choose to be masculine or feminine. When we are born our sex determines how we will be treated and what we will achieve. The way we view sex can determine how we will be treated and more so through outlets like media and society. Society defines a set gender role and enforces it. In life we are born with a sex but are given the choice of gender and through that we choose how to express ourselves. Outside influences such as media and society or friends make us conform to these gender roles. In today's generation it is becoming more acceptable to be who you truly are but it was not always like that and we need to learn where and when these gender roles were set and how much they impact our lives. \n\n\n",
