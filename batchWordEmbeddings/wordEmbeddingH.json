This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In reality, one\u2019s class means more than one\u2019s character, and money does so many more things than we realize. In this short essay, I will talk about the differences between what we are taught about class in society and what the readings from class said about the importance of class in the USA.\nGrowing up, everything was about money. Even if I saw a nickel on the ground, I picked it up because I didn\u2019t want to \u201cBe poor\u201d. Although I was only 6, and overvalued those five cents more than life, I still understood the potential consequences of not having money to pay for things. From the youngest ages, Americans are indoctrinated with the idea about the division between rich and poor, and we are taught that money is the key to happy living. After reading the excerpts, I was further convinced (I already had some kind of idea) that money isn\u2019t everything. While it is important for living, we don\u2019t need to live in an excess of money to be happy.\nIn the first reading, George Mantsios gives myths and contradicting realities about classism that were really meaningful. The most impactful myth that he gave was that everyone has the equal chance to succeed, given enough work. I liked this because it brought out the obvious stupidity found in so many myths about class and privilege. Not everyone has an equal shot at success, because success in America is based on your education and family, and those contribute to your income. A lot of people don\u2019t get that access to education and strong family, so the majority of them start off at a heavy disadvantage. In the third reading, \u201cFrom Colonialism to the Coup\u201d, there was a statistic that showed the percentage of the national income that the top 0.1% own. If it was an equal distribution, it would have shown that they have less than 1%, but in 2010, they owned about 10% of the national income. This means that the top 1% must own even more. I did my own research, and it turns out that the top 1% of wealthy Americans owned a shocking 38.5% of the national wealth in 2016. I don\u2019t think I can explain how shocking this is. It\u2019s crazy that there is that much of a disparity in the top 1% from the other 99%. They didn\u2019t teach us that in economics, all I heard was the importance of money for success.\nThe readings disproved every myth I had ever heard about the equal rights of all classes, and now it is quite apparent to me the importance of class in America. We run on a system dependent on the working class, who are so much lower in the eyes of the law and of other people.",

        "text": "SOC 105\nApril 27, 2023\n\nEmpirical Puzzle: Separation of Race in Schools\n\tRace is a modern concept in the eyes of sociologists. It was invented to put one group above another and provide a base for diminishing and demeaning the group it is being used against. Race is based on skin color and tends to be used as a weapon by the ones with lighter or fairer skin. This concept was used to justify slavery from the 17th through the 19th centuries. Now it is used to justify discrimination and separation. In my time, I have witnessed this in every aspect of society, stemming from school to life in the outside world. This brings us to the question of whether racism is still around today. An inquiry based in part on how our ancestors passed down their beliefs, and how they got instilled into people\u2019s brains over time. Yes, the concept of race and racism is printed into everyone\u2019s collective consciousness, though mostly unnoticed, and still plays a major part in everyday critical decisions.\nA pattern that seems to occur a lot in the United States is a modern version of segregation. It is not forced segregation, but more of a voluntary separation that happens because of the imprinted concepts and ideologies in our minds. Personally, I have noticed this throughout all aspects of my life, but the most noticeable spot has been in school. When you walk around school, you tend to see everyone cliqued up with the people that they hang out with and most of the time they look the same with similar cultural backgrounds. The collective consciousness is in some way at fault for this way of living because people of differing ethnicities have lived separately for the majority of the United States\u2019 existence. This causes static in the growth of society because without mixing cultures, there will be no advancement towards peace in humanity. \n\tThis puzzle starts with the sociological concept of race vs ethnicity. The definition of race is the categorization of humans that share the same physical appearance and social qualities. The definition of ethnicity is belonging to a group of people with the same cultural background. People tend to mix these two concepts up or think they are the same thing. The government uses them to categorically divide the nation by sending out the census where you are required to lay claim to a certain race and ethnicity. This makes it possible to put certain cultural groups to be above others in the social aspect. This leads to things such as workplace discrimination and residential segregation.\n\tThis residential segregation tends to divide the youth which as time goes on, grows and keeps people separate. As it says in an article by Think \u201cRacial residential segregation in the United States is the mechanism by which people are sorted into neighborhoods and communities that offer opportunity and deny it.\u201d This tends to mean that people of color in the lower or middle class usually reside in lower-opportunity areas (Think). While middle-class white families are able to live in better neighborhoods. Bringing them more and better opportunities in life. This separates us in many ways as people go to different churches and schools and play sports in different places. This just starts the segregation between races because you make acquaintances and friends that you stick with for the rest of your life. \n Devah Pager did a study on the hiring process discrimination. It showed many ways how jobs and managers treated and responded to different cultural groups when trying to obtain a job. The people who applied to these jobs all had the same resume, background, and social and communication skills.  The research conducted that white interviewees were twice as likely to have a positive response from the job as a black interviewee and 5% more likely than a Latino interviewee. Similar results happened when people with felonies applied. White felons were 2% more likely to get a positive response than Latinos and 4% more likely than black felons. This is known as subtle discrimination as it is printed into everyone\u2019s collective consciousness to have certain biases and prejudices that often go unnoticed even by the person doing them. It is the result of years of racism trickling down through society over time, making it impossible for anyone to not have a drop of racism in their mind.\n\tRacism has been a part of the United States since the founding of the country. The concept of the matrix of domination, explains that white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism all work together to reinforce each other. From the beginning of the country, the rich white slave owners were building their wealth and power while the black people were being held as slaves, making it impossible to grow wealth and status. The power elite holds the economic power in America and uses this power to exploit the marginalized communities that don\u2019t have access to good economic opportunities. They also held the power to exclude minorities and marginalized groups from getting good access to healthcare and education. \n\tMy experience with seeing the separation of races throughout society and specifically in school really didn\u2019t make me think much at the time. But these concepts we go over in class opened my eyes to the causes and repercussions of this separation. The concept of race gives people an excuse to degrade another group of people that don\u2019t fit the same physical image and social concepts as them. The way the government uses race and ethnicity to segregate the people of the nation through residency, access to needs like education and healthcare, and workplace discrimination. Systemic racism plays a huge part in many people\u2019s lives, and it is important to find the roots of these problems. Finding the roots is the only way to find a solution.\n\t\tThe nation is in a split and it goes back to way before any of us were born. The teachings and ideologies of our ancestors have been passed down and imprinted in our minds. This is a case of collective consciousness working against the people of the world. It is the fact that everyone has an underlying way of thinking that is not even noticed by the person thinking most of the time. This is how the youth becomes divided and continues to grow apart as they get older. Concepts like race, and ethnicity, and how sociologists view and research them show us how racism and discrimination run our system here in the United States. The youth of this country need to use this knowledge and listen to the older generation to see where they messed up and how we can fix it. With the way society is now our generation is on a path to finally overcoming racism. Youth nowadays are gaining an awareness of racism that hasn\u2019t been seen yet, on top of the awareness youth today are stepping up and protesting and speaking out on racism. Instead of sitting around and talking about what problems are occurring people are stepping up and fixing the world one problem at a time.\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nCollins, Patrica. \u201cMatrix of Domination.\u201d Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 3 Sept. 2014, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_Domination. \nWestern, Bruce. \u201cThe Inspiring Life and Career of Devah Pager.\u201d The Marshall Project, The Marshall Project, 14 Nov. 2018, https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/13/the-inspiring-life-and-career-of-devah-pager#:~:text=Conducting%20the%20experiment%20in%20Milwaukee,rate%20was%20only%2017%20percent. \nMenendian, Stephen. \u201cOpinion | Why Neighborhoods Are More Segregated Now than They Were a Generation Ago.\u201d NBCNews.com, NBCUniversal News Group, https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/u-s-neighborhoods-are-more-segregated-generation-ago-perpetuating-racial-ncna1276372. \nOmi, M.

        "text": "The Effects of Social Media on Self Image\n\n\tIn any social scene there\u2019s going to be some people that have higher status than others, on social media this is especially relevant and not the most ideal situation. While users gain their popularity and climb to the top of the applications fame, they can be viewed as role models and can inspire people to improve themselves, help others, and do good in the community. Other popular users don\u2019t utilize their reach for good and end up promoting products, goods, and services that will make them money but then the rest of us then feel like we need to be more like them. Oftentimes these promoted items are out of the general population's reach, making us feel as though we won\u2019t be able to become more like them resulting in us feeling down on ourselves. With these users being so easily accessible, these feelings become increasingly common.\n\tOther pressures of social media don\u2019t even come from the top users, but from common users feeling like they have to present their absolute best self on their own profile for others to see. In Christian Baccarella\u2019s article Social Media? It's Serious! Understanding the Dark Side of Social Media he describes this as \u201coversharing photos of positive experiences unintentionally causing anxiety among those who live less glamorous\u201d. This includes anywhere from the pressures of posting the perfect picture in order to get the much desired validation from \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d; to scrolling through your own feed and seeing your friends and others posts of that crazy international vacation they\u2019re on, or that fancy restaurant downtown that everyone wants to go to, or some crazy party that you didn\u2019t hear about in time inducing quick feelings of spite and jealousy. With everyone putting on their best fronts for social media it\u2019s easy to come across posts like these and feel down on yourself.\n\tThe American sociologist Charles Cooley\u2019s concept of the \u201cLooking Glass Self\u201d fits perfectly into the role that social media plays in our daily lives. The \u201cLooking Glass Self\u201d is Cooley's concept of how individuals view themselves based on two things; how we directly view ourselves in our own company, and how we perceive others view us. This concept was created in the early 1900\u2019s, prior to any advanced technology, but is still relevant in the fact that through social media, the thought \u201cwhat will everyone that sees this think of me\u201d goes through any users prior to posting anything. \u201cPresenting one's identity is a central aspect of social media\u201d (Baccarella), although more often than not, the \u201cidentity\u201d presented to that social media platform is the one that they want everyone to see; not the most genuine and realistic to that person's actual identity. This is because it is a part of human nature to think about how others will perceive them based on what they are doing, or in this case posting. In fact, prior to posting anything nobody has seen it, so we are basing our view of ourself off of how we think others will perceive what they are about to see. This is exactly what Cooley explains as the second part of how we view ourselves, based on how we believe that others will think of us.\n\tHaving most social media applications typically involve heavy photo-sharing by both peers and celebrities (Burnette), the users with big followings are able to visually show off how they\u2019re living and how they look, usually widely believed to be more attractive with near perfect physique. This combined with being backed by their social reputation, which \u201ccan be indicated by the number of followers someone has, the sentiments of the comments expressed about that user, the view and like counts for a user's post, or the status some platforms award to users\u201d (Baccarella), leads to their lifestyle being extremely sought after but near impossible to reach. The photo-heavy social media platforms nowadays lead to general users being more exposed to upward appearance comparisons, which can cause users to develop poorer body image (Burnette). The american philosopher George Mead had a similar concept of self-conception to that of Cooley, but was more general. His concept of \u201cThe Self, The I, and The Me\u201d was that \u201cThe Me\u201d is how the general society as a whole views someone, \u201cThe I\u201d is who that person is and how they act according to this view, and \u201cThe Self\u201d is the balance between both \u201cThe I\u201d and \u201cThe Me\u201d. This is prevalent in social media because with the popular users having such positive comments to a body image post, this can exert influence on young adults\u2019 perceptions of an ideal body and their own body perception (Kim). Making them not want to post pictures of themselves because they think society's view of their \u201cMe\u201d won\u2019t be good compared to those of the popular users.\n\tThe popular users having positive comments to body image posts isn\u2019t always a bad thing though. Because \u201cSocial media comments provide users with the ability not only to express their own opinion but also to monitor the other viewers\u2019 collective reactions\u201d (Kim), this allows for the ideal body image to be commonly believed among the social media community, giving some people a goal to work towards as opposed to an image used as comparison. This is more common in users with lower self-discrepancy due to the ideal body being believed to actually be achievable. Users with higher self-discrepancy are more likely to use these ideal body images as means of self comparison/evaluation due to the huge discrepancy and gap they already have (Kim).\n\tSocial media's influence on society and how people view each other is as dominant as ever, which causes many people to put up a front to blend in with the crowd. When viewing these famous social media stars\u2019 profiles it can be easy to get caught up in what to aspire for and end up comparing yourself to them, and everyone does it from time to time. The pressures of showing off your best self on social media will also always be around, but remembering that other peoples profiles are also fronts of their best life can help users to not feel as jealous or self-conscious of themselves when scrolling through their feed. It is and always will be in human nature to care about what others will think of you, but not focusing on this and being confident in yourself will lead to more enjoyable social media experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\nBaccarella, Christian V, et al. \u201cSocial Media?

        "text": "SOC 105\nJanuary 29th, 2021\n\nHuman development overtime has been more profound than any other animal in the world. Collective consciousness is what makes humans so special. Humans have developed the ability to share and create ideas in order to maintain stable groups which is beneficial for survival. In both mircofoundations and Alexandra Maryanski and Jonathan H. Turner ideas, we can compare the idea that language has endowed humans with art and symbolic thought which has lead humans to develop beliefs. \nIn Mircofoundations, it states that around 45,000 years ago the symbolic revolution must have been triggered by a random genetic mutation. This mutation improved the organization of the brain by affording humans the capacity for language and enhanced symbolic activity. Language increased sociality for group formation among human ancestors. By linking sociological concepts to sociability, humans are able to think symbolically to make things meaningful. Unlike animals, humans were able to develop strong emotional attachments to others and groups. According to Maryanski and Turner, cognitive, emotional and behavioral properties that evolved during the hominoid evolution are responsible for religious behavior and organization. Durkheim concluded that religion provided people with an explanation of their place in this world and allowed humans to cope with the uncertainties of life and provided affirmation and expression of the collective group. \nThe collective consciousness of humans has greatly expanded our ideas and beliefs. We began by creating languages and forming collaborative activity. The hominin brain was able to increase emotions and create meaningful symbolic thought. Overtime, humans created beliefs and religion from symbolism, and by creating groups, humans have utilized their collective consciousness to share beliefs, ideas and behavior.\n",

        "text": "Graded Essay #3\nWhen beginning to think about class, we usually break it up into three main categories: lower, middle and upper class. Although today, class identity has been stripped away from popular culture. In the readings of Class in America by Mantsios and The Power of Elite by Domhoff, we can separate their ideas of class between what our present collective consciousness is about class rankings in the United States.\nThe middle class in the United States holds a very small share of the nation's wealth, the gap between the lower class and rich and middle class and rich is larger than it\u2019s ever been. Mantsios states that we do separate ourselves, but we don\u2019t identify as our class ranking. The middle class is so large that associating yourself with 60% percent of the population doesn\u2019t really give one much of an identity they can call their own. Domhoff argues that the social upper class enjoys associating themselves with their status-quo. He believes that through institutions young members of the upper class and those who are new to wealth develop a shared understanding of how to be wealthy. Most, but not all, live expensive and exclusive lifestyles. \nIn my own experiences and some of our collective consciousness is that we do not associate ourselves with class. The middle class is so large, that it is difficult to distinguish between what is considered to be rich or poor throughout the United States. I do believe that wealth within the upper class does provide them with more power than people below them. We do not identify ourselves with a class ranking, but the class we live in does have an impact on developing our own identity. ",

        "text": "1790\n\nIn my life and the lives of others, I have noticed the harmful effects of social media on self-confidence and body image. From friends sharing their insecurities to countless posts advocating unrealistic beauty ideals, the pressure to be perfect is evident. The widespread presence of these images and their impact on people's self-worth presents a puzzle that can be examined through the lens of Wolf's \"The Beauty Myth.\" \nOne day, while studying in Randall with my best friend, we decided to take a break and catch up on each other's lives. As we were talking, she pulled out her phone to check her social media. She was scrolling through Instagram when I noticed her expression change, and a sadness washed over her. I asked her what was wrong, but she just shrugged it off, saying it was nothing. I couldn't help but notice that my friend became quieter and more withdrawn after that moment. I knew she had encountered something on social media that had affected her. Finally, after a bit of gentle prodding, she admitted that she had seen photos of influencers promoting an unattainable body image. The images made her feel insecure about her own appearance and fueled her self-doubt. \nIt\u2019s really profound how immediate and deep an impact a screen can affect a human being. Something that is so obviously fake, can influence our emotions on a serious level. These algorithms are specifically designed to make you feel a certain way. To garner your attention, and there is no intention within it that is good. On a moral level, there is no reality where this predation is acceptable. \nThis instance highlighted how the unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by social media, as described by Naomi Wolf's \"The Beauty Myth,\" could have immediate and profound effects on individuals like Sarah. Her self-confidence was shaken, and she began questioning her self-worth, wondering if she wasn't attractive enough to be valued by society. \nNaomi Wolf's idea of \"The Beauty Myth\" suggests that society's beauty standards are an oppressive force, maintained to keep women under control. According to Wolf, these standards are impossible to achieve and always changing, making sure women continuously strive for an ideal they can never truly reach. To better understand this concept, think about the fashion industry's promotion of extremely thin models as the ultimate beauty standard in the 1990s. This ideal was then replaced by a more athletic and toned appearance in the 2000s, leaving women trying to adapt to the new standard.\nUsing Wolf's concept of \"The Beauty Myth,\" we can now analyze the effects of social media on beauty standards and self-esteem. The constant flood of images on social media platforms, often digitally edited or filtered, strengthens the idea that perfection is achievable. This false belief increases the pressure to fit into these unrealistic standards, leaving people feeling not good enough and always chasing an unattainable goal. Moreover, social media algorithms often keep this cycle going by promoting content that aligns with these beauty ideals, reinforcing the myth's power.\nThrough the lens of \"The Beauty Myth,\" we can also understand how beauty has become a product on social media. Influencers and celebrities often take advantage of this myth by promoting beauty products and treatments that promise to help people achieve the \"perfect\" look. This commercialization of beauty creates a culture of consumption that makes money from people's insecurities, further embedding the power of the beauty myth in society.\nAdditionally, the beauty myth perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes that are detrimental to both women and men. For women, it reinforces the idea that their worth is primarily based on their physical appearance, while for men, it promotes toxic masculinity and the notion that they must adhere to specific body types and appearances. The perpetuation of these stereotypes on social media platforms contributes to a culture that values conformity over individuality and exacerbates the harmful impact of the beauty myth.\nBy understanding the role that social media plays in maintaining and promoting the beauty myth, we can raise awareness of the issue and encourage individuals to critically evaluate the images and messages they consume. Creating open conversations about the unrealistic standards perpetuated by the media can help empower individuals to challenge these ideals and promote a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty.\nNaomi Wolf's idea of \"The Beauty Myth\" offers valuable insights into the puzzle of unattainable beauty standards pushed by social media platforms. By understanding how these standards are oppressive and ever-changing, we can start to see the negative effects they have on people's self-esteem and mental well-being. Furthermore, recognizing the commercialization and consumer culture surrounding beauty on social media allows us to question the systems that profit from our insecurities.\nThe importance of this analysis goes beyond the world of social media, as the beauty myth is deeply rooted in society as a whole. By critically examining and questioning these standards, we can start to break down the oppressive structures that perpetuate them and work towards a more inclusive and empowering definition of beauty. In doing so, we can ultimately create a more just society that celebrates and values diversity in all its forms.\nOne potential way to challenge the beauty myth is through the promotion of body positivity and self-love. Encouraging individuals to embrace their unique appearances and focus on their personal strengths can help counteract the negative effects of unrealistic beauty standards. By sharing diverse images and stories on social media platforms, we can create a more inclusive online environment that reflects the true variety of human beauty.\nMoreover, educating young people about the harmful effects of the beauty myth and the manipulation of images on social media can help build resilience against the pressure to conform to unrealistic standards. Providing tools for critical thinking and media literacy can empower individuals to navigate the digital landscape with a more discerning eye and a greater understanding of the constructed nature of beauty ideals.\nLastly, advocating for greater transparency and responsibility from social media platforms and the advertising industry can help mitigate the harmful impact of the beauty myth. By holding these entities accountable for the content they promote, we can push for a more ethical and inclusive representation of beauty that reflects the diversity of our society.\nIn summary, applying Naomi Wolf's concept of \"The Beauty Myth\" to social media allows us to better understand the pressure of unrealistic beauty standards and their impact on individuals' self-esteem and mental health. By acknowledging the oppressive nature of these standards and the role of social media in perpetuating them, we can work towards dismantling the structures that support the beauty myth and create a more inclusive and diverse understanding of beauty. By doing so, we can foster a more equitable society that values and celebrates the uniqueness of every individual.",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\nMarch 26th, 2021\nGraded Essay #4\nYears of inequality has created a divide in America\u2019s social classes. The American working class is relatively powerless in a county that prides itself on its history of pluralism and elections. In \u201cThe Class-Domination Theory of Power\u201d by G. William Domhoff and Chapter 4 (Equality) of \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d by Yoval Noah Harari, connect the idea that the weakness of the American working class is a potential reason of an enlarged rift between classes. \nDomhoff states that the weakness of the working class began during the Industrial Revolution, when the black/white split between the working class was reinforced, causing conflicts between \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201cunskilled\u201d workers. These workers had no luck organizing themselves through unions, employees had no power unlike their employers who had great influence with politicians. The history of internal division, political frustration and union defeat caused American workers to continue their individualistic ideology. This left the working class with very little social power unless they were a part of the power of elite. Harari shares similar ideology, he believes that the industrial revolution created industrial economies that relied on masses of common workers. The history of the twentieth century revolved to a large extent around the reduction of inequality between classes, races, and genders. Although, the weakness of the working class is the reason that the gap of inequality has grown between social classes. There are signs of growing inequality both between and within societies. Today, the richest 1 percent own half the world\u2019s wealth, and the richest one hundred people together own more than the poorest four billion.\nBoth Domhoff and Harari could both agree that the working class fuels the power of elite. The 21st century might cause the most unequal societies in history. Just as Americans unify themselves, they begin to separate themselves from each other once again. \n \n \n",

When total fear is brought upon a select few then projected onto the whole country by them, everyone is taught to be scared of whatever the fear is coming from. This is not to take away from the tragedy of these attacks, but to merely put them in perspective. With technology having as big of a presence in society today, word, video, and feelings spread much more quickly than ever before. With the 9/11 attacks being publicly broadcasted on as many news channels as you can think of, this feeling of fear and sorrow was brought upon the whole country in almost the snap of 2 fingers. And now with the collective conscious feeling of fear/sorrow from any mention of terrorism, anyone that disagrees would be looked at as crazy.",

        "text": "Social Media and its influence on Online Social Selves \n\nToday, social media has strong influences on a person's online social self. Young adults are highly impacted by social networking sites. People can change or update their personalities to create friendships. Social media provides an outlet for people to illustrate themselves by self-presentation. Social media users then manifest their identities to join other communities to increase their sociality. Although, we begin to wonder how someone's online social self may differentiate from their offline social self. Also, how social media effects ourselves and manipulates our personality. Do we create our own identity or are we influenced by social media? Throughout this paper, I will cover multiple concepts that connect the idea that social media plays a crucial role in developing our online social self. \nIn class, we studied Cooley and Mead\u2019s argument of social self. Coming to a mutual conclusion that a man's self is the sum total of what he can call his own. Things such as body, clothes, house, friends and family. Man can have multiple social selves, as there are individuals who recognize him and carry a certain image of him in their mind.  We create different social selves because we associate ourselves with multiple groups, and man\u2019s social self is made by the recognition he receives in those groups. We divide up ourselves in all sorts of different selves with reference to our acquaintances, the social process itself is responsible for the appearances of oneself. Therefore, we can argue that social networking sites are partially responsible for the creation of an online social self throughout multiple groups. We being to dive into the social media that allows us to create our online personality. \nFirstly, we will begin discussing how selfies operate as a ubiquitous mode of sociality. (Cambre 2019).  Media and mobile culture often present social media and selfies which then allow active self-creation. We may take selfies for control, to be visible/invisible or just for fun. The practices of \u201cselfie culture\u201d, which consist of posting and receiving selfies, allows us to receive affirmation from others and builds our self-esteem. Overtime replacing old selfies with new ones allows us to create a new social identity. Keeping up with the social stigma makes people believe they must look a certain way over social media in order to develop relationships with new friends and communities. \u201cAs such, pictures of the self are understood as the self but also illustrate how personal identity is increasingly rooted in commodifying and objectifying epistemologies. Narrative forms of identity stressing how the self is continuously rewritten and revised within a dialectics of continuity and rupture seem displaced by the selfie\u201d (Cambre 2019). Social media post such as selfies are the beginning of what influences us to keep up with the most present stigma. It is the foundation of developing one's own social self over social media. Next, we consider how our offline self-impacts our online identity.\nIn the last few years, the internet has become one of the prime places for social interaction among peers. Young adults have a strong need for online socialization, as being offline can sometimes be more difficult. We begin to understand why offline identities influence young people's online interaction, behavioral and cognitive (Helsper 2014). We answer the question, \u201cDoes awareness of certain identity aspects influence how teenagers feel about themselves and act in online environments?\u201d (Helsper 2014). We begin by getting greater background knowledge of how adolescents begin to develop their own identity. Interaction and communication are important to develop at this stage in order to build a social network and create a sense of self. Researchers argue a shift as occurred, and now this stage is being done over the internet (Davis 2012). Teenagers have the need to identify with certain social groups and have strong desires to be romantically involved. This begins the idea of belonging influence, and how teenagers think about themselves and who they interact with. \u201cWhat is clear is that offline personality and identity aspects are used by teens to determine how to present themselves and interact online\u201d (Helsper 2014). \nThe Social Identification and Deindividuation (SIDE) is a framework that argues that social identity influences individual's self-perceptions and behaviors according to social norms (Helsper 2014). SIDE builds upon the self-categorization theory, which supposes that recognizing oneself as a member of a social group depends on the awareness of the group as part of the self. Identification within the group therefore leads to behaviors and self-perceptions to conform to group norms. SIDE frameworks have become an explained link between social identity and online interactions. SIDE often researchers about teen identity development in online interactions, or the content of the interaction in relation to one aspect of identity (mostly gender). There have been experiments about how the prominence of gender, ethnicity and generational aspects are manipulated in an online environment. One experiment consisted of 220 students from 15 secondary schools in the United Kingdom, schools were selected based on the ethnic makeup of their student body (Helsper 2014).  All participants were seated behind their own computer, they could not interact with other students unless it was online. \u201cThe findings presented here suggest that offline social group norms related to gender and ethnic identities influence how teenagers think about themselves in online interactive contexts and that the way in which they are addressed can change the importance of different identity aspect\u201d (Helsper 2014). This confirms that identities influence how teenagers see themselves and the way they act online. Now that we understand that our offline selves develop our online identities, we now dive deeper into how teenagers develop friendships and communities. \nAfter discussing self-presentation and our online identities, we can argue that these two things can create friendship development among young adults. The concepts of media richness, perceived functionality and openness lead to friendship development on social media sites such as Instagram (Lee and Borah 2020). Social networking sites have become an outlet for identity expression amongst teenagers. Instagram, an image sharing, and self-presentation application has attracted more than one billion monthly users and is the fastest growing mobile media, social networking sites around the world. From creating personal profiles and posting videos, photos, liking and commenting has created multiple chances for young adults to manifest their identities. This helps strengthen their need for belongingness to their communities. Instagram gives self-expressive opportunities, and this impacts interpersonal dynamics such as developing friendships. Most studies focus on intrinsic factors such as personality traits. \u201cRegarding self-expression, personality trait of openness has been examined under other media contexts and the trait was found to play an influential role\u201d (Lee and Borah 2020). Openness, for example creating blogs and vlogs, has made attention for the explication of self-presentation on Instagram. Media Richness theory illustrates that media platforms are built on; immediate interaction, cues such as texts, images, symbols and gestures, focus on personal interest, and communication with natural languages. This theory is considered a fitting tool because Instagram works towards visualization, and this enhances natural communication.\nSelf- presentation in social networking sites such as Instagram give users expressive opportunities to contribute to their self-presentational behaviors. Instagram provides new features such as animated stickers and creative fonts which help users better express themselves. Users would perceive Instagram as more functional for self-presentation, and it allows them to be more expressive. This being said, an hypothetical assumption can be made, self-presentation on Instagram is positively related to friendship development (Lee and Borah 2020). Friendship development is one of the most critical forms of social capital that can be created through the self-presentation. We can conclude that perceived media richness, perceived functionality and the personality trait of openness leads to self-presentation, which is positively associated with friendship development. (Lee and Borah 2020). \nCooley and Mead argued that we have multiple social selves depending how others perceive us. Social media platforms allow us to creatively express ourselves, and according to Mead, a person's social self is the recognition which they get from their peers. Social media platforms give people the opportunity to self-present themselves to others. We can use things such as selfies for control and to keep up with social stigmas. We can choose what parts of us we want to make visible and invisible to viewers, or it can be just for fun. We update photos to demonstrate our new social selves to others. Social media post such as selfies are the foundation of self-expression. Then we dived deeper into what creates our online social selves. Young adults have a need for online socialization, and that our identities offline greatly impact the way we act online. Teenagers seem to follow the offline social norms of identity and bring those norms into online scenarios. Personal identities influence teenagers and the way they act online. Then while teenagers utilize social networking sites such as Instagram, three things become a driving factor when developing online friendships. Media richness, openness and perceived functionality. These three concepts are what create self-presentation, which then leads to the development of friendships. It begins with a social media post, such as a selfie. Then it leads to online interactions with others. Lastly, social networking users begin to develop a online social self and begin the develop friendships and create communities. Social networking sites are the reason we have created online social selves. \t\t\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\n\nCambre, Maria-Carolina, and Christine Lavrence. \u201cHow Else Would You Take a Photo? #SelfieAmbivalence.\u201d Cultural Sociology, vol. 13, no. 4, 2019, pp. 503\u2013524., doi:10.1177/1749975519855502.\nhttps://journals-sagepub-com.liblink.uncw.edu/doi/10.1177/1749975519855502\nHelsper, Ellen Johanna. \u201cOffline Social Identity and Online Chat Partner Selection.\u201d Information, Communication & Society, vol. 17, no. 6, 2013, pp. 695\u2013715., doi:10.1080/1369118x.2013.810767.\nhttp://eprints.lse.ac.uk/51116/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_Helsper%2C%20E_Offline%20social%20identity_Helsper_Offline%20social%20identity_2014.pdf\n\nLee, Danielle Ka, and Porismita Borah. \u201cSelf-Presentation on Instagram and Friendship Development among Young Adults: A Moderated Mediation Model of Media Richness, Perceived Functionality, and Openness.\u201d Computers in Human Behavior, vol. 103, 2020, pp. 57\u201366., doi:10.1016/j.chb.2019.09.017.\nhttps://click.endnote.com/viewer?doi=10.1016%2Fj.chb.2019.09.017&token=WzMzMDExMjMsIjEwLjEwMTYvai5jaGIuMjAxOS4wOS4wMTciXQ._YgEdNgFpQYhTrayGUgbyb_y-SY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No group of people has experienced this more than african american women. From being enslaved for being african, directly into having rights very limited just for being a woman, they\u2019ve never had it easy.\n The matrix of domination is essentially an explanation of oppression. This explains how somebody could be being oppressed, while also oppressing someone else. For example, white women were oppressed by white men, but at the same time they would oppress african-americnas. This is brought to attention with afican american women because they never have really been the oppressor; between being oppressed by white people for being african american, and then being oppressed by men for being women. With the three levels of oppression being personal biography, group/community (race, class, gender), and social institutions, african american women were oppressed in nearly all three.\nDue to historical collective consciousness, many groups of people have been oppressed. African american women are among one of the most oppressed groups of people throughout history because of the two main collective consciousnesses against african americans, and against women. The matrix of domination goes into detail about why different groups of people were oppressed and different levels of resistance to this oppression.",

        "text": "\nGoffman\u2019s theory of stage is an analogy in which each individual is merely an actor performing on a stage that represents society. The instant the curtain rises, an actor\u2019s goal is to convince their audience that they are not just playing a character, but rather, that they are the character. The hope is that the audience will react positively to the performance. This is frontstage behavior. When the curtain closes, they are stripped of all falsified identity. Now, the actor is forced to re-enter their reality. They can now engage in backstage behavior, like listening to their favorite song during the commute home. Goffman believed that an individual in society is perfectly represented by an actor on stage. For example, a college student arrives late to class and quietly finds her seat. She is being watched by her peers, or at least she feels like she is, so she quickly attempts to adjust herself to fit in. She usually types notes on her laptop, but when she sees everyone else taking handwritten notes, she quickly decides to pull out her notebook instead. This is an example of frontstage behavior. After class, the student heads back to her dorm to catch up on the notes she missed. There is no longer any external pressure on her to handwrite her notes, so she opens her laptop and begins to type without hesitation. This is an example of backstage behavior. Goffman\u2019s theory of stage outlines the effects of societal pressure concerning an individual\u2019s actions, often guiding the individual to lose sight of their true self in high-pressure settings.\nJames and Goffman\u2019s theories are underscored by the simple idea that humans have an inherent need to be liked. This desire for reassurance is stronger than a genuine sense of self, causing the self to often become overpowered by superficial selves. Individuals, when found amongst peers, are simply projecting a reflection of their understanding of societal expectations. James\u2019 theory of the social self explains the constant stream of information the brain receives from its surroundings to assimilate a temporary self that has the highest chance of being accepted. Goffman\u2019s theory of the stage builds on the social self, as he claims that one\u2019s genuine self will indeed emerge when one feels as if no one is watching. James would refer to the emergence of one\u2019s genuine self as their pure ego. James\u2019 theory of self and Goffman\u2019s theory of stage are merely extensions of one another, best understood when providing each other context.",

There has always been an idea of what a \u201cwoman\u201d should look, talk, think, and act like that changes from one generation to another. With the goalposts of womanhood changing over the course of time and generations, the pressures surrounding and pushing for conformity have to change with the times.  The emergence of social media and the increasing interconnectedness of people to each other has only served to heighten the societal pressure to adhere to the ideas of what a woman is in different situations. This affects fiction in all forms and provides a blueprint for reality and the people in the real world to follow.\n\n Gillian Flynn is a popular fiction writer whose works focus on women's relationships with the beauty myths that surround their roles in their worlds and how that affects them and the people around them. I chose to use two of her novels ``Gone Girl\u201d and \u201cSharp Objects'' as I have a close connection with both pieces. I feel like they demonstrate how the beauty myth is unobtainable in a concrete way and only serves to enforce rules onto women's presence in the world that keep them separate from themselves and their relationships. By changing the goalposts for what a woman is supposed to be, there is no way to \u201cbecome\u201d a woman and then stay one in the eyes of the collective society. It is a never ending push to conform to constantly changing standards and diffrening situations.\n\nThis idea of femininity encompasses every aspect of a person. The film and novel \u201cGone Girl\u201d , has a monologue where the leading woman, Amy Dunne, is talking about what makes up a \u201cCool Girl\u201d , the girl that every guy wants as opposed to the person she actually is when she is by herself;  \u201cCool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.\u201d This idea encompasses what she looks like, how she talks, how she acts, how she thinks, her relationships with men,  and how she lets people treat her. This is the beauty myth under another name and with a different face but it's the beauty myth all the same. The presence of the beauty myth is so strong that it sinks into fiction and for this specific example, is part of the reason Amy sets the events of the novel into motion. \n\nHer resentment for the role she feels she has to play, as the Cool Girl her husband wants her to be in spite of his affair and his increasing poor attitude twords her, leads her to frame her husband for her murder as an act of revenge.  Amy even goes as far to tell her husband at the end of the novel that he made her this way and that he wouldn't have wanted her any other way, she goes on to say she wouldn't be capable of loving if she wasn't exactly the way he made her.  This supports the beauty myth as she not only conformed to the \u201ccool girl\u201d her husband wanted; she was also the dutiful wife, the tragic murder victim, the suffering victim when she returned home, and the scheming women her husband is stuck with out of spousal obligation. The beauty myth rewards women that can perform femininity and the roles each situation provides for them but will punish them for the slightest deviation outside the established lines.\n\nTo further add to the idea that the beauty myth can be used to push the idea that beauty myth is a consequence in fiction, in \u201cSharp Objects\u201d, femininity is rewarded and deviance from the norm is punished. The novel is about Camille Preaker, a conventionally attractive journalist, coming back to her hometown to write about a series of murders of children whose teeth are then removed. Her being seen as a \u201cpretty woman\u201d is used by her to get information she needs about the dead girls and their families for her story and she is shamed when her scars, scars she gave herself that \u201cruin\u201d the idea of what she should look like, are revealed to her romantic interest and her younger half sister, Amma Crellin. Her mother punishes her for having the scars and for her career, as a journalist which is viewed as improper for a woman, in front of Amma, reinforcing the belief to the sister that looks, particularly feminine looks and attitude are everything and are used as bargaining chips in the world. It is shown over the course of the book that all the little girls who were killed were \u201ctomboys\u201d, were known as troublemakers, and all had a history of biting people.\n\n The climax of the book shows that Camille's younger half sister, Amma Crellin, murdered the girls to punish them for being different and taking more of her mothers attention because of their differences. Amma would then remove the girl's teeth to make a marble floor in her dollhouse that was a replica of her own home. She would murder the girls as punishment for not being \u201cgood little girls\u201d, remove their one form of protection, and then use that to play house where Amma was the leading role. Amma used the beauty myth as reasoning for the deaths of these girls, providing severe consequences for inability to conform.\n\nIn Gone Girl, the beauty myth is something that Amy comes to resent  because of how much it affects her life and her relationships. In Sharp Objects, Amma uses the idea of how she should look and behave as a girl as a weapon to harm and kill other girls to punish them. Both stories paint the idea of femininity as a looming presence over women, waiting for a mistake or a slip up, and then punishment of some sort will follow. Obviously the real world is not like this, with murderous little girls and scheming housewives waiting in the wings to punish those who act outside the norms, but there is the presence of what you should look, talk, and act like as a woman always at the back of your mind.  This idea has to come from somewhere and fiction is as good a place as any for this to spring from.\n\nMargaret Atwood is quoted as saying \u201cYou are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.\" That there will always be a person watching you inside of you, judging you based on the standards shown to you as you grow up. I used Sharp Objects and Gone Girl for fictional examples as they are pieces of media I found at a time in my life where I was struggling with the idea of the beauty myth. I was raised in a very strict no makeup, no \u201cgirly\u201d things household where more masculine traits were praised. I remember being jealous of the other girls my age doing ballet when I did martial arts instead. In high school I envied my best friend going out with her boyfriend on the weekends when I was competing in fighting tournaments. I grew up with no idea how to perform femininity the way I say other girls grow into. My mom never taught me how to do my makeup and my dad never gave my boyfriend the \u201cYou hurt my daughter, I hurt you\u201d speech. I felt like I was watching all the girls my age through a glass plane, I could see them but they were totally alien to me. \n\nThen I found Gone Girl, where the main character resents the way she was brought up into the beauty myth with all her heart. Amy hates the idea that she's supposed to be the perfect wife by other people's standards. This was the first time I had seen media that didn\u2019t endorse the perfect little girl idea of the beauty myth. In the second act of the book Amy goes into hiding by cutting her hair poorly, dying it patchy and uneven, and gaining weight. The novel makes a point in saying she enjoys the rebelling against what she was raised to be. That was so shocking to me at the time. Amy did exactly what you're told not to do from a young age as a girl and not only that, she enjoyed it. As the story goes on, Amy's distaste for other women and their conformity to the beauty myth  is shown and her true colors as a person very comfortable with immoral actions that benefit her are brought to light, but seeing a woman deliberately go against the beauty myth so dramatically showed me that there were other options to how I could inhibit the world without necessarily conforming to femininity to the letter.\n\nThe thing that struck me so much about Amy and Camille is that they were allowed to be mean, ugly, and bitter. They resented the people that made them that way and looked out for themselves first. They were not caring or nurturing to anybody but themselves outside of self benefit. They both were so directly opposite to the idea of the loving mother or dutiful girlfriend/wife archetype. They both have goals that directly oppose the leading men of their stories; Amy wants to punish her husband for making her something she doesn\u2019t want to be and Camille wants to find out who the killer is on her own and is at odds with the male detective on the case. At the end of both of their stories, they are both respectively freed from the demands of the idea of femininity by bending the typical roles of women to their own benefit. Amy returns to her husband and is carrying his child, but she makes it clear she is in control of the relationship now and encourages his resentment of her. Camille\u2019s mother is in prison for abusing her and Amma is in prison for murder; freeing Camille from both the bonds of motherhood and daughterhood. This is her breaking away from both roles typically assigned to women in fiction.\n\nBoth novels praise and punish conformity to the beauty myth in about equal measure. Camille is praised for being a good sister but punished for being a bad daughter. Both stories paint pictures of complicated ideas around the beauty myth and being a woman at all. Amy and Camille are bitter and angry but they both are shown to have the capacity to care about others. These stories show that the idea of the beauty myth is inherently flawed, it's never that simple but at the same time, a standard that can ever be reached is not simple. It's damning for whoever tries a lifetime of resentment and anger. \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cSharp Objects\u201d both end with Amy and Camllie rejecting what was laid out for them and changing it to fit them instead. They changed the narrative of their story and how they are seen in that context. I can only hope more fiction follows this idea that rejecting what \u201cshould\u201d happen to a female character bleeds over into real life and helps lessen the stigma around turning your back on what a \u201cwoman\u201d should be, think, do, and say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\nFlynn, Gillian.

        "text": "SOC 105-001 \n10/18/21 \nDo Humans Need Friends to Survive? \nHave you ever thought about the importance of the people in your life? Do you like having lots of friends or just a few quality friends? Do you value human connection in your everyday life? All of these questions establish a human need for contact with others and how that can have an impact on someone\u2019s everyday life. Recognizing that not all human connection is beneficial for you is also important. The way we act around everyone is different and is based upon the setting we are in. This piques the question: are all types of friendships essential for survival, or just some, if any?  \nThere are many arguments for both sides of this topic. Lots of studies have shown the importance of human interactions, while others have shown that you can survive as an independent. Goffman explores the idea of \u201cself\u201d through an analogy of comparing it to a stage. When there are performers on a stage, each of them has a role they play. They all understand their roles and contribute something to the storyline. He believes that depending on who you are with, you will act a certain way. Essentially, each interaction we have is compared to acting or a \u201cshow\u201d we are putting on for an \u201caudience.\u201d The use of \u201cbackstage\u201d is where someone may \u201cprepare\u201d for a \u201cperformance.\u201d This is the analogy he uses to explain how someone may prepare their personality to match how they feel they should act with specific people. This could be based on how the person thinks others think they should act, or what the person has concluded on how they should act based on group or friendship dynamics they have observed. When comparing the self to a stage, it almost makes it sound as though all of our interactions are ingenuine. This leads to the part of Goffman\u2019s theory that says that we are never truly ourselves unless we are alone. \nThat is one side of Goffman\u2019s theory which would make it seem like the people around you do not have any impact on your sense of \u201cself.\u201d However, because you act a certain way in front of others, they are in turn impacting your personality. As humans, we choose how to act in different scenarios based on how we feel as though we should act, not necessarily how we want to act. Awkwardness can occur if someone does not recognize their \u201crole\u201d in a certain group of people. In other words, if you act differently than normal in a situation, it may cause people to be confused or uncomfortable. We all have defined personalities based upon our environment and surroundings. Because making connections with people is important to our ability to navigate the world, friendships and relationships are essential to our survival.  \nPersonally, I feel as though I have many roles in each of my friend groups. While I feel as though I am being \u201cmyself\u201d when I am with each of my close friends, I can see some differences in how I act. It is impossible to act the same way in all settings. I feed off my friends' energies and not all of them have the same energy. It is also based on what \u201croles\u201d need to be filled in each setting or friendship dynamic. For example, I find myself being quieter and observant in some groups, while in other groups I am more outgoing and energetic. Even though I feel comfortable with all of these friends, I have noticed my role in each group leading me to act a certain way. They are all versions of myself that I have modified slightly to fit the energy of who I am with. Being able to fit a \u201crole\u201d in each setting of your life is a skill that humans must learn to be successful.  \nI had never thought about this concept much before learning about how we are never truly ourselves unless we are alone. When we are alone, there is no judgment, no rules, and no outside influences causing us to want to act one way or another. There is no one to react to, therefore, you are completely and utterly \u201cyourself.\u201d No one but yourself can see what is going through your mind or what you are thinking and understand it with the full complexities you can. While this is the true reflection of \u201courselves,\u201d it is not realistic to be able to act this way in front of others. Finding people who make you feel as close to this version of yourself as possible is the best way to measure a friendship.  \nReflecting back on the question about if you need friends to survive or not, I would have never said that you do not need friends to survive. Friends have always been something I value and feel is a necessity in my life. Without human interaction and genuine connection, I feel alone and like I am lacking something. I believe it is part of my personality to surround myself with others and feed off their energies. While this is technically altering my sense of \u201cself,\u201d I do not see it as a negative thing. I see it more as an opportunity to expand my thoughts and gain new opinions and views on topics I might not have seen differently otherwise. \nLooking back at the early ancestors of humans, the great apes, they were not very social. According to the reading from Maryanski and Turner, The Neurology of Religion, adolescent apes would leave their units after puberty, which then placed them with apes that they did not know. No bonds were formed between these apes, leaving them to be more independent. So, how did we go from having low sociality to forming family units with strong bonds? The formation of language was key in this shift. When language was formed, so was the ability to feel emotions and create memories. This connected humans to each other more, and bonds were easier to make. The formation of language made it nearly impossible to not be able to connect to others, as it allowed us to communicate with anyone who spoke the same language as us. Imagine not being able to talk to your friend. How would you be able to know anything about them? How would you be able to know if they like the same things as you? It is harder to form bonds with people when you cannot communicate properly with them. Language also helped form communities of people who come from the same area, have the same interests or values, or who want to learn more about people different from themselves. Language was able to expand the minds of humans and led to great innovation in the world.  \nNowadays, connections are key to making it in society. While our society has shifted to be more independent, you still need to have interactions with people in order to make it as an individual. In order to find a job, you need good social skills to be able to form bonds with employers and get them to hire you. These skills stem from social interactions that take place in our everyday lives. This is a key reason why having friends surrounding you that you feel comfortable with is beneficial. If you are constantly around those that support you, and you feel most closely to your true \u201cself,\u201d these relationships will be beneficial to you.  \nLastly, not only does friendship and bonds help us with social skills and connecting, but it also impacts a part of our brain. Have you ever lost a good friend and been extremely upset by it? Did being reminded of them hurt you and made you think about all the good memories you shared? This is because all the good chemicals in your brain are released when you are with friends. This is what keeps you going back to those relationships you have formed, and what prevents us from hopping around from person to person, without getting to know them. I think most people would say they would rather have a few quality friends over lots of friends that they kind of know. Humans value learning about others and wanting to hear from them. There is such an importance to learning about others and from them. We can take their experiences and apply them to our own and vice versa. Along with our brain releasing chemicals like dopamine and serotonin when we are with friends, friends and social interactions, in general, can also do wonders for our physical and mental health. According to a Fader article, Why We Need Friends, According to a Scientist, people who have friends are less likely to die of heart disease. The article also reveals that having friends around is a big comfort. From personal experience, I would say that that is true. Many times, when I have been in uncomfortable situations, having a friend or friends with me has helped calm my nerves. It is almost like having a barrier there to help break up some of the awkwardness. I know that I can trust them and that they will help me if I need it.  \nOverall, social interactions play a key role in shaping who we are. While you may find yourself in situations where you do not feel like how you are presenting yourself is truly \u201cyou,\u201d it is a version of you that you have created. You can learn from each version of \u201cyou\u201d and apply the reactions you get from your \u201caudiences\u201d to other settings and situations. Having friends and forming connections with people is key to our ability to navigate society and the world. Without bonds, we are just existing as an individual. It is harder to be able to relate to others and find out more about yourself without building social skills and forming friendships with those you feel most comfortable with. Everyone should value the friends and people they have in their lives because they are an opportunity for growth, support, and overall positive physical and mental health.  ",

        "text": "The Significance of Religon\nI thought that temple was extremely boring when I started going. Other than the oneg, which is the part after the service where you get free food, I saw no good reason to be there. It felt like I was just going to sit and listen to someone talk in a different language for an hour and a half. As I kept going, it did not get any more fun, but I did start to observe how everyone that attended seemed very content, and everybody got along with each other quite well. This is the first time I had seen such a large community of people united under a set of moral beliefs that were designed to improve the lives of everyone they touched.\nAfter attending weekly services for a while, the idea of becoming a Bar Mitzvah was introduced to me. I decided I would do it. Mainly, I was interested in the afterparty and the gifts that would come my way as a result. Once I committed to my decision, I started attending Hebrew school on Thursdays and Sunday school on, well, Sundays. Learning Hebrew was the first part of Judaism up to that point that I truly enjoyed. It was fun learning how to read a mysterious-looking language, and there were other kids my age there with me going through the same thing. In Sunday school, I sat with the same kids and learned about the history and principles of the religion. I started to get to know many of the people that I had seen at services and build solid relationships.\n Once I had gotten into this routine of Hebrew school on Thursday, service on Friday, and Sunday school on Sunday, things began to get a little more intense. I began to meet with the Rabbi in my free time. I would go into her office and we would sit for an hour each session and study prayers and readings in Hebrew to prepare for my event. Becoming a Bar Mitzvah almost felt like a job at this point. I remember the Rabbi getting upset with me one time because I was reading the English transliteration of the prayer instead of the Hebrew. I was becoming tired of all the hard work.\nOf course, even more work came on top of this. I was told I needed to complete a Bar Mitzvah project, which is essentially a social action project that encourages students to combine their talents and hobbies with an act of community service. I have played piano for many years, so I decided to play for senior citizens at retirement homes. I figured that this would serve the community well since many people living in these homes did not have the option to go out to events or see live music. While this was a fun thing to do and it felt good to make people happy, it was even more work that I had to do apart from school and other extracurriculars.\nThere was a final aspect of my studying on top of everything else. This was a Hebrew tutor, who helped me learn the prayers I had to learn in between my meeting times with the Rabbi. I knew my tutor personally and we got along very well, so this was also a good time, but again, it was more work that I had to do in preparation for what was once just an idea. It was at this point that I began to ask myself what the point of this was. Who was I doing it for? It was not for my parents, my friends, or my teachers. I never answered this question for myself until months later.\nEmile Durkheim, a French sociologist, explained the idea of the collective consciousness and collective representations. The collective consciousness is the shared values, beliefs, and viewpoints of a group. A collective representation is something that represents the common beliefs and ideals of a society. For example, a collective representation from American society would be the American Flag. The flag is for all Americans and symbolizes the common American belief system and dream. Rather than being individual people leading completely separate lives and completely forming our own beliefs, the collective consciousness gives us an opportunity to have a group to share knowledge with.\nThis is what I realized once I reflected on my experience of becoming a Bar Mitzvah. All of the things I had done to work towards a seemingly pointless goal had done something bigger than I could have imagined. It introduced me to a new community of people to share values and beliefs with. I had not been indoctrinated into a belief system, I had been welcomed into a community. I understood that it was actually preparing me to decide to what extent religious values shared by my community would affect and direct my later life, and realized that decisions I make regarding my involvement and participation in the community are fully voluntary, and should come from a place of genuine care.\nOnce I truly considered these things, everything that had once seemed like a job started to become parts of a whole. The connection to all of these people and ideas that I made through my work bound me to my faith. I now carry the values and lessons I have learned with me and allow them to influence my life and decisions in positive ways. Being a Jew means being part of a unique collective consciousness. A Bar Mitzvah is more than just the rote memorization of various prayers and readings, it is a celebration of an individual taking their place in the community.\nIn conclusion, the true meaning of religion took me a while to understand. From attending temple, to Hebrew school, to Sunday school, to studying prayers and readings, I am grateful for the community that I have become a part of, even if I did not understand what was happening in the moment. I am very close with the people that I got to know through my experiences. Although I only have experience with one religion, I can extrapolate that all religions and belief systems have rituals that may not be understood by outsiders. However, these rituals serve a purpose in bringing a certain group of people together under shared values. It goes even further than religion. This system of shared values happens with entire countries. Being a part of the collective consciousness provides meaning in one\u2019s life.",

On one hand, Gregory Mantsios in his article Class in America reveals how one\u2019s social class influences their experiences and opportunities in life. On the other hand, in George Ritzer\u2019s monograph The McDonaldization of Society, Ritzer describes Max Weber\u2019s ideas of rationalization as a process where the world, especially bureaucracies, becomes based on efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control. Although these writings discuss different conversations, Mantsios and Weber\u2019s ideas can be synthesized to understand funerary services in America. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate how Mantsios\u2019 idea of class and Weber\u2019s idea of rationalization relate to understanding why Americans choose cremation over other funerary services.\n\tIn Mantsios\u2019 article Class in America, he debunked four myths about the American lifestyle: that America is classless, that America is a middle-class nation, that all Americans are getting richer, and that everyone has an equal chance to succeed. Mantsios exposed the falsity of these myths by revealing the lives of three individuals, Harold S. Browning, Bob Farrel, and Cheryl Mitchell, who are all considered middle-class in America. In examining the different lives of these individuals, he revealed that there existed large economic disparities between each of the individuals from the moment they were born that persisted throughout their lives, shaping their experiences and opportunities. Thereby, Mantsios exposed seven realities to American life. To summarize these realities, Mantsios underlines how there are extreme differences in the economic standing of American citizens as the middle class owns a small percentage of the nation's wealth. This disparity affects Americans\u2019 lifestyles, educational opportunities, chance for survival, and success. \n\tAn example of where this economic disparity affects American lifestyles is when an American is selecting a funerary service for themselves or their loved ones. Relating to Mantsios\u2019 myths and realities of the American social classes, Mantsios exposes how although the United States is not a country of equal opportunity, Americans still embrace the American dream, which he represented through the myths of American social class. Pertaining to funeral services, there exists a myth about funeral services, which can be showcased in American movies. Once a character dies in a movie, they are depicted lying in an open casket with guests and family lined up in front of the casket weeping and dressed in all black. In reality, most Americans do not hold funerals as 59% of Americans who died in 2022 were cremated according to the Cremation Association of North America (\u201cIndustry Statistical Information\u201d). Around 41% of those Americans chose to do a direct cremation (\u201cWhat the Latest Stats\u201d), which is when an individual is cremated without a memorial service, making it the most cost-effective funerary service. Furthermore, this cremation rate is expected to reach 80% by 2045. This increase in cremation rates is largely due to America's inability to afford funerals. However, other reasons come into play for some Americans, such as environmental concerns about casket burials or preference (\u201cU.S. Cremation Rate\u201d). A survey of 1,500 Americans run by Anthony Martin in 2021 found that \u201c73% of respondents don't have enough money set aside to cover the cost of the average funeral\u201d (Martin). In regards to Mantsios\u2019 ideas of class and economic differences in America, these statistics about cremation rates reveal that most Americans do not have the opportunity to have an open casket funeral or memorial service to celebrate the death of their loved ones. Thereby, the myth of the American dream depicted in movies of grandiose funeral services is debunked by the reality that most Americans cannot afford it. As Mantsios states, Americans' economic disparity is increasing and their wealth is largely dependent on the social class they are born into. This helps to highlight why there is an expected increase in dead cremated in forthcoming years. Ultimately, Mantsios\u2019 ideas of economic disparity between social classes in America can be observed through American's choice of funerary services as most Americans are cremated because it is the least costly funerary service.\n\tFurthermore, Mantsios\u2019 ideas of economic disparity between social classes in funerary services can be further observed by its relation to Weber\u2019s idea of rationalization. In Ritzer\u2019s monograph The McDonaldization of Society, he describes Weber\u2019s idea of rationalization as the shift in how institutions are built, focussing on efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control, which is done in bureaucracies and Ritzer\u2019s McDonaldization. This shift from pre-modern institutions to modern institutions changes the focus of the institutions from acting out of social meaning to acting out of social purpose. Institutions that act out of social meaning prioritize a symbolic shift and collective understandings, such as transformative baptism in churches to represent religious values. On the other hand, institutions that act out of social purpose prioritize accomplishing a purposeful, collective task, such as exchanging money to purchase goods in banks. This shift in rationalization gets rid of spontaneous interactions; replaces traditions, values, and emotions; and causes individuals, such as consumers and employees to be allowed few choices to their means to an end. These effects of rationalization are often dehumanizing for people affected by it, expressing Weber\u2019s idea of the \u201ciron cage.\u201d \n\tAs highlighted above in funerary services, cremation is the most cost-effective funerary service. This is because the process of cremation exhibits the characteristics of Weber\u2019s rationalization: efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control. Cremation is an efficient process because it takes between an hour and a half to two hours for a body to get cremated while funeral service takes long hours of planning and executing; cremation is predictable as the outcome, receiving a loved one\u2019s ashes, is guaranteed; cremation is calculable as the service is relatively cheap with a relatively constant cost everywhere unless an individual wants a memorial service with the cremation, which increases the cost; and cremation is controlled as it primarily only needs a cremation chamber to conduct and is primarily the only choice for most Americans as the only affordable option. Although the cremation process is efficient, predictable, calculable, and controlled, it faces the problems of dehumanization explained in Weber\u2019s idea of the iron cage. As most Americans get cremated without a memorial service, the tradition of a funeral, the value of celebrating a person\u2019s death, and the emotions of grief and acceptance that result from traditional funerary services have to be experienced in different manners, which result from the cremation being the only means to an end for most Americans. All in all, cremation exhibits the characteristics of rationalization through its efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control, which in turn causes it to become an iron cage as it is the only affordable option for most Americans. \n\tUltimately, Mantsios\u2019 ideas of social class in America and Weber\u2019s ideas of rationalization can be synthesized to understand why most Americans choose cremation over other funerary services. This is due to the fact that cremation is the only affordable or cost-effective funerary service because it exhibits the characteristics of Weber\u2019s rationalization, which in turn becomes the only option for most Americans because of the economic disparity between social classes in America as explained by Mantsios. It is important to understand this connection between Mantsios\u2019 and Weber\u2019s ideas because it underlines the dehumanizing nature of cremation when Americans cannot afford the expected funeral service depicted in movies, expressing the American dream or myth of funerary services.\n\nWorks Cited\n\u201cIndustry Statistical Information.\u201d Cremation Association of North America, https://www.cremationassociation.org/industrystatistics.html.

        "text": "America has an unspoken, unacknowledged class system. With the one percenters owning most of the wealth in America, there\u2019s not much for anyone else. The middle class system splits a portion of the rest of the wealth and the working class divvy up the rest. With artificial intelligence (ai) becoming more and more advanced what does this mean for everyone?\n\tIn today's society we are seeing AI be advanced at faster rates than ever before. This is due to the one percenters seeing more and more potential for revenue through them. But the trade offs for this start with having working class citizens losing their jobs to technology and are making everyone much more lazy. With self driving cars on the rise, people aren\u2019t even going to have to drive themselves where they need to go. This is good in terms of less risk to the passengers because of the vehicles being a part of the same algorithm and having much less chance for miscommunication. The downside to this is people not seeing how much technology is taking over our lives. It\u2019s projected that by 2050 computers will be able outperform human psychiatrists and even bodyguards.\n\tWith AI advancing at unacknowledged fast rates this could be the downfall to the class system in America. People need to acknowledge what is happening with technology and/or find alternative ways for people and technology to thrive together. Also, with technology becoming more and more accessible we should be utilizing this to eliminate the class system throughout America.",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\nOctober 18, 2021\nFirst Reflection Essay: Women are \u201cOther\u201d\n\tA popular concept throughout history is that men are stronger, smarter, and simply better than women, and that women are just a lesser subcategory of men. Some may argue that this is because men are more genetically superior as men do not suffer from periods or pregnancy, while others may argue that men are supposed to be in control because that is how God intended it to be. Due to this unfortunate bias, women have always been separated from men and labeled as \u201cother.\u201d While we are all human, gender has divided us into 2 groups, lesser and superior; the One and the Other.\nThe truth is men are not superior to women. While men may be better at some things than women, men and women are equally capable of doing most things. This can be intimidating and threatening to men because they have always considered themselves the superior gender. While we are approaching a more equitable society, sexism and misogyny are complex issues that will certainly not be resolved in the near future. Due to this slow progression, women will remain the other in the eyes of some men and suffer because of it.\nIn \u201cWomen as Other\u201d by Simone de Beauvoir, she poses a theory about how women are presented as \u201cother\u201d and men are the main idea and self. An example would be two separate village tribes each thinking of themselves as the main tribe and the other tribe as the \u201cothers.\u201d She starts off by saying, \u201cIf I want to define myself, I first have to say, \u2018I am a woman\u2019; all other assertions will arise from this basic truth.\u201d Gender is an essential part of human identity. Once you are confident about your gender identity, your inner, true self will become more clearly revealed to yourself and the world. Men do not have to navigate the world as men, the world has already been carved out for them to insert themselves into. Women on the other hand have to forge their own paths because not only do they have to prove themselves in their abilities but they also have to prove their worth. \nBeauvoir also claims that \u201cWomen are the negative, to such a point that any determination is imputed to her as a limitation, without reciprocity.\u201d By saying this, it is implied that women are not really a positive, contributive part of a society. Any aspirations that a woman has will be ignored or negatively received and will not be reciprocated by men. A woman\u2019s determination and ambition is considered to be a handicap. We can see this is the real world when certain women are reprimanded for their confidence and accomplishments, while men doing the same tasks are awarded and praised.\nWith the topic of women as \u201cother\u201d arises the question \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d In early history it seems that men had chosen that they were to be the dominant ones and women just decided to follow. But why and how did men decide this? They viewed women\u2019s bodies as a complex, disturbing system. Eve was made from Adam\u2019s rib and she became a subcategory of man; an incomplete man. Even the famous ancient philosopher Aristotle said that \u201cWe should regard women\u2019s nature as suffering from natural defectiveness.\u201d It is human nature to fear the unknown, therefore it is understandable that men would form their societies around subjugating women rather than give up their advantage and appear weak. \nTo put it in more simple terms, men are afraid of what they do not understand. With this fear comes a need for power to control the unknown and resilient nature of women. The problem with that idea is women were not really made to be controlled. Women are free thinkers with brilliant ideas. Beauvoir talks about how men will tell her \u201cYou think such and such a thing because you\u2019re a woman\u201d and the only reply she can think of is \u201cI think it because it is true.\u201d  This is an example of men separating themselves from women and classifying them as \u201cother\u201d. In a man\u2019s head he is right because he is superior and will not allow a woman to go against him or prove him wrong. \nThe whole point of othering is to dehumanize another group to make yourself or the group you belong to seem more appealing. This othering has taken many different forms throughout history. For one, the concept of marriage seems, on the surface, to be an act of partnership and love. However, marriage often confines women to predetermined roles rather than allowing them to choose their own. Certain marital traditions are used to obtain women\u2019s power and submission. For example, when a woman marries a man, she takes his last name which essentially means she becomes part of his identity and erases a little of her own. It is presented as unity but symbolizes control.\nIn the past, a woman's responsibilities included cleaning, housemaking, child rearing, educating children, etc. Men would go to work while women would stay home to watch the kids, clean the house, do the laundry and cook dinner for the husbands when they got home. About a hundred years ago, women began fighting to become more than that. They wanted to be part of the workforce and make their own money. Of course, this threatened men. If women were making their own money and providing for themselves, why would they need to rely on men any longer? To appease women they allowed them to work, but the jobs weren\u2019t as legitimate as mens. They were receptionists for a company run by men or sewed clothes for a company run by men. By doing this, men believed they were in control by \u201cletting\u201d women work but they were also able to keep their power.\nWhile the majority of the workforce is dominated by men, one industry that has almost always been dominated by women is education. When schools in the United States began to be established, the teachers used to be all men who did not really know how to teach, they were just intelligent. Because of this, men did not make very good teachers for young children. As public schooling became a more widespread idea throughout the country, the need for teachers and school staff increased. Women were brought in as teachers not just because it was considered a lesser field, but because they put affection over reason. This is very important when dealing with developing minds because children need to be nurtured in order to learn and grow properly. And so, the feminization of teaching developed and prospered. Women dominating the education field seems to imply that women are in fact superior to men at teaching. But if women are \u201cother\u201d how can they be better than men at something? \nIt is because while women may be \u201cother\u201d it should not be in a negative connotation. Being outcasted by men has brought women together to form a sisterhood. They look out for each other by walking home in groups, comforting each other when they are upset, and lending strangers tampons. Women have to stick together because it still is a male dominant world. Men make decisions and laws on women\u2019s bodies, controlling what they can and cannot do with them. There is a saying that \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and it is a terrifying saying. It is used to excuse male actions, including violence against women. Women understand the fear of not being believed and believe in each other. The female gender has always come together and fight for what is just for them, whether it\u2019s the right to vote or the #MeToo movement.\nIn \u201cWomen as Other\u201d, Beauvoir also says that \u201cWomen\u2019s actions have never been more than a symbolic agitation; they have won only what men have been willing to concede to them; women have taken nothing; they have only received.\u201d In this she means that women only really have what has been given to them by men. That men are the ultimate decision makers in women's lives. But with what they have been given they have redefined and improved. They stand up for what they believe in, defend one another, and challenge what is unjust. Women\u2019s actions are no longer just a symbolic agitation.\n\tTo be a woman is to be \u201cother\u201d, but to be a woman is not to be an outcast. Women understand each other because they share the same experiences. By othering women, men simply created a united front who stand up for and support each other. As each year passes and humanity progresses, there are more and more victories for women's rights. But, if men and women ever do achieve absolute equality, women will still be different. Being a woman is an experience and it is shared between women all over the world. Womanhood is an essential intimacy. Women are other, not because they are lesser, but because they are connected.",

        "text": "3222\nWhat We See in Ourselves\n\tGoffman offers \u201cThe Presentation of Self\u201d and draws upon the stage to describe oneself. He uses this stage to create a comparison between an actor in a play to the conscious creation of one\u2019s personality towards others. Goffman states, \u201cA correctly staged and performed scene leads the audience to impute a self to a performed character, but in this imputation\u2014this self\u2014is a product of a scene that comes off, and is not a cause of it.\u201d Goffman uses this evidence to elaborate on how the self that others see is more or less the product of an act. He goes on to mention that the way we conduct ourselves in front of others is purely for the conformity of those others. The stage creates a movement that can be discredited as easily as it can be credited. This is in pure contrast to the way we live, think, and breathe. We are one, singular, living being. However, the actions we choose to take within social settings are forged in the moment to suit the conditions of those around us. This, in turn, creates the act to which Goffman refers.\n\tCooley and Goffman both draw on the basic fact that humans, truly and subconsciously, care what others think. This idea is in direct tandem with the passages from both authors. The looking glass self is an idea established on assuming what others think, while the stage is the action of changing the way you act around others to suit what they think of you. Afterall, it would take a thorough analysis of how you are seen in order to act properly. Let\u2019s say, for example, you go to your significant other\u2019s house for a dinner, and the father is constantly looking at you with furrowed eyebrows. This, in one\u2019s mind, might generate an uneasy feeling. It would be clear to see that the father does not like you. This reaction may involve you bringing up possible real-world achievements. Maybe you might mention that you are pursuing a medical degree to impress him. You will use better manners at the table. These are prime examples of both the looking glass self and Goffman\u2019s stage. You are assuming the way the father is perceiving you, even though he hasn\u2019t actually said anything about not liking you. You are also changing your act, civility, and speech patterns based on your lack of comfort around this individual.\n\tBoth Goffman and Cooley work hand-in-hand to show how individuals change the way they act around others based on how they are viewed. These authors are highly effective in their views because they directly build upon each other. Cooley proposes the original view of others, while Goffman proposes the way we shape ourselves to correlate to these viewpoints. This is why we feel certain emotions towards how others view us, and it is why we try to adhere to or correct those emotions in the real world. Both Goffman and Cooley essentially display that the way we act is not truly the way we are, since we live in a world of constant judgement. Any action may be seen by others as positive or negative, and subsequently corrected or embraced.",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n11/28/2021\n\nReligion, Cultural Development, and Dehumanization Through the Military Industrial Complex: Second Reflection Essay\n\n\tThe book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari covers a number of topics ranging from the role of religion in society to the future of war in the modern age. This also lines up with a number of other readings from this sociology course such as Estranged Labor by Karl Marx and The Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber. However there are differences and similarities between how these three authors view the world and this allows their work to be looked at critically and analyzed. \nReligion exists, as posited by Harari, as a framework humans have made to give meaning to the world and their choices. Morality has evolved to fit in the framework religion has been created around. By following this logic, the only place religion has in policy is in its spirit of unity. He states that human nature is to come together one way or another, religion is an extension of that. Therefore, the religion of a region is built on the preexisting cultural norms and ideas, creating different religions and value systems by location. By bringing people together under a fairly consistent moral framework, it serves its purpose that way. In short, this idea states that religion serves people first and foremost and varies based on the cultures of the area. For example, Buddhism and Catholicism are vastly different, in part based on where they were developed and in part based on the cultures they originated around. This is a key facet of Harari\u2019s ideas about religion, it exists to serve the people within it, not the other way around. \nReligious faith was often a key reason people and groups immigrated to America in the first place as England was rife with religious discrimination against any kind of dissent from the established norms. Protestantism was an offshoot of the practiced Christanity in England at the time that was being punished for stepping outside the norms for religious practice. This led to many people who followed this way of life to immigrate to America in the hopes of religious freedom and a fresh start. \nWeber argued that the Protestant work ethic was a very solid base for the rise of capitalism in the west with the presence of the Protestant work ethic. The idea that having to work very hard to earn a place in the society and furthermore Heaven was a grounding point in the Protasnat faith. Weber states that having this framework built so heavily into the Western society with early Pilgrim settlers bringing their faith to the colonies with them and building their new world with these ideas almost baked in. From this base, as time progressed and technology increased this religious belief was taken for granted as part of the American fabric of life. \nThe conflict here between both arguments is the nature of what religion is used for and how it comes to be. Weber states that the groundwork laid by the existence of Protatasmt, modern day capitalism was able to grow and thrive in the West. Harari argues that religion is created to serve the people who create it as a point of unity. While it can be said that the settlers that came to America were united under the idea of having religious freedom in the new world, there were strict dividing lines between religious groups of all sorts, sometimes even within the same religious groups. Furthermore capitalism developed in various ways and at various places all over the world. There is almost no way to argue that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the Protastant background of America is what allowed modern day capitalism to spring up the way it has. \nMarx argues that in modern day capitalism products made by the laborer don't belong to the laborer. They work on an assembly line for 16 hours a day but the end products belong to the boss of the factory or the government at large. This separates the worker from their labor and their products. This product is now completely separate from the worker and what made it. This leads to the dehumanization of the person through the denial of the human capacity for conscious production. As industrialization becomes more and more complex and infiltrates every aspect of human life, particularly in a political and social sense, this sense of dehumanization will spread to every aspect of the human condition.\nIndustrialization has had leaps and bounds over the past few centuries as advancements compound on each other. The steam engine opened up trade in new and exciting ways, which brought in more resources, which allowed for more advancement and so on and so forth. One of the biggest pushes for advancement has always been war and the drive to be the best in the world at war. In the past, war was more about how many bodies could be thrown at a problem, which is its own kind of dehumanization, but as time advances the roles the individual can take in the framework of a society at war have changed and opened up new avenues for duminization within the framework of capitalism.\nThe idea of what the roles that should be filled in society change over time. The cultural consciousness has always dictated the roles of the individuals within the society: based on race, gender, age, and class standing. During the past, military enlistment was a point of pride. During World War 2, almost every aspect of American individual life revolved around the war and the war effort. If the individual did not serve, they were expected to provide for the war effort in some way, such as working on the factory line. The people who did not fit within this were considered outsiders and not part of the social fabric.\nHarari states that the previous idea of war for profit is no longer financially viable in the modern day and age, that the wars of the future are being fought in more abstract ways than outright battlefields and trenches. The wars of the future are increasingly being fought over cyber security, technological advancements, and over resources with increasing scarcity. In turn instead of being pushed towards military service, more and more people are being pushed to higher education and jobs in the private sector. \nAccording to the Department of Defense only about 2% of the 20.6 17-21 years olds are even capable of enlisting to serve. ( Bloomberg.com, Bloomberg, 12 July 2021 ) However College enrollment rates have increased 195% since 1970, when 3.5% of the U.S. population were college students. ( Education Data Initiative, 22 Nov. 2021,) This is adding further to Harai\u2019s point that the future wars are going to be fought in the realm of technology as time passes. \nNovels such as Ender's Game, Ready Player One, and The Ghost Fleet are recommended reading for enlisted members of the Marine Corps of all ranks. (\u201cCommandant's Professional Reading List (Foundational).\u201d MCA, 3 June 2021,)  These novels are all written about futures where wars are fought in the realms of technology and over resources, with a focus on how the idea of wars being physically fought has too much of a physical cost or this cost being completely negated by being capable of fighting the entire war from the comfort of your own country, further adding to Hararis point that the direction of future war is going to be more and more impersonal as technology advances what we can do from the safety of our own homes. These fictional wars all illustrate the point within the text that the people involved are largely superfluous. In most of these stories, a point is made to show that at the end of the story, the individual's choices were laid out within a framework that did not allow for much choice on their end. They were acting out a script, without being aware of what their actions cost, separating them from their labor. The message is as war further develops, the dehumanization brought to the individual under capitalism has no choice but to spread to other aspects of the human experience, taking away other freedoms to express human desires, regelaging the indivdal to express aminal desires instead. \n\tIn conclusion, Harai\u2019s work covers a number of topics with a level of grace applied to them. He posits that religion exists to serve the people within it, not the other way around and that modern day wars will be fought in the realms of technology rather than in the physical world. Max Weber argued that within the foundations of the Protastant in America, modern day capitalism would not have the same spread and hold on the world today that it does now. This is somewhat at odds with what Harari says about religion and what its role within a society is and should be. On the other hand,  Karl Marx talks about how the modern industrialization of labor serves to dehumanize the people within the system, this lines up with what Harari writes about modern war and the wars of the future. \n\n\n\n\nCitations\nAllen, Kieran.

        "text": "SOC 105\nFebruary 12, 2021\nGender Concept\n\nA western concept known as \u201cgender binary\u201d claims that there are only two gender options; male or female. It is also believed in some collective groups that sex and gender are the same, but in sociological terms they are very different. Sex is assigned at birth from the appearance of Gentelia while gender is a role. West Zimmerman argues that both gender role and display focus on behavioral aspects of being a woman or a man, not biological aspects. \nIt has been perceived that \u201cmen are men and women are women\u201d, to be natural and rooted to biology, which over time has produced psychological, behavioral and social consequences. Now it is commonly believed that gender has to act a certain way. Gender roles are situated identities, but many roles are already gender marked. For example, nurses have been identified with a female role. In the short story The Yellow Wallpaper, written by Charolotte Perkins Gilman, the wife is trapped inside of her mind. She believes she is ill, although her husband (a physician) does not believe her. Her husband tells her not to speak of her problems, saying that it will make her \u201cfeel worse\u201d.  They are playing a doctor, patient role instead of the role of husband and wife. Because of her gender, she is treated unequally. As the husband he is taught to act masculine and controlling, and the wife has to act as the submissive. Gender has been created to be this social expectation, but in reality, gender role can be anything we want it to be.\nThe concept of gender is a socially learned set of behaviors associated with assignment. Gender does not have to correlate to the sex stereotype. Men don\u2019t have to masculine, and women don\u2019t have to be feminine. Gender is a choice developed by different groups of the collective consciousness. \n",

        "text": "3222\n\nThe Discrimination of Class\n\n\tEconomic class is a systemic hierarchy within America that determines a citizen\u2019s power status. In \u201cClass in America,\u201d Gregory Mantsios addresses concerns regarding inequality the system promotes. In \u201cDiscrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market: a Field Experiment,\u201d authors Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski address an experiment led to detect discrimination in the modern workforce. All these authors cohesively present evidence that addresses the concerns of racial bias throughout the classes of America.\n\tGregory Mantsios writes of his findings revolving around an experiment conducted between families of different financial standings. In the result of the preceding experiments, Mantsios notes that there is a direct correlation between high school students\u2019 SAT scores and the wealth of their parents. This finding exhibits the context of control. Those who have more money are more likely to be able to afford a solution to the problems of their children\u2019s educations. The parents who were more likely to find value in their children\u2019s educations, likely to uphold the image of being considered \u201cbetter\u201d than the general public, were the ones to impart those shared values to their children.\n\tThe discrimination experiment, on the other hand, was conducted to show the difference between an employer\u2019s biases based on race. In the experiment, a group of several men with no outstanding qualifications than the others involved. These men all had impressive backgrounds, all with the same skills and qualifications. The results showed that the white men were far more likely to get a call back from the interviewers. This result showed the basis of race in America and how employers will, even unconsciously, rely on predetermined bias to make decisions.\n\tBoth these sources detail a system of inequality in the United States, though these sources work in tandem to illustrate the inequality of race in modern working America. Those who maintain the working, middle class in America are seen as those who work. The American ideals lead to the belief that hard work can lead one to the top. While this idea may or may not lead to a system of power, the discrimination experiment shows that those of minority races are less likely to be hired for working positions by employers. This result, coupled with the fact that power is distributed to those of higher economic status, insists that minorities are far less likely to hold positions of American power.\n\tIn the modern United States, black Americans have essentially been forced to live in poor areas and living conditions. Since Mantsios elaborates on correlating wealth and SAT scores, black Americans living poor lifestyles are less likely to get a high score on the SAT. This, in turn, leads to a lack of college acceptance and future jobs. Black Americans are dealt a lower likelihood to advance to a position of power in the United States. This position of power, naturally, is one based off economic wealth, with the power elite being the richest in America.\n\tIn my experience, I come from a well-off household, on the upper end of the middle class. I was taught the values of hard work and professionalism from a very young age by my father, who held and maintained a job in a stable, professional working environment. These values were instilled in me because it is what my father deemed important enough to pass to me. While in his position, he clearly held the wish for me to do the same in the future. This carried on to me, as I am pursuing a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. My friend, Justin, on the other hand, was raised in a considerably poor household. His parents came from Mexico and then started a life of hard work. This hard work meant little because they didn\u2019t have an American education, nor could they speak perfect English. His mother was a nurse and worked long hours just to make ends meet.\n\tI went to high school with Justin, and I asked him what job he wanted to do when he graduated college. He told me that college was not part of his plans. He intended to get out of high school and work hard for the rest of his life because that is what he knows. When it comes to my father, there is much more than hard work. He knows how to talk to people, how to propose new ideas, and how to cater towards other white males\u2019 interests. From this perspective, it is very easy to see how the white male is set up for more success, being taught the values of other white males, which then get passed to newer generations. This act assists in the matter of keeping less wealthy minorities, what deBeauvoir would deem as the \u201cother,\u201d out of any positions of power and financial standing.\n\tEach of the authors proposed above uses their corresponding experiments to prove that American minorities are withheld from positions of economic power. While minorities tend to maintain positions of lower finances, the values of hard work are taught to their children. This, coupled with the results of the discrimination experiment, proves a difficult concept. The reason is this: minorities maintain the instilled values of hard work, but not that of appealing to the white man. Starting a business is not always the best option, so working to the top is more likely the method to success. How can minorities make their way to the top when employers refuse to hire them? Hard work means little when you are denied any opportunity to show it, maintaining the reason that there is a distinct correlation between minorities and lower economic American classes.",

        "text": "0268\nEquality Within Businesses\nIs there equality between races within businesses? Automatically, it is thought that there is equality between races because all races now live together in society, but in reality, true equality has not been accomplished. Within society people create stereotypes of black people, assuming they are bad based on the color of their skin. Instead of getting to know a person and judging them based on their personality, people often get judged by how they look. This is because in the past black people were considered to be less than white people because of their skin color and this idea has continued to be passed down even though there is \u201cequality\u201d in today's world. Black people tend to have to work a lot harder than white people to get a job and even when they do it is common for them to be put in a position where they will not be seen by the public and it is not necessarily a good job. \nWithin my small, predominantly white, hometown I have worked at two different restaurants that are both very popular. The first restaurant is on the water, which people would often go to after a boat day. At this job, I worked as a hostess and a food runner. It was a very common place for high schoolers to work and needed many different people as servers, barbacks, and more. After I had applied, I told my friend, who is black, to apply as well because he has a good work ethic and social skills. When I told my boss about him, she said that they needed more servers, and he would most definitely get the job. However, when he came for his in-person interview, my boss told him that they did not have any space for him, and he could not have the job. I had asked my boss why he did not receive the job and she responded saying \u201che was not the right person to be a server\u201d which did not make a lot of sense considering he had the skills for it. Later on in the year I had noticed that she went on to give many people jobs as servers and hosts, but all of them were white. However, back in the kitchen where customers were not able to go, all of the chefs and dishwashers were black. \nThe second place where I started to work was a country club. I started to notice the same trend of events, but worse. Within my first week there, I realized that all the kitchen staff and people that worked in the back were black. I was told by someone that had worked there longer than me that black people had applied to be servers but were told they were not the right fit for the job. One of the guys that worked in the kitchen came and welcomed me and told me if I had questions, he would be happy to help me out. A few of my coworkers had noticed and came up to me and told me to stay away from him and that he was bad. For them to say something like this led me to ask them why they had thought he was \u2018bad\u2019, and their answer was \u201che came from the hood which makes him bad\u201d. The \u2018hood\u2019 in my town is the black community that everyone says to stay away from when in reality nothing bad has ever happened there. Even though he had never given my coworkers a reason to think he was bad, they were very quick to assume something about him because of where he came from.\nAfter experiencing situations like this firsthand, I started to pay attention when eating at different restaurants. Within my hometown, there is not one restaurant that has a black server besides for the McDonalds. Most black people that work in a restaurant, are given a job of making food for someone else or cleaning up other people's messes. From some people\u2019s point of view, these are jobs that are considered to be more appropriate for specific races. They are given jobs with less pay and where they are not noticed by customers. \nWithin the Pager Discrimination Study, Devah Pager did research on whether discrimination plays a role within a low-wage labor market. To find the answer, Pager used an experimental research method by sending out different races with equal resumes to find a job. Through the experiment, it was found that there are different discrimination mechanisms used by employers. The first mechanism is categorical exclusions which is when someone is not hired because of their race. The next is shifting standards which require a more intense interview based on someone\u2019s race. Lastly, job channeling is when someone gets hired but is given a job that is considered to be more appropriate for their race. It is less likely for a minority to get a job because they are seen as unreliable, dishonest, or lacking social abilities causing them to have to try a lot harder than white people. \nFor a very long time, it has been a common occurrence for black people to be judged based on how they look. These judgments are often poor and tend to degrade black people. They are seen as bad people because of their skin tone. It is not common for a black person to be judged based on who they are. It is more common for them to be judged by how they look and where they come from.\nBoth of the restaurants where I have worked have discriminated towards black people.  Almost everyone on the staff was white and the bosses were older and still had certain beliefs that would not normally be accepted in today's society. The first and second restaurant partook in job channeling. Many people who had applied for a job there got the job that they had originally applied for, as long as they were white. On the other hand, when a black person had applied, they were automatically given a job that was more suitable for them. Those who worked in the kitchen where they were not visible to the public were placed in positions that the employer felt best fit them. Not only did they represent job channeling, but they also represented categorical exclusion. When a black person had applied for an open job, they were not given it because of how they looked. This is not an issue that only occurred within those restaurants, it is something that happens everywhere.\nEquality is something that everyone would like to believe in, but after many years there still does not seem to truly exist. Through my experiences within businesses, I have realized that there is still discrimination and both races are not treated equally because people are often quick to judge. Even though true equality has not yet been achieved, that does not mean it cannot. It is important for people to learn to get to know a person before creating ideas about them based on what they look like. Encourage employers to instead of using different discrimination mechanism, take the time to give black people an opportunity to prove that they can be trustworthy, reliable, and good workers. By doing so, it could create equality within businesses and inspire other people to not be so quick to judge. \n\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\nDUE: 4/28/2021\nThe Neurology of Religion: Effects of Religion on Society\n\tAs long as homo sapiens has been walking, religion has been a huge part of motivation, interaction, and wellbeing. A lot of research has been done as to why people believe what they believe, and the validity of religious belief comes into question each time this is studied. Does religion have an impact on individuals? Does religion impact our interactions with others? While these can\u2019t be answered definitively, there are strong cases from each side of the argument. This paper will primarily address the major effects of religion, both positive and negative, on individuals and societal interactions and the importance of religion or lack thereof in society. \n\tThe research studied in class by Maryanski and Turner about the neurology of religion intrigued me, and as a psychology and religion double major, I couldn\u2019t help but become more and more fascinated by this concept the more I thought about it. As a religious person who is part of a religious community, I was told that it was a bad idea to research something that may argue against what I believe. But here I am doing it anyways, because how can I believe something without knowing the scientific processes of why I believe it, and why would I refuse to look at it from both sides? As I got further into this research, I saw that many sociologists and psychologists had contributed, as well as many renowned theologians. The contributions from both sides produced a well-rounded perspective that can help anybody realize that there are advantages and disadvantages to religion in a society that is rapidly turning away from it. Maryanski and Turner define the sociological perspective of religion as \u201cMore than just the propensity to behave in a religious manner. Religion is, at one and the same time, a neurological, behavioral, and organizational process (Maryanski and Turner, 2018). \n\tThe first question we must ask to see how religion impacts society is this: what are the effects of religious belief on individual wellbeing? Research from Christopher Ellison of Duke University suggests that religion enhances wellbeing in four ways. The first way that religion enhances wellbeing is through social integration and support. Humans have a longing for interaction with one another through various ways and being a part of a religious community helps satisfy this. The second way that religion enhances wellbeing is through the establishment of personal relationships with a divine other. This allows people to feel like they are specially made for a purpose, rather than a random result of evolutionary processes. The third way is through the provision of systems of meaning and existential processes, and like the second reason, this helps believers know that they have a purpose, and that humans exist for a reason greater than anyone can comprehend. The fourth way that religion enhances wellbeing is through the promotion of more specific patterns of religious organization and personal lifestyle (Ellison, 1991). Tying into Maryanski and Turner\u2019s definition of religion, Ellison conducted a study on how religion affects individual wellbeing. He asked random individuals to rate from one (low) to eight (high) their satisfaction with community life, nonworking activities or hobbies, family life, friendships, and health or physical condition. Those five categories are what Ellison says comprise \u201coverall wellbeing\u201d. The study resulted in substantial evidence of a positive influence of strong religious faith on higher life satisfaction, greater personal happiness, and fewer negative psychosocial consequences of traumatic life events. The study also showed that religious individuals who were affiliated with a specific sect or denomination reported higher life satisfaction than their unaffiliated counterparts. This first study shows that religion has a positive effect on overall wellbeing of individuals, and that life satisfaction has a positive correlation to the strength of one\u2019s faith.\n\tThe second question we must ask on how religion impacts society is this: how do religious communities interact with other communities, both religious and nonreligious? Similar to ethnocentrism, humans are drawn to those who share experiences, beliefs, and values, and religion helps unite them in that. However, while religion has a positive impact on the life satisfaction and general wellbeing of members of one group, groups often clash against one another because of various differences in belief or conflict of interests. One of the most notable examples of this is the Crusades. Early in the Second Millennium AD, Christians were encouraged to take up arms for what they believe and destroy all people who are nonbelievers. Another example is Islamic Jihad. While neither religion\u2019s text calls for violence against others, misinterpretation of sacred text and fear of \u201cthe other\u201d inspires members of religious communities to fight against other groups for political power or superiority. While members of religious groups interact well in smaller groups with members of other religions, the people in power and religious scholars tend not to associate with people who believe other things. The superiority complex of religious institutions is fascinating to me, that a group can believe that they have been ordained by their god to run the world. This makes religion sound like a perfect thing to create to generate income and gain support from people.\n\tWhile some religions and sects don\u2019t get along, many religions, namely Buddhism and other Asian religions, are encouraged to spread peace and love to everyone. Some sects of Christianity, like Presbyterians and Methodists, base the foundation of their theology not in conversion of others, but through the spread of their message through showing love to others, like the famous Christian hymn \u201cThey Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love\u201d. The positive interactions between religious groups have led to the formation of so many awesome organizations and communities. In my hometown of Raleigh, the Interfaith Food Shuttle is run by people of all religious backgrounds and served to everyone who needs it. My father, who is a Presbyterian minister, is good friends with an Imam, a Rabbi, and a Bhikkhuni. Every American holiday, they organize a service for upwards of five hundred people to celebrate and give thanks for each other and the holiday. We have inter-faith Thanksgiving service, inter-faith Memorial Day service, and inter-faith Independence Day service every year, and this is the pinnacle of religious cooperation and respect. My family celebrates Passover with the Rabbi\u2019s family, and his family celebrates Christmas eve with mine. To say that religious groups cannot have positive interactions would be an absolute lie, because the key to interaction is open-mindedness.\nUsing the answer to the previous two questions, we are able to get a better understanding of how religion impacts society. Because religion has been shown to increase individual life satisfaction and overall wellbeing, religion impacts the individual positively. Because of heightened religious tension, individuals find it more difficult to have positive interactions with people of other religious groups, but it isn\u2019t hard if one keeps an open mind. Religion would have the best impact on society as a whole if everyone was a member of the same religious community, but that will never be the case. It is hard for many religions to admit that other people have valid reasons for believing what they do, and I think this is because of their own religious insecurity. While I think that it is very beneficial to practice religion for social and individual wellbeing, I find it problematic that there is no evidence to prove the validity of religion, it is all based on tradition. Religion keeps members under control by both fear and mercy, that they can mess up and be forgiven, but if they mess up too badly, they may be struck down by their heavenly figure (K\u00f6hrsen, 2012). Another problem with religion is that it just came out of nowhere one day. A person can get a lot of support if they claim that they were ordained by the gods, and many people have taken advantage of that for political power. According to Jaco Beyer, in the case of South Africa, religion and politics have a long history of reciprocal collaboration and/or disagreement (Beyer, 2015). From the earliest societies to present day, religion has had influence on politics. Beyer says that the sacred is present in social institutions, laws are divine commandments, social classes are arranged hierarchically as determined by divine order, education is religious, economic behavior is regulated by the sacred, government is sacral, and that religion and government is an integrated system (Beyer, 2015). A lot of this was seen in colonization, and in Beyer\u2019s case, it was seen in both South Africa and Japan. Even nonreligious sociologists and psychologists seem to agree religion, when used correctly, is a vital part of society. \nBecause it answers difficult questions regarding life, death, struggles, and other topics, people tend to accept religious belief as truth and follow the other commandments and values of the given religion. Without religion, the world would be full of unmotivated people who are just waiting for death, knowing that life means nothing. Religion, when used incorrectly, has started the worst wars in history-- most wars have been the result of some kind of religious dispute that got out of hand, and this is part of what led Marx to say, \u201cReligion is the opiate of the people.\u201d While Marx argued that religion keeps people sedated and addicted, not even realizing how harmful it is, other people like Jens K\u00f6hrsen argued that religion is what enables people to do so many great things, such as giving to the poor, volunteering time to others, and caring about other people (K\u00f6hrsen, 2012). As I said earlier, when religion is used correctly, it is a beautiful piece of humanity that has many positive impacts on society. However, when it is used for political power or economic influence, its impact on society becomes negative. Religion is vital to a functioning society, and this can be seen in all of the ways I spoke about: Individual wellbeing, group interaction, and positive societal impact.\nMaryanski, Alexandria, and Turner, Jonathan H. \u201cThe Neurology of Religion: An Explanation From Evolutionary Sociology.\u201d Oxford Handbook of Evolution, Biology, and Society, 2018. file:///Users/colltharris/Downloads/The%20Neurology%20of%20Religion%20Maryanski%20and%20Turner%20(2).pdf.
