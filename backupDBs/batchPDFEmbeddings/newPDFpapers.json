        "text": "Bateman 1 \nChloe Bateman \nDr. Engelman \nSOC 433 \n17 October 2025 \nA Boy Broken Reflection \n\u201cA Broken Boy\u201d is a moving novel about Doug, a young man figuring out life with \nschizophrenia, and his father joining that journey. This journey highlights the daily struggles \nfrom choosing whether to shower that day or not, to believing you are seeing people who are \nnot really there. This book resonated with me on a deeper level as I connected it to many of \nthe struggles I have seen in my own brother, Taylor. Taylor is currently 23 years old, \nhowever, his own fight against ADHD, bipolar depression, and OCD started far before that.  \nBefore covering Taylor, I want to highlight the genetic role in mental disorders. My \nmom also has ADHD, and was, funnily enough, diagnosed at the same time as Taylor. My \nmom grew up in a household where mental disorders were looked down upon or seen as \nfoolish. My mom often struggled in school, finding it hard to pay attention, needing to go \nunder desks just to find some sort of peace. When she would bring up the idea of being tested \nby a physician, her father would quickly shoot it down, stating that \u201cthere was nothing wrong \nwith her\u201d. My mom knew that something made her different from everyone else, heavily in \ncomparison to her siblings, who seemed to do well in school. It was not until Taylor that she \never had the chance to understand what made her different. \nTaylor never did entirely well in elementary school through middle school, simply \ndoing enough each year to pass. When the thought of high school came around, my mother \nhad always wanted Taylor to go to the early college in my town. It was \u201cthe place\u201d to go to \nschool. Taylor eventually applied, enrolled, and started his high school career at JP Knapp \nEarly College. Not much later, at the beginning of his math class, his teacher contacted my \n\nBateman 2 \nmom with her concerns regarding Taylor. His teacher stated that he was having a hard time \nfocusing, completing assignments late, and not conversing with fellow classmates. My mom \nhad not noticed as she worked early mornings and late hours, making dinner time practically \nthe only time we spoke to her. Taylor's teacher refused to continue having him in her class \nuntil he got tested by a physician. \nShortly after this conversation, my mom decided to get both herself and Taylor tested \nfor learning disabilities and mental disorders that may impair their cognitive motor skills. \nThey ended up going to a psychiatrist named Nadine, whom they would end up seeing often \nto pick up medication. At the first meeting, Nadine helped diagnose Taylor and my mom. \nAfter doing lengthy assessments, Nadine came to the conclusion that they both had ADHD, \nwith my mom scoring higher than Taylor. They would soon be prescribed adderall, which \nturned out to be an effective treatment for both of them.  \nAfter Taylor had been medicated, he found himself focusing better in his classes, \ncoming up with schedules for himself, and starting to understand when he was falling into \nslumps. What we did not expect was that this would not be the last time Taylor would be \ndiagnosed with a mental disorder. Just when we started to believe that Taylor was in a good \nplace, everything took a grim turn.  \nSimilar to Doug, Taylor started to care less about hygiene, resorted to smoking weed, \nand became distant from his family. Taylor was always a hilarious, light-hearted individual, \nso when his personality took this drastic turn, we knew something was wrong. My mom, dad, \nyounger brothers, and I would all try to talk to him about any issues he is having. However, \nthis always resulted in a cold shoulder. I cannot say this was entirely unexpected, as my \nsiblings and I started to experience a life filled with domestic abuse, CPS visits, and my \nfather continuously ending up in jail. This made Taylor's mental health problems seem small \nin comparison to my father's alcohol abuse.  \n\nBateman 3 \nWhile my mom was always busy trying to fix my father's alcohol abuse by taking him \nin and out of the police station and rehabilitation centers, Taylor found comfort in speaking to \nme. Taylor and I were always quite close since we were little, and we only got closer due to \nour troubled household. Time passed quickly, and he eventually graduated from high school \nand enrolled in an online community college. He seemed to be hopeful about obtaining a \ncriminal justice degree. My family was never very well off financially, so having to pay for \nhis education gave my mom an incentive to keep a close eye on his grades. He was living at \nhome at the time, so this made daily check-ins simple. \nThe cycle started to repeat, and Taylor was found once again slipping in his classes, \nnearing failing his courses this time. Rightfully so, my mother would get upset with him \nanytime she found him falling behind in his courses. Eventually, I decided to pressure Taylor \ninto telling me why he was struggling, and he finally cracked. I did not understand the \nmagnitude of the trauma Taylor experienced from my father until he told me he was \nconsidering suicide. He expressed that he had dark thoughts of hurting himself and often \nstruggled to push these thoughts away. These thoughts made the simplest tasks like brushing \nhis teeth in the morning seem gigantic. He begged and pleaded with me not to tell my mom \nabout his suicidal thoughts, but I could not imagine the thought of not having Taylor in my \nlife. I told Taylor that there is help for these thoughts, portraying them similarly to the help he \nreceived for his ADHD. I also knew that anything I say or do is not nearly as supportive as \nwhat a therapist or psychiatrist could provide him. I promised to be by his side every step of \nthe way. He deserved help and should not have to deal with this alone.  \nI soon told my mom the thoughts Taylor was having. I cannot begin to express the \npure fear on my mother's face knowing that there was a chance of losing her first child, her \nbaby boy. She could not help but embrace Taylor closely, making sure he knew that we were \nthere for him. Once again, my mom took Taylor to the psychiatrist in the hopes that they \n\nBateman 4 \nwould be able to assess him and find a proper treatment for him. After much more testing, \nwaiting in lobbies, and therapist visits, they came to the conclusion that Taylor had bipolar \ndepression and OCD. The psychiatrist explained the seriousness behind the conglomerate of \nthese mental disorders, but there are more prescriptions that they would be able to provide to \nTaylor. Soon enough, Taylor was taking three daily pills to help steady his head and attending \ntherapy sessions.  \nWhile Taylor still struggled, he was able to finish his associate's degree in criminal \njustice promptly. My mom strongly believed that once Taylor obtained this degree and started \nin the police academy, the fight against his mental disorders would be over. He would finally \nhave purpose. This was quickly disproven when he did not make it into the police academy. \nTaylor was completely distraught and frankly had no will to live the minute he found out that \nhe did not pass the police academy tests. He had no other plans for himself and resorted to \nlying in bed all day, rotting. Getting him to find meaning in life turned from hills to \nmountains.  \nAt this point, I was accepted into UNCW and was incredibly excited to start my own \neducational journey through sociology. I cannot say that I was not worried about Taylor, as he \nstill did not have a strong pull to anything. However, I knew that I had my own education to \nworry about. Taylor never went to a four year institution due to not needing to, so I kept him \nupdated on my journey, sharing the fun activities I was doing. He was always excited for the \nupdates, phone calls, or visits as it was something so different than what he was used to. For \nthe first time in a long time, I could see this sparkle in his eye, like he was plotting \nsomething.  \nAfter a few months into my freshman year, Taylor decided he would also attend \nUNCW in the hopes of finding himself just as I did. He hurried to apply, excited about what \nthe future would hold. The day that Taylor got accepted was possibly one of the greatest \n\nBateman 5 \nmoments because, for once, he had hope. He would often say that hope was such a sad word \nsince there is the chance of disappointment, so seeing this side of him brought genuine tears \nto my eyes. His pessimistic personality finally let off grasp of his head and let him see the \nlight. He had decided to come in as a transfer the second semester of my freshman year.  \nTaylor's decision to attend UNCW was one of the best decisions he ever made. He \nfound a great group of friends, a passion for education, the pursuit of a career as a teacher, \nand his version of happiness in the world. While he still lives at home due to his mental \nstruggles, I could not be prouder of him. He is not letting his ADHD, bipolar depression, or \nOCD get the best of him. If you told me a few years ago that Taylor would be where he is \ntoday, I would say that you were crazy. However, I could not be happier to be the furthest \nthing from wrong. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBateman 6 \nCitation \nHanging Indented Citation\u2026",

        "text": "Savannah Snow \nDr. Engelman \nSOC 433 \nOctober 17th, 2025 \nA Boy Broken- A Reflective Essay  \n \nThroughout the exploration of the sociology of mental disorders we have read the \ntextbook by William Cockerham that depicts a research based writing that delves into mental \ndisorders in a predominantly clinical and academic tone. The book, A Boy Unbroken by Douglas \nEngelman takes a much more personal look into the life and story of not just an individual who is \nstruggling with a mental disorder, but at the support of their family and the effect it has on the \nrest of their lives. A Boy Unbroken seeks to educate and aid those who are struggling with mental \ndisorders and their caretakers by letting them into the world of Douglas Engelman and his son, \nDouglas Jr., as he is diagnosed and treated for schizophrenia. There are many components of this \nbook and the writing style of Dr. Engelman which contributes to such a moving and emotional \njourney. The switch in the tone between sociological thinking and education, to the emotional \ntoil of his own family, the emphasis that is placed on the caregivers, and the descriptive \nemotional nature of the book make it an amazing depiction of mental health and the impact that \nit has on the people around those affected. \nThose who have experience with sociology and mental disorders in a research or \nacademic setting can take away skills and knowledge about how to treat those who have been \ndiagnosed with mental disorders. However, I don\u2019t think that many people have that educational \nbackground. Books like A Boy Broken are incredibly useful tools that aid in understanding and \ncan be helpful to those who are struggling. While Dr. Engelman focuses on the emotional and \npersonal side of his story, he also includes aspects that are more clinical. When introducing the \nidea of stigma, Dr. Engelman talks about labeling theory and how it relates to social norms from \na sociological perspective. This can help to gain insight about how outside individuals may react \n \n\n \nto someone with a mental disorder and how deeply integrated this social stigma is within our \nsociety. This stigma also radiates to the family of those who are mentally ill which is incredibly \nhard to deal with. Additionally, when talking about perceptions of those who have mental \ndisorders there is a degree of fear that they might act violently. Dr. Engelman also breaks this \ndown in the book. Engelman states that \u201c a very small number of individuals found to be \nseverely mentally ill commit any violent acts in a year\u2019s time\u201d (Engelman, 2023, p. 34). This \ndepicts the difference between reality and stigma. While individuals may believe that those with \nmental disorders may act violently, in research, this is uncommon. This stereotype of those with \nmental disorders  as violent individuals can prevent them from getting the treatment and the \nsupport that they need. Even Dr. Engelman in the book, talks about how he and his wife Wendy, \nwere apprehensive to have his son around their smaller children. I also grew up with this \nstereotype that those who are struggling with mental disorders can be violent and that I need to \nbe cautious around them. However, there are many factors that contribute to violence and there \nneeds to be a change in this mindset. Through my classes I know I have learned to think \ndifferently and this book can help others to broaden their understanding too. If this stigma \ncontinues, it takes away opportunities for those who are struggling with mental disorders to \nreturn to normal life and be around the people that they love and who love them.   \nIt takes a great amount of strength to write about someone who is struggling with mental \nhealth as their life is full of difficulties and it is hard to let people in when you are struggling. I \nhave read books in the past where those who are struggling with mental disorders tell their story \nand their experiences. However, this is the first story I have read from the perspective of the \ncaregiver. Caregivers are incredibly important and their stories often get overlooked. Reading \nabout everything that Dr. Engelman went through to provide for his son and help him get better, \n\n \nand the mental and emotional effect that it must have had on him was very impactful for me. Dr. \nEngelman talks about the deep relationships that can develop when caring for family, but it also \ntakes an emotional toll. As a caregiver, you are responsible for pushing them to go to treatment \nand trying to maintain consistency within their life. It can produce some trying moments \nespecially if someone does not want to be treated or is completely unaware of the way that they \nare acting. In the book, Dr. Engelman talks about making sure that Doug Jr, is taking his \nmedicine and checking in with him about going to the therapy sessions. My mom constantly has \nto check in with my grandmother to make sure that she stays consistent with taking her medicine \nand making sure that she goes to her appointments. I can see the way that it wears on her. If my \ngrandmother does not take her medicine, I can see how it stresses my mom out and how she \nworries for her mom. It is especially difficult when someone has no experience caring for \nsomeone in that capacity. It is a constant learning curve and often families and individuals turn to \nresources like the internet and books to learn. Books like A Boy Broken can provide support and \ncommunity, letting readers know that there are people out there who have made this commitment \nand are going through this journey. I knew from the start of the book that it would focus on the \ncaregiving of Doug Jr., but the reality was so much more impactful and emotional due to their \nclose relationship.  \nDr. Engelman opens the book with the life changing moment where he receives the phone \ncall letting him know that his son has died. This sets the emotional tone for the rest of the book \nas truthful, open, and intense. Dr. Engelman does not shy away from the harsh reality that he and \nhis family went through and I think it\u2019s incredibly impressive to be able to express this story and \nnot shy away from any of the reality or the missteps. Throughout the book, Engelman retells \nvarious defining moments that he remembers with his son as he got diagnosed and treated for \n\n \nschizophrenia. For example, in the first chapter, he talks about the moment where Doug Jr. told \nhim about his hallucinations for the first time after having a psychotic break, and how Dr. \nEngelman was \u201covercome with fear and confusion\u201d and a \u201c need to understand what is going on\u201d \nwith his son (Engelman, 2023, p. 9). This display of emotions, the confusion, and the need for \nclarity are so important for so many people who go through this discovery. Especially when it \ncomes to mental disorders like schizophrenia which have such extreme symptoms like \nhallucinations or when the diagnosis feels out of character, there are often feelings of confusion. \nI have people in my life who, when they began to experience symptoms of mental disorders, my \nfamily did not know what to do and did not know how to feel or react. Later in the book when \nDoug Jr. disappears from the Madden group home, Dr. Engelman talks about the worry that he \nfeels for his son and the guilt that he feels for denying Doug Jr. a place to stay earlier in the \nchapter, and driving him back to Madden where he eventually leaves without telling anyone. He \nemploys this \u201ctough love\u201d throughout the book in an effort to get Doug Jr. to go to treatment and \ntake his medication, but there are doubts about making the right choices. Many parents struggle \nwith the worry about making the right choices for their children. I imagine it is so much worse \nwhen your decisions have such an impact on your child\u2019s mental health and overall wellbeing. I \nknow my family has worried about how to treat the mental health issues in my family. They \nworry about what treatment would work the best and how they can be supportive and accepting \ntoo. One of the moments that also stuck out to me emotionally was the chapter on shame and \nstigma. Even as the world progresses, there is still a lot of stigma surrounding mental disorders. \nDr. Engelman talks about how he would tell his neighbors and friends a version of his son, \nleaving out the mention of his mental health and struggles. He encompasses this internal struggle \nof shame and stigma when he says \u201cI was torn between the need to focus on him, support and \n\n \nlove him, and at the same time hide him from friends and family\u201d (Engelman, 2023, p. 39). \nHaving depictions like these that showcase the variety of emotions that one goes through is so \nimportant for those who can relate to this book. It made me sad that there are so many people \nwho can relate to the shame and that there is still a barrier surrounding conversations about \nmental health. These are just a few of the many examples of high emotion events where Dr. \nEngelman does not shy away from telling the truth, which contributes to the impact of the \nwriting and his story. I cannot imagine what any of this felt like as I have never had these \nexperiences to this degree, but Dr. Engelman does a great job of taking us along with him.      \nOverall, I have never read a book like this. It draws you into the journey of Dr. Engelman \nand his son and their journey along with the rest of the family through mental health struggles. It \ngoes into the symptoms specifically of schizophrenia which traditionally has a more negative \nsociological impact compared to other mental disorders. Dr. Engelman's writing also touches on \nthe academic and sociological side while focusing on the personal relationships and emotional \ncomponent to give hard research on the studies being done around mental disorders. \nAdditionally, all of the descriptive and emotional moments, and the emphasis on the caregiver \nand their journey accumulate into a book that draws you in and helps individuals feel seen.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nEngelman, D. J. (2023). A Boy Broken: A Father\u2019s Journey Through His Son\u2019s Mental Illness, \nLoss, and a Search for Meaning. Kindle Direct.",

        "text": "Kenyon 1 \nAlexis L. Kenyon \nMidterm Essay \nSOC-345 \nDr. Douglas Engelman \nThe Future of Family: Ezra and Violet Clancy-Jackson \nBy the year 2035, the idea of the \u201ctypical American family\u201d will have undergone a \nsignificant change. Ezra and Violet Clancy-Jackson are an example of evolving gender norms, \nand the economic demands of dual-income households, equal sharing of both professional and \ndomestic labor, redefining what it means to be a family in America. Their relationship highlights \nhow modern families are rethinking what it means to be an egalitarian family. Over the years, \nAmerican family structures have noticeably shifted due to lower marriage rates, women working \nfull-time, and more diverse family types. Arlie Hochschild\u2019s The Second Shift described gender \ndisparities in domestic work, but by 2035, these roles have become more flexible and equally \nshared. In the Clancy-Jackson household: Ezra, Violet, their daughter Jada, and adopted son \nTeddy, responsibilities are shared equally by both parents, reflecting these societal changes.  \nViolet is a very self-assured woman. She worked for the first twenty-six years of her life, \nearning her doctorate in Pharmacy. Now thirty-eight years old, she happily works as a \nPharmacist for a large Lab Corporation in Boston. She has a loving husband who supports her \nevery endeavor and two beautiful children. Violet works full-time and commutes an hour each \nway. Most mornings she\u2019s out the door before sunrise, and she doesn\u2019t get back until around six, \njust in time for dinner. But despite how committed she is to her work, she always makes time for \nher family.  After they have dinner together, Violet cleans up the kitchen with Jada's help. Since \nEzra spends most of his day caring for their son, Violet takes charge of the bedtime routine with \n\nKenyon 2 \nTeddy to give her husband some time to relax after dinner. She helps him bathe, tucks him in \nbed, and reads him a story until he falls asleep. After the toddler is sleeping, Ezra, Violet, and \nJada spend quality time together, watching movies and relaxing.  \nEzra has always wanted to be a father. He and Violet met at SUNY Brockport during \ntheir third year of college. After graduation, they moved to Boston so Violet could be closer to \nher Pharmacy school program. After moving, Ezra used his degree in software engineering to get \na job at a tech startup company in the city. While Violet was in school, Ezra\u2019s generous salary \nsupported them both. Three years after graduation, they were married. And two years after that, \nthey had their first child, Jada. A few months after Jada was born, Ezra and Violet agreed that he \nwould work remotely and that Violet would return to work. He knew she had a great passion for \nher job and wanted to help as much as he could. After all, he loved being a father and had always \nbeen the more nurturing of the two. Especially when Jada was younger, Ezra spent the majority \nof his day with his daughter. Before she started school, he would teach her how to read basic \nwords and write the alphabet. When they rode in the car, they would sing along to his mix of \nupbeat pop and rock songs. And since his family lived nearby, he would often take her on \nplaydates with her cousins and over to his parents\u2019 house to spend time with Gigi and Papa. As \nJada got older, Ezra spent more hours working from home while she was in school. When their \ndaughter was nine, Ezra and Violet decided they wanted another kid, but this time they would \nadopt a one-year-old boy named Theodore, whom they now call Teddy. The family assumed the \nsame roles with Teddy as they did with Jada. Ezra took on most of the daytime childcare while \nhis wife was at work, and Violet was responsible for nighttime duties after she got home.  \nBoth members of the couple took turns with cooking and cleaning. But their rule was that \nwhoever cooked didn't have to clean up the kitchen, so if Ezra cooked, Violet would clean up, \n\nKenyon 3 \nand vice versa. The family has a routine of a \u201cSunday deep-clean,\u201d where the entire household, \nincluding the kids, splits the chores amongst themselves to make sure their home is tidy before \nthe end of the week. This division of household labor works well for the family. Since both \nparents are bringing in income, it is only fair for them to split their domestic responsibilities as \nequally as possible. The couple is quite patient with one another and understands there will be \ntimes when one has to pick up the slack when the other is feeling off or too busy.  \nEzra\u2019s experience as a stay-at-home father in 2035 is a perfect example of Andrea \nDoucet\u2019s description of stay-at-home fathers in her article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Almost Like I Have a Job, \nbut I Don\u2019t Get Paid\u201d: Fathers at Home Reconfiguring Work, Care and Masculinity. Like the \nmen in Doucet\u2019s study, Ezra performs both paid and unpaid labor. He works part-time from home \nwhile handling most of the childcare and some of the housework. His role challenges the \ntraditional view that masculinity is defined by breadwinning. This demonstrates how definitions \nof work and fatherhood continue to change over time (Doucet 2004). Ezra\u2019s role as an involved \nstay-at-home dad represents a considerable shift AWAY from traditional masculinity. Instead of \nseeing his role as \u201cless than\u201d or \u201csubservient\u201d because he is no longer the primary source of \nfinancial income, Ezra is proud to be an involved father. He values being present with his \nchildren, supporting his wife, and creating a happy home. This 2035 family model illustrates a \nmove toward more flexible gender roles, where domestic work and emotional labor are shared \nmore equally between partners. However, as Doucet noted, Ezra may still face social pressures \nregarding his status as a \u201cworking man.\u201d Doucet\u2019s findings help explain how even in 2035, \nfamilies like the Clancy-Jacksons are still navigating the balance between gender expectations \nand new forms of equality at home. \n\nKenyon 4 \nEven when families shaped like these become more common in the future, they will \ncontinue to face problems from those with more traditionally conservative viewpoints and \npreferences. Those with those views may view Violet as an \u201cuninvolved mother\u201d or \u201ctoo busy\u201d \nfor her family, and Ezra as \u201cunemployed\u201d or a \u201cmooch off his wife.\u201d These criticisms highlight \nhow some members of society still expect families to look a certain way, regardless of how they \nactually may live. In the year 2035, the Clancy-Jackson family may look ordinary, nonetheless, it \nconstitutes a step in the right direction toward reinventing what a typical family looks like and \nachieving more common egalitarian households. In addition to struggles with social pressures, \nthis family also faces financial challenges that shape their decision to be a dual-income \nhousehold. The economy is a major driver of family structures. As housing, childcare, and \nhealthcare costs continue to rise, most families (including this one) require two or more incomes \nto get by. This makes it more common for both parents to work full-time. A positive solution is \nfor more companies to offer remote work as a full- or part-time option. This option has made it \neasier for parents like Ezra to stay home while still earning income, and more employers now \noffer flexible hours or parental leave for both mothers and fathers. In their article Hours of Paid \nWork in Dual-Earner Couples: The United States in Cross-National Perspective, Jerry Jacobs \nand Janet Gornick (2002) compare how much time men and women spend in paid work across \ndifferent countries. Violet and Ezra Clancy-Jackson\u2019s lifestyle reflects many of the challenges \nJacobs and Gornick describe. Violet works full-time with a long commute to work, while Ezra\u2019s \nflexible schedule allows him time to care for their family. Their situation shows how work \nstructures in the United States can make it difficult for families to balance paid and unpaid labor. \nLike the couples in Jacobs and Gornick\u2019s (2002) study, the Clancy-Jackson family must \nconstantly split time, energy, and expectations between work and home. Their experience also \n\nKenyon 5 \nhighlights how policy changes (such as better parental leave or flexible work hours) make it \neasier for dual-earner and caregiving families to thrive or even just exist. In this way, Ezra and \nViolet portray both the progress and ongoing pressures faced by working families in the United \nStates.  \nThe Clancy-Jackson family displays how the American family structure has changed \nsignificantly over time, yet it also shows how some societal struggles remain the same. Violet \nand Ezra\u2019s partnership is built on shared respect and flexibility, they divide work and care in \nways that make sense for their lives, not just their genders. Their family indicates the growing \ntrend of women leading as breadwinners, men taking on more caregiving roles, and families as a \nwhole finding new ways to balance work, love, and responsibility. From a sociologist\u2019s \nperspective, studying families like the Clancy-Jacksons helps us understand not only how \nfamilies function, but also what they say about society as a whole. They remind us that family is \na structure that is known to change over time and shaped by culture, social expectations, and \neconomics. By 2035, we can only hope that we, as a society, continue to move in a positive \ndirection toward gender equality and a more normalized, egalitarian standard, highlighting that \nthere is no singular right way to be a \u201cnormal\u201d American family anymore, but instead, many \ndifferent ways to support those you love.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nKenyon 6 \nReferences:  \n1.\u200b Doucet, Andrea. 2004. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s Almost Like I Have a Job, but I Don\u2019t Get Paid\u2019: Fathers at \nHome Reconfiguring Work, Care, and Masculinity.\u201d Fathering: A Journal of Theory, \nResearch, and Practice about Men as Fathers 2(3):277\u2013303. \n2.\u200b Hochschild, Arlie Russell, and Anne Machung. 2012.

        "text": "Reading the book \u201cA Boy Broken\u201d was truly heartbreaking while keeping me informed \non the more medical side of things at the same time. I fought tears throughout my time reading \nand couldn\u2019t help but absolutely feel for you as the author. I struggle now with my mental health \nand especially did when I was 9-13, this amplified as the pandemic hit. Your experiences with \nyour son growing distant and changing physically resonated with me because I know that\u2019s \nexactly what I put my mom through during those years.  \n \nThe way you wrote this book truly showed how deeply you cared about your son while \nadmitting your faults at the same time, even thinking about how you could\u2019ve done better is \nbeyond important. Reading what you felt when Doug was diagnosed is now ingrained into my \nhead because that shame and denial is a step in this process that needs to be addressed so it can \ngrow into understanding. \n \nThe journey of you and your son was both exciting and gut-wrenching, knowing you had \nto see the boy you thought you knew transform into a shell of who he used to be for 8 years. \nGrowing up in a home with parents who dislike each other or are inexperienced can definitely \ntake a toll on a child\u2019s mind but with an illness like schizophrenia that\u2019s so unpredictable, it\u2019s \nimpossible to find someone to \u201cblame\u201d. I have an increasingly worsening relationship with my \nfather so reading about your guilt and shame really hit me because what if that\u2019s how my dad \nfeels about how I turned out? Or maybe how he was never there for my sister and I \neducationally? Dealing with a diagnosis like this is terrifying and you went above and beyond for \nyour boy. \n \n\nThe steady decline of Doug was something I could relate to because I went down the \nsame path without the access to drugs of course due to age. I was unaware of how my actions of \nstarvation or isolation affected my family so seeing it from a parental perspective gave me that \ninsight that maybe I needed when I was 13. I almost was admitted to a facility like Doug was \nbecause my mom thought I would never get better but that extra support started to slowly knock \nmy brain out of its depressive episode. \n \nI appreciated the explanations of stigma and grief that were in the book, it enlightened me \non things I thought I understood. Being able to read how stigma affected your family was both \nrelatable and also broke my heart slightly. Having to hide your son who couldn\u2019t be seen as \n\u2018normal\u2019 in society is an impossible task to complete without shame and guilt. I never once \nduring my experience reading this book felt like you didn\u2019t love your son. I\u2019ll say it a lot but you \ndid everything you could and should have for him. It\u2019s hard to keep track of an adult version of \nyour child because they have that independence and anonymity among society now. \n \nThis was an especially hard read because before Doug\u2019s death there was that hope of \n\u2018things are going to get better\u2019 and they did before that was ripped away from him. He struggled \nwith substance abuse and his disorder but his passing had nothing to do with that, he died \nsuddenly and was becoming the man he was always meant to be. I don\u2019t want this to come across \nas me babying your son or putting him on a pedestal, I just want to highlight how he was truly \ngetting better. \n \n\nI\u2019m glad you mentioned your own emotions that may be seen as harmful or controversial \nduring such a tough time, anger is a common reaction and should be recognized. I would also be \nangry if I knew my son was ill but still went out seeking pot, it\u2019s a natural response. The constant \nemotional reminders humanized you for me more, I saw you as who you were as a father and not \njust a teacher. Acknowledging our faults during grief and loss is hard but you got through it and \neven wrote a book about it. Self reflection and searching for a new meaning in life is once again \nnatural and even needed sometimes like it was with you. \n \nYou went through hell with your son and finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel \nwith him getting better and I hate that fate decided to rob both you and your son of that lovely \nfuture. In the epilogue I was delighted to see that you were able to laugh with your life and \nreconnect over a tragedy such as this, I know that death can often drive families apart. This book \nwas able to become both a tribute to your son and insight to how a frightening diagnosis like \nschizophrenia can change everyone\u2019s life forever.\u200b\n \n \nI cried during this book because like I mentioned, I see a lot of myself in who Doug was \nduring his toughest times. Understanding the grief of losing a child just a little bit makes me \nthink back on the pain I would\u2019ve put my mom through if I had ended my own life. It helped me \nrealize how my actions affected way more than just me, it hurt my mom, my sister, my friends. \nThis was also almost healing for me since my dad isn\u2019t in my life much mentally that being able \nto read how much you loved your son made me think that maybe I\u2019m just not understanding how \nmy dad feels during all of these things. \n \n\nI don\u2019t want this to become about my struggle even though you said you wanted \nconnections, it feels insensitive. This book is a message of love, anger, grief, and knowledge, it \ngrows to resonate with its reader like it did with me. Even throughout the more research centric \nchapters I couldn\u2019t look away, I needed to understand why this was important and how it \ntranslated to your own personal life. It was informative and I liked the format of all of this \ninformation and then you pointing out how it showed in your son and/or yourself. \n \nI know this is a reflection but I feel bad for how much that I\u2019m repeating, I just really do \nbelieve you were the best dad you could be to a man as troubled as Doug. Nothing about \nschizophrenia is easy and I\u2019m glad that near the end he was experiencing the life he missed out \non for the past 8 years. He got to be a form of himself again and that\u2019s not possible to say about \nsome of the other folks with the same diagnosis. Loss is never easy and I don\u2019t want my words to \ncome across as if I know how either you or Doug felt because that\u2019s not true, I think I just want \nto be hopeful during such a heart breaking event. If I didn\u2019t say it enough, this book was \ninsightful, meaningful, and an eye opener for me. \n \n I went into this thinking that I would somehow be crazy different from your son because \nour diagnoses are different but that\u2019s not even close to true and I believe that\u2019s why this hit so \nhard for me. I\u2019m not completely different from him and just like him I gained a support group \nthat will help me no matter what through anything, no matter how much I push them away. \nThank you for this experience and allowing me to see the amount of love you had for Douglas.",

But with a closer look, especially through a \nsociological lens, the reality isn't a decline in family structure\u2013it's a deep adaptation (Smock et \nal., 2005). The traditional nuclear family, with clear rules and reliance on a single male income, \nhas become unsustainable for most people. By the year 2035, the American family will be \ndefined by its adaptation to two main issues that today\u2019s families face as well: the economic \ninstability of modern life and the fact that the gender revolution that started in the 1970s is still \nonly half-finished. With this, the diverse, flexible, and occasionally complex family structures \nwe see now\u2013single-parent, blended families, cohabitation, LGBTQ+ families\u2013aren't signs of \nfailure that many deem it to be, but instead they are the foundation of strategies people in the \nmid-2030s will use to survive under immense systemic pressure. \nThe Deinstitutionalization of Marriage and Defining \u201cCapstone\u201d \nThe biggest change in family structure is arguably the evolution of marriage itself. \nSociologist Andrew Cherlin calls this the deinstitutionalization of marriage (Cherlin, 2004). This \ndeinstitutionalization essentially means that marriage has lost its out-dated, strict rulebook, and \nthis regression of the institution as a whole will leave what\u2019s left of these \u2018rules\u2019 completely \ndisregarded by 2035. Marriage used to be an institution governed by social and religious norms, \ntelling you who to marry, when to marry, and what your role was (breadwinner or homemaker). \nToday, those norms have largely broken down. Marriage is now seen as an \u201cindividualized \nmarriage\u201d, focused entirely on personal happiness, emotional fulfillment, and self-development. \nWhile marriage is less necessary than it used to be (we don't need it for economic \nsurvival or social approval anymore), its symbolic value has skyrocketed. It\u2019s no longer the \n\n3 \nmarker beginning adulthood; it is now the capstone\u2013the expensive, celebratory achievement that \nhappens after a couple feels they have succeeded financially\u2013and it will most likely be \nincreasingly referred to as a capstone considering the increase of financial instability citizens \nexperience today. Many cohabiting couples simply delay marriage, saying, \"everything's there \nexcept the money,\u201d (Smock et al., 2005). They feel it\u2019s best to secure a solid education, income, \nand stability before they can afford the symbolic and (mainly) financial weight of a wedding, a \nhouse, and starting a family. \nThis new term of \"capstone\" is now a distinct marker of class stratification\u2013layers of our \nsociety created by class-based groups, or, as Betsy Lucal describes it, a system of oppression and \nprivilege (Lucal, 1994). Those with higher education and financial security are more likely to \nmarry and stay married, benefiting from the stability and resources the institution provides. \nWhile on the other hand, those facing greater financial strain, debt, and less education are often \nforced to delay marriage, increasing their likelihood of instability within their cohabitation as \nthey consistently battle these other factors. As Stephanie Coontz notes, economic insecurity puts \nimmense stress on low-income parents, making it harder for them to achieve the \"financial \nreadiness\" required for the capstone (Coontz, 2006). After considering these dynamics, it is clear \nthat marriage has become a luxury item, reinforcing the socioeconomic gap rather than closing it. \nIn 2035, it is highly possible that a marriage certificate will function less as social support, or a \nsafety net, and more as a marker of class distinction. \nThe Unfinished Evolution of Gender and the Perpetuation of the Patriarchal Hierarchy \n\u200b\nAnother major sensitivity of the modern family is the stark imbalance between men and \nwomen's roles. Women successfully entered the workforce in massive numbers\u2013a huge \nrevolution in society considering previous views on women in the workplace. But in home and \n\n4 \nfamily life, women\u2019s roles did not change fast enough. Arlie Hochschild coined the term \"stalled \nrevolution\" to describe this problem: women took on paid work, but men more often than not did \nnot take on the unpaid domestic and emotional work (Hochschild, 1989). This leaves a clear \nimbalance of domestic workloads. \nFor dual-earner couples, this refers directly to the \"second shift,\" which is the unpaid \nlabor (referred to as domestic work) of housekeeping, cooking, childcare, and coordinating \nfamily life that disproportionately falls on women after their full day of paid work is over. In the \nU.S., we are dramatically behind other industrialized nations in providing social support like \naffordable childcare and comprehensive paid leave (Jacobs, 2002). When state government and \ncorporate policies fail to provide support, families are essentially placed back into traditional \ngender roles\u2014even if those roles don't work financially anymore (Lewis, 2001). \nIt is also important to note that this work imbalance is measurable, and that the \nmeasurement of it helps define the \u2018why\u2019 behind how families get pushed into traditional gender \nroles. Two measurable factors for this work imbalance are the motherhood penalty and the \nfatherhood bonus, as defined by sociologist Michelle Budig. Budig found that motherhood \ninflicts a significant wage penalty on women (Budig, 2014). Unfortunately, mothers are often \nseen by employers as less competent or less committed, leading to lower wages and fewer \npromotions. Conversely, the fatherhood bonus provides a wage gain for fathers (Budig, 2014), a \ntechnicality that may devastatingly remain considering the firm chokehold the patriarchy \nhas\u2013and has always had\u2013on society.  \nWith men consistently earning more\u2013regardless of parental status, considering the gender \nwage gap\u2013it puts women in a difficult position of not always being able to reach their full \n\n5 \npotential. And with men having the ability to make such high salaries, it drives a continual \nperpetuation of gender roles that have been placed in society for centuries. \nAlong with this, Christine Percheski's work on professional women suggests the pressure \nof the second shift is so intense, it necessitates \"opting out\" of high-powered careers due to the \nimmense difficulty of juggling work and motherhood without adequate support (Percheski, \n2008). This stressor of domestic work in 2035 may still be one of the most significant sources of \nmarital stress, proving that \u201chaving it all\u201d will be structurally impossible without major policy \nchanges that\u2013as cross-national data shows\u2013the U.S. has been historically slow in adopting \n(Jacobs & Gornick, 2002).  \nThe 2035 Family: Kinship and Support Systems \n\u200b\nBecause the traditional American nuclear family is too financially unstable\u2013as well as \nbeing too burdened by the second shift\u2013a typical 2035 American family may consist of a \nflexible, intentional, and resourceful support network\u2013extending far beyond the family's home \nitself. The kinship networks will be an essential and mainstream model of resilience. For \nexample, the chosen kin concept is built on love, commitment, and mutual support rather than \nbiology or legal ties to one another. This chosen kin concept will be a necessity for a large \nportion of the population, not just the LGBTQ+ community who structured it (Weston, 1991; \nMoore, 2013). The rising costs of childcare, housing, and elder care will require friends to \nbecome trusted \u201caunties\u201d and co-residing \u201cuncles\u201d who share resources and labor. \n\u200b\nSimilar to this model, the black kindred model is where low-income families form \nexpansive, mutual networks to fight against economic shocks (Stack, 1972). This system may \nbecome a major survival strategy as well, regardless of whether or not it is acknowledged by \nsociety. \n\n6 \n\u200b\nAdditionally, lesbian and gay families have often formed around the idea of equality, and \nthis may continue as a sort of prototype for how relationships negotiate roles without relying on a \nmale-breadwinner family structure. However, as Mignon Moore\u2019s work on black lesbian \nstepfamilies demonstrated, gendered power dynamics are deeply cultural (Moore, 2011). It is \ntotally possible that in 2035, biological and caregiving ties will continue to hold greater power \nand authority over household organization and finance, revealing the persistence of the gender \n\u2018culture\u2019 even in the absence of a male partner.  \nConclusion \n\u200b\nTo conclude, the family of 2035 may not have one established look, it will likely \nencompass a whole variety of family structures, some including non-blood-related individuals. \nWhile some financially secure couples will celebrate a \u201ccapstone\u201d marriage, the majority will \nhave an expansive, intentional, and resourceful support system that will be built to withstand the \npressures that the singular traditional family \u201cideal\u201d could not handle. This type of fluid, \nelaborate support system will be the real, strong family model of the future. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \nReferences \nBudig, M. J. (2014).

        "text": "Over the past decade, the cultural shift for American families has moved away from \ntraditionalism and toward modernity. During this time, American society has seen an increase in \ndivorce rates, a decline in marriage rates, an increase in mothers in the workforce, an increase in \nsingle-parent households, a rise in blended families, and an increase in same-sex families. \nCurrent trends indicate that by 2035, the traditional family model will be even closer to \nextinction than it is now. However, Gen Z and younger generations are seeking religion and \noffering hope to those looking for a return to traditionalism. \nThe current trends in marriage are showing several interesting findings. One of these is \nthe overall declining rate of marriage. In 2024, U.S. adults were less likely to be married than at \nalmost any point in history (USAFacts, 2023). The overall rate of decrease in marriage is easily \nexplained by the decrease in religiosity in today\u2019s population. Since 2014, there has been a 9 \npercent drop in those who identify as Christian (Pew Research Center, 2025). While obviously \nChristianity is not the only religion, it is the most important in the U.S. and still reflects the \noverall drop in religiosity. This drop in religiosity could also be a reason why there has been such \nan increase in single parenting and an increase in adults living together in relationships without \nbeing married. \nOverall, cultural trends are pushing certain lifestyles that may have been unacceptable a \ncouple of decades ago to being acceptable now. People mainly feel that consenting adults should \nbe able to be with other adults in several different capacities that do not involve marriage or that \nmay not involve traditional marriage. This change is also responsible for the different types of \nparenting seen now, and why some styles of traditional marriages or parenting are looked down \nupon. Today, the overall shift from traditional family structures to nontraditional structures is \nstaggering. One piece of research done by Pew found that \u201cthe share of children living in a \n\ntwo-parent household is at the lowest point in more than half a century: 69% are in this type of \nfamily arrangement today, compared with 73% in 2000 and 87% in 1960\u201d (Pew Research Center, \n2015). \nBesides the change in religiosity, there are other explanations for why there has been such \na decrease in the traditional family. A good one to start with is the current economic state of the \ncountry, which has made it hard to be a traditional family if you are poor or middle class for at \nleast the past 50 years. This has made it fundamentally difficult for working-class families to \nfollow the traditional model even if they want to. Currently, it is not fiscally possible to support a \nfamily if the man is not making at least the median household income of $80,000 per year. On \nthis same line of thought, housing prices, as a result of a higher amount of inflation and lack of \navailable land in most populated areas, have caused a housing crisis, making it hard, if not \nimpossible, for working-class families to buy a house at a young age. Traditional households \nwere objectively easier and occurred more frequently in the past because families could buy \nproperty at cheaper rates and make more money than they do now. \nAnother simple explanation for the change in society's view on marriage and the \nstructures of families is the overall increase in technology. While having many objectively \npositive effects on society, technology has had some negative consequences, and one of those is \nthe way relationships have changed. With the advent of smartphones and dating apps, there has \nbeen a shift in the way people value the relationships they seek. One study points to the fact that \na large chunk of users on dating apps are just dating casually or hooking up (Vogels & McClain, \n2023). This overall causes a shift away from the traditional values and structures society once \nheld because individuals, especially young people, value the meaning of sex less and do not hold \nlong-term relationships in the same regard. \n\nTechnology has not only changed the way people value relationships and go about \nmeeting potential partners, but it has also changed the way nontraditional families can structure \ntheir families or have kids. A good example of this is things like IVF and surrogacy. Both of \nthese practices make it possible for those who would not qualify under the traditional family \nstructure to raise their own offspring in some way. While there is definitely ethical ambiguity \naround the subject, it still does not take away from the fact that the increase in science and \ntechnology has made it possible for nontraditional families to have children when they could not \nbefore. \nBased on current cultural and political trends, there are several different typical \nhousehold scenarios that may occur or probably will occur in 2035. The biggest one is likely to \nbe the steady increase in dual-income households with shared parenting responsibilities. This is \nalready the majority of households now, and barring any major economic change, the number is \nonly going to increase. Beyond just the financial reasons, culturally, society will probably never \ngo back to limiting women to just the house. Even among conservatives, the idea of women just \nbeing housewives is fading. It is important to note that while the number of households with \ndual-income earners will steadily increase and become the vast majority of marriages, the \nnumber of egalitarian households will probably still be below 50 percent. This is because today, \nonly 29 percent of marriages are egalitarian (Fry et al., 2023). \nAnother household scenario increasing by 2035 is LGBTQIA+ households and \nLGBTQIA+ households with children. Currently, there are more than 2.5 million LGBTQIA+ \nadults parenting children (Williams Institute, 2024). Out of all scenarios, this will undoubtedly \nhave the biggest consequences and pose the greatest challenge to conservatives with traditional \nvalues. Many traditionalists and Christians alike argue the irreparable harm the rise in these \n\nhouseholds will have on not just society, but the children the LGBTQIA+ parents are raising. \nOne study done in 2012 found that children raised in same-sex relationships had more negative \noutcomes as adults compared to those raised by their married biological parents (Eggebeen, \n2012). While this study is fundamentally sound, it is important to note that at the time, there were \nnot many transgender marriages to analyze, so they are not very well represented in the study. \nWhile yes, the research is from 2012, it is almost impossible to find any recent social science \nresearch that is not politically biased. \nIn conclusion, by the year 2035, there will probably be no \"typical\" household structure \noutside of two adults who both work full-time jobs to support their families. This ultimately \nstems from the drastic changes in our economy, culture, and political landscape. For \ntraditionalists who advocate for the nuclear household system, there is still hope. Several bodies \nof research indicate that while religiosity might be going down among the general population, it \nis actually increasing among young people, specifically Gen Z (Hill, 2025). This means that \nmaybe not in 2035, but later down the road, society may see a return to the more traditional \nmodel, and more families will begin adhering to conservative values. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReferences \nEggebeen, D.

        "text": "Kara Penland \nMid-Term Reflection \n \n\u201cA Boy Broken\u201d is more than a story about one family's trauma. It\u2019s a story that reflects \nthe raw depiction of pain, neglect, and resilience, that challenges us to reconsider what it means \nto truly be broken. Before reading the book, I came into this not expecting to gain an \nunderstanding of what trauma means, but after reading this book, it opened my eyes and gave me \na new perspective, not just for trauma in general, but my trauma specifically. I am hoping that \nthrough reading my reflection, it will inspire you not just to read the book, but to learn and \nbroaden your perspective of what a mental illness is and what trauma comes with it. So that we \ncan learn and grow together as a society. A Boy Broken is a story about a family's struggle with \ntrauma as their son, Douglas Engleman Jr is diagnosed with schizophrenia, and how they deal \nwith the grief of losing him after trying to help him get his life back on track after his diagnosis. I \nthink this book was written into three parts as the story of how he and his family dealt with the \ndiagnosis. What does it mean to have a mental illness, the story of a family\u2019s challenges through \na mental illness and how do you deal with the grief of losing someone to a mental illness? I \nknow this sounds broad, but for me this was more than a book, it was a man's strength through \nthe challenging time of finding out his son has a mental illness and how he and his family makes \nthe best of it even after he dies.  \nWhen reading the book, I took it as an emotional guide as a story that we can read and \nlearn from. I started with what is a mental illness, because I felt like this book truly started when \nDouglas Engleman was diagnosed with schizophrenia. That diagnosis did not change his life, but \nalso the people he loved. After being diagnosed it led to a gate being open of what did it mean to \n\nhave the mental illness? How can we help someone that is diagnosed with it? And how is it \ngoing to affect us? I know this last question is like how can we think about us during a time like \nthis but it is human nature to be selfish when it comes to finding out something like this. As a \nfriend or family it can be hard for them to help when they are going through their own issues. As \nI am coming to terms with my diagnosis of my illness. I have seen how these come into play, \nwhen I was around the age 7, my parents were concerned with my focus and lack of attention to \nanything. I know you're thinking that\u2019s normal for a kid, It was with everything I did and that \nwas when they took me to the doctor out of concern for it. At the doctor I was diagnosed with \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  I would say that that definitely was the start \nof my journey, because I was put on my first medicine as a result of that but it was the first time \nthat I truly felt valid as it proved that I was not trying to be disruptive and that I had a reason for \nbeing so hyperactive.  \nThe medicine was a game changer. It did help with me focusing but there were challenges \nthat did arise. In the book we learned that when Douglas Engleman Jr was diagnosed with his \ndisorder, it was not just a change but brought changes for the family with it. As his mom couldn\u2019t \nhelp with taking care of him as she was going through her own challenges. And his dad and wife \ntook on the duty of helping to care for him, but it was hard, as they were starting their family and \nhad one young child and another on the way. I remember that part that hit really hard was when I \nwas reading, when the author asked if it was wrong to be worried, as the son was living with \nthem, and the violent interaction that happened at Melissa's house would happen at his house, \nand would the interaction happen to his wife? It was because of the lack of knowledge at the time \nof the illness, but also due to the fear of the unknown and unpredictability of someone that he \nloved. I think it was one of the biggest challenges that were faced in the book. When looking \n\nback at this part, I started to think of some of the challenges that I faced. I think my biggest \nchallenge was that the ADHD medicine started really well, but it only lasted for a few months \nbefore my body became immune to it, and we started a new medicine. But I had to find the right \ndoses as I needed something strong enough to last for a school day, but not too long, as I had \nreally bad insomnia and had to take melatonin for it. \n I would say that, honestly, that was the end of my mental health story, but as I entered \ncollege and attempted to do new things. I started to get bad anxiety at the thought of going and \ntrying new things, but at that time, I thought it was normal, as we all get anxious. It wasn\u2019t until \nearly 2025, I started to get anxious about everything, from what I was wearing, to what I ate, to \neven going to a place with friends. It didn\u2019t just affect the way I lived, but the way I interacted as \na student, as I was unable to function and had a hard time going to class, interacting with \nteachers, and even turning stuff in. That's when I went to the doctor, and I was diagnosed with \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I would say that is pretty life-changing, as I had never \nthought that I could have another mental illness. As I am starting to come to terms with it, I \nwould say that having the amazing support system of friends and family has helped with it. I \nwould also say that therapy and talking about how it\u2019s okay to make a decision and that I should \nnot feel bad or feel like I made the wrong decision helped. \nI would say that before I conclude this amazing paper, I would say that the biggest part \nand this sums up the book entirely. How do you grieve when losing someone you love, especially \none you have helped and worked hard with their mental illness? I think this was the case for the \nbook, as his family had worked hard and helped him get to a point where he could have achieved \na normal. As I remember that in the book, they mentioned how he was starting to turn his life \nback around. He was going to go back to college, he was starting his treatment and he even \n\nstarted talking to someone. He was making amazing progress, when he was injured in a car \naccident. At this moment changed not just his life, but his family as by the time he made it to the \nhospital he was declared dead. I think it was important as even though it put a hole in his heart, it \nallowed him the opportunity to mend the relationship with his daughter, Melissa. It was also the \nturning point that led to the book that we read but it left me the question what do you do when \nyou lose someone that you love. How do you go on knowing that someone that you cared for \nwill not be there. I one cannot say that I had to deal with it, but one of my favorite influences has \nlost someone they loved through suicide to mental illness, and everyday she post something that \nshe loves about him and how they were supposed to grow old together. I can\u2019t imagine the pain. I \nthink this book also did a really good job of showing it. I am going to give a spoiler but when I \nwas reading the intro, something really hit me. It was the second edition because some people \nasked how Melissa felt and how she handled it. This really stuck out to me that I think this was \nthe chapter I was most excited for. This was a really well written memoir of a family's journey of \ngrief after losing their son. I didn\u2019t just think of it as a book, but something that I can take back \ninto the real world and apply. I think this helped me learn how we can work to educate us on \nmental illness as a whole so that we can not just use them to help as family members and friends \nbut stand up for injustice and help with making decisions that are good for the community as a \nwhole.",

        "text": "Grief is a universally negative experience. However, not all can understand the many \nforms in which grief can manifest itself and implode one\u2019s life, especially when in the context of \ngrieving someone who is still alive. Dr. Douglas Engleman\u2019s articulate and insightful expression \nof his family\u2019s experiences with his son, Doug, who suffered from Schizophrenia in A Boy \nBroken, challenges literal and conventional understandings of grief by presenting both \npsychological loss and physical death as parallels, yet distinct forms of mourning, each \ndemanding its own kind of emotional survival, reluctant acceptance, the redefinition of love, and \nthe attribution of meaning to pain. The book acknowledges two main periods of grief. The first \nbeing when Dr. Engleman initially came to the realization that his son was struggling with \nsymptoms consistent with Schizophrenia, a pivotal point which exposed all of his own stigmas, \nfears, and shame associated with the mental illness. The second wave of grief was experienced \nonce the more literal loss struck his family\u2019s lives, leaving a hole that can never quite be filled as \nwell as the guilt from all the factors that he felt may have contributed to this extremely \ndevastating outcome. \nThe author, Dr. Engleman, describes the transformation of his son\u2019s personality and \nbehavior through the lens of his struggle with his illness. He describes how Doug suddenly began \nto display behaviors inconsistent with the sweet, promising child that Dr. Engleman remembered \nas he watched his son grow up. From the distant and irritable demeanor to the obvious lack of \nself-maintenance, it was apparent that after just a year in college at the Pitsburgh Art Institute he \nhad returned home differently. This loss is described as associated with the relationship, \npersonality, and the norms that were pre-established and maintained throughout the person\u2019s life. \nDr. Engleman breaks down the lifestyle that the family had as Doug was growing up, the \nenvironment, their dynamics, their struggles, and their love. However, he also highlights the \nlayers of anger and guilt he felt from the facts that he internalized as factors in his son\u2019s \n\ndiagnosis. Engleman states, \u201cI was angry at myself for the pain and stress I had contributed to \nDough\u2019s childhood. I was angry with the fact that my family carried the genes that might have \nled to this. I was angry at our God, to who I had prayed so frequently and earnestly for the safety \nand well-being of my family. And I was angry at Doug for whatever substances he may have \nabused that contributed to his condition.\u201d Eventually, this anger and fear turned into acceptance \nand a drive to help his son the best he can. This acceptance marks the acknowledgement of the \nnecessary shift that was made in their relationship and the loss of their old one. With loss, comes \na sense of grief, says Dr. Engleman, and he is referring to the grief of losing his son not to death, \nbut to an illness that distorted the boy he knew. It is a form of mourning without the harsh \nclosure of death called ambiguous grief. \nAmbiguous grief was a key component in their journey, and it both scared and drove \nDouglas Engleman to learn as much as he could to help his son progress past his Schizophrenia. \nAlthough Doug\u2019s body remained present for six years after he was diagnoses, the emotional and \nrelational connection between father and son fractured and required immense efforts on both \nsides to re-establish and revise the dynamic. For Engleman, he felt a complex combination of \nhope and despair with this understanding. He learned as much as he could, starting from the first \nbook he found on how to approach this situation titled \u201cSurviving Schizophrenia: A Family \nManual\u201d by E. Fuller Torrey. Dr. Engelman's pain lies not only in Doug\u2019s deterioration but in the \nhelplessness that comes from watching it unfold, powerless to intervene. What makes this first \nloss so complex and emotionally straining is the duality of Engleman\u2019s roles in this situation as a \nfather and a trained psychiatrist. The knowledge and capacity for knowledge that shoud serve as \na tool in helping him understand his son\u2019s behavior instead deepens his anguish. His professional \noutlook craves a clear explanation and plan of solution but as a father, he expresses to readers \nhow difficult it is to overcome the emotional aspects of the situation. When someone you love \n\nbecomes ill in a way that alters their mind, the loss feels both invisible and unending. Engelman \nis forced to grieve without the finality that death provides, to live with a son who is present in \nbody but unreachable in essence. \nIn contrast to ambiguous grief, true loss of a loved one feels much less invisible, much \nmore \u201cvalid\u201d to feel in a sense. Because Dr. Engleman has had to unfortunately experience two \nof the most agonizing things a parent can go through, he understands the parallels as well as the \ndualism between loss and death. He mentions how \u201cOften, our experience of loss and grief is not \nrecognized or validated by society.\u201d He goes on to say how the loss of a person\u2019s identity and \nprojected life is not perceived nor empathized by society as it would be for the death of a person \nor child. I agree with this statement very strongly. I think the stigmas and shame we associate \nwith mental illness from within and outside of the situation personally all negatively affect the \nresources available to survivors or those struggling with mental health. Therefore, as Engleman \naddresses, the loss of a child to mental illness is invalidated in many ways and undermined in \nterms of the damage and struggle it can cause not only the person, but the entire family who is \ntrying to help support their loved one, especially when in comparison to death. In a really tragic \nmanner, I interpreted Dr. Douglas Engleman\u2019s recount of his raw emotions at this point of loss to \nreflect a sense of closure. This closure obviously does not take away from the gut-wrenching \npain and sorrow of losing a child; nothing could. However, I do find beauty in forcing yourself to \nrelieve the sadness and pain by writing about it in hopes of healing and helping others who may \nbe able to resonate with the experiences, mistakes, and advice in this book, which is exactly the \nreason Dr. Engleman wrote it. \nThrough this final, devastating loss of his son, I believe Dr. Engleman comes to \nrecognize that grief is not something to be conquered but something that you live alongside. \nAfter years of struggling with Doug\u2019s illness and the limitations it caused, Dr. Engleman, by \n\nforced outcome or by painful maturity, has learned to navigate a kind of suspended mourning. \nHe grieved the child he knew in so many periods and so many forms, with unwavering love \nthrough it all. When Doug\u2019s life was cut short by the accident, that suspended grief fell into the \nperfect mold of permanence. Although the pain in this is apparent, the finality may offer a \nversion of cruel peace no longer wondering and hoping. Personally, I think this distinction \nbetween ongoing and final losses is what makes Engelman\u2019s story so human. The slow, ongoing \nkind of loss, like watching someone fade into mental illness, is harder for many to live with \nbecause it never resolves. It asks you to keep loving someone who may not be able to love \nthemselves or you back in the same way. Final loss, for all its brutality, at least ends the waiting. \nThere\u2019s pain, but also clarity. In Engelman\u2019s case, death did not erase his grief; it simply \ntransformed it from a storm into a silence. That silence becomes the space where he finally \nbegins to understand himself not just as a father or a doctor, but as a man learning how to live \nafter love\u2019s hardest test. \nIn \u201cA Boy Broken\u201d, Engelman\u2019s story is not simply about a father losing his son, twice, \nfirst to mental illness and then to death, but about what it means to keep living when love is no \nlonger reciprocated in familiar ways. His journey forces the reader to confront the nature of loss \nas something that demands more than emotional endurance; it requires acceptance, surrender, \nand transformation. Engelman\u2019s strength lies not in his ability to overcome grief, but in his \nwillingness to be changed by it, to let it redefine what connection and compassion mean. Both \nforms of loss test his humanity, but they also refine it. By sharing his most painful truths, \nEngelman gives language to a kind of love that persists through powerlessness. His reflections \nremind us that grief is not the opposite of love, but its final, most honest expression. In learning \nto carry both sorrow and gratitude at once, Engelman reveals that healing is not the return of \nwhat was lost, but the rediscovery of oneself in the aftermath.",

        "text": "Sophia Soares \nIssues in Social Justice \nCRM/SOC 250 \nDr. Engleman \n20 September 2025 \nReflection Paper 1 \n\u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d by Micheal J. Sandel is an exploration into the \nmoral questions people ask today and have been asking throughout history. Sandel provides \nphilosophical and historical context to modern questions while outlining different philosophies \nand theories.  \n The book starts out by delving into what doing the right thing is. It defines justice and \nhow different that can look within a society. Justice can look like maximizing welfare, respecting \nfreedom, and promoting virtue.  Personally, before reading this book I would have defined \njustice as everybody being treated fairly and having that idea enforced by the Criminal Justice \nSystem. To me, that meant if somebody did something bad, they would be punished. And if \nsomebody was mistreated or worked hard they should receive a subsequent reward or help.  Price \ngouging is important, because our criminal justice system operates largely based on the fact that \nwe are in a capitalistic society. The markets let people choose for themselves what value to place \non the things they exchange, this gives people freedom to prioritize the products they want as a \nsociety.  More on capitalism, in the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 there was outrage about \nbailout injustice. Wall Street was raking in a lot of profit until this financial crisis, and the \ngovernment decided that taxpayers money would start to go towards giving money to bigger \ncompanies during this hard financial time. I understand that this was meant to incentivize the \n\neconomy and keep things working in the world like normal. But to regular taxpayers this felt \nunfair because they were working just as hard, if not harder, than the workers at these big \ncompanies but not receiving the same payouts. I think often in government misinformation and \nlack of choice is what frustrates people the most.  But it raises an essential question on if people \nwould act in the name of the greater good, even if they knew it didn't immediately benefit them. \n More moral dilemmas were brought up in chapter one. The Runaway Trolley question \nwas posed: if you would switch the tracks on a running trolley to kill one worker instead of five. \nMost people would switch the track to save the five but when presented with the question on if \nthey would push a random bystander into the track to save the five they hesitate more. I \nunderstand this completely because if you are on that trolley and switch the track there is still \nreasonable doubt that it will actually kill the one person it is hurtling towards, on the other hand \nif you act directly not only are people more likely to feel guilty but if you push somebody into \nthe tracks you know for certain you were killing this person immediately.  There is one more \nthought experiment where a special forces team of four US Navy Seals were on a mission in \nAfghanistan  near the Pakistan Border in search of the Taliban when they came across two \nAfghan goat herders and didn't know whether to release them, at the risk of them informing the \nTaliban. The SEALs voted and released the goat herders, who in turn told the Taliban who came \nand killed four out of the five of the SEALS.  This was a hard debate for me to come to terms \nwith, because I see the necessity of killing the goat herders because they were in the middle of \nthe war and needed to protect themselves. But,  I would personally think that there would have to \nbe some other way to restrain, injure, or keep the goat herders prisoners without killing them or \njust releasing them at the  detriment of the SEALs.  \n\n Chapter 2 focuses on utilitarianism, which is the principle of maximizing happiness for \nthe overall balance of pleasure as opposed to pain. The first contextualization of this is of four \nEnglish Sailors that ate their cabin boy to survive the time on end with no food and no news of \nrescue. Under Jeremy Bentham's  principle of utilitarianism the judge would have found the \nsailors not guilty, but there's an important argument of seeing people for their own worth and not \njust as a means to an end. More examples of utilitarianism include rounding up beggars to \nincrease the happiness of the general public. Another example is torture in the name of helping \nmore people who might be at risk if the prisoner doesn\u2019t reveal their plans. Both of these \nexamples prioritize the happiness of the many, over the needs of the few. My main argument \nwith these actions is that they disregard people's  individual  rights.  I think that even with the \nbenefit of an entirely perfect society, the downfall of having one child below it: neglected and \nmalnourished, would not be worth the cost because the  general public are living in ignorance. I \nam a big proponent of the idea that everybody should be informed of the decisions they're \nmaking and consensual about it. My support for knowledge and consent goes for the beggars and \nthe torture example as well, the general public that the government is protecting at these times is \nnot consenting to these actions so I think that they are unjust despite the utilitarianism principle. \n Chapter 3 delves into libertarianism and economic inequality. Libertarianism supports \nunfettered markets and opposes government interference. Sandel brings up the question of taxing \nbillionaires who can't spend money within their lifetime. Under libertarianism this would not be \nsupported because rich people, Michael Jordan for example, worked really hard to earn their \nmoney. I support the idea of taxing and having wealth caps on the 1% and higher upper class \nbecause not only can they not spend their money within their lifetime but I think that there are \nother motivating factors for innovation. If the argument is that with wealth caps and taxes the \n\nrich won't be motivated to innovate, I argue that it will give space for new innovators. I also \nthink that there are other non-financial benefits to innovating: like fame and social motivation. \nLibertarianism also supports the idea of owning yourself, therefore since you own your body you \nshould be allowed to sell your organs like kidneys. This supports the idea of assisted suicide as \nwell, but I think this idea of libertarianism should only morally be supported as well as the \nindividual isn\u2019t a risk to themselves and others.  \nPutting a price on people has been a big question throughout history. The main question \nraised is if people should be allowed to pay for substitutions to being conscripted. I feel that it \ncould still be partly moral to get out of conscription by presenting another volunteer, even if that \nvolunteer is paid, because not only is the need of a soldier filled but there are valid reasons and \npeople who have responsibilities that should have another option other than forced consciption. \nAlthough, if we allow conscription to turn into something that only the wealthy can get out of \nthen obviously everybody would agree that\u2019s unfair. Even with a volunteer army it is unfair \nbecause it will be attracting those with less opportunities and privilege to join the army and risk \ntheir lives just for the benefits. On a different note, should people be able to pay for pregnancy \nthrough surrogacy?  I think that with the right contracts that surrogacy can be seen as a business \narrangement. As with other business dealing, people\u2019s individual rights need to be protected and \nthere need to be protections in place for the surrogate should the pregnancy become dangerous. \nBut, if a surrogate signs a contract, gives birth and then decides she wants to keep the baby and \nthinks it's her right I would argue that it is not because of the contract that she signed. \n Another important philosopher is Immanuel Kant, who believes humans are people \nworthy of respect and not just members of the public to be used. He is against the utilitarian idea \nthat just because it gives many people pleasure means it's right. Kant thinks humans are rational \n\nbeings that avoid pain. I found his idea of \u201cheteronomous determinism\u201d really interesting, that \nwe all do everything for the sake of the purposes we pursue. I think I really resonate with this, \nalthough I feel like in my personal day-to-day life I will do a lot of small things for simple  \nreasons like being happy. In the main scale of my life I think most of my long-term decisions are \nbased on pursuing a certain future, and even while performing small tasks every day I will \nconsider the future and not make decisions that would negatively impact it.  Kant believes that \nactions should be judged by intent and not the consequences, posing the idea that it is wrong to \nlie even to a murderer to save a friend. Although I agreed with Kant before, I do not agree with \nthis line of reasoning. I think that when people are in danger or at risk, the need to protect life \noverweighs the need to be truthful. Kant also only believes that people are only free when their \nwill is determined anonymously, because otherwise they don't choose their desires. I think that \nalthough humans are very influenced by their environment, we each do consciously choose our \nown desires or at the very least to act on them, and therefore I think we are free while we are \npursuing them.  \n\u200b\nJohn Rawl\u2019s social contract is that the less privileged in society should benefit from any \neconomic and social inequalities. He poses the idea of the veil of ignorance in which everybody \nis unaware of their role in society and has to design a new society not knowing their own place in \nit. I think that John Rawls had a great idea with this thought experiment, and that if it was able to \nbe played out we would have a much more just society. But, I am skeptical that the perfect \nsociety would last, because it is really hard to make and keep everybody equal because of \npeople's different biology and interests there will always be changing social and power \ndynamics.  Rawls also thinks that talent and hard work do not necessarily deserve reward, and \nthat justice is just a means of keeping the rules and social obligations in place. I agree because it \n\nis nobody's right to be rewarded for their work, but that does not mean that they should not \ncontinue working for the sake of a functioning society. The more people working and \nfunctioning in society, the more chances of people being rewarded for their work in turn.  \n\u200b\nChapter 7 delves into affirmative action, specifically in universities. Sandel argues that it \nis nobody's right to be admitted to colleges, and universities should be free to discriminate if \ntheir choices of acceptance are aligned with their values and purpose as a university. Although I \nagree with this basic reasoning,  I think that correcting for the test gap and the history of many \nyears of different opportunities given to people because of discrimination, racism, and situations \nbeyond their control is important. The redlining of our past and the systematic racism that still \nexists because of it makes affirmative action important to give minorities and underprivileged \nmore opportunities. Aristotle believed strongly in rational thought and \u201ctelos\u201d, which is the \nsearch of finding the purpose of things so they can be properly valued for their nature and \npeople can figure out what to do with them.  I think Aristotle's reasoning pairs well with \nour modern day idea of capitalism, and ties back into how the book first introduced the \nidea of our markets that allow our general population to influence the value of items.  \nIn Chapter 9, Sandel explores questions of reparations, government neutrality, and \nmoral responsibility in the eyes of differing philosophers.  Aristotle believed the purpose \nof government is to form good citizens, while Kant and Rawls argued that people act for \nthemselves and therefore need a framework of laws to guide them. Sandel distinguishes \nbetween voluntary obligations, which require consent, and natural duties or obligations of \nsolidarity, which do not. He also raises the issue of patriotism, asking whether it is blind \nobedience or a justified pride in one\u2019s country despite its flaws, and considers whether \nactions like a man patiently guarding a border are virtuous. Chapter 10 continues these \n\nthemes, questioning whether true neutrality in government is possible and whether \nreligion should play a role in politics. I think that everybody has views on different laws, \nand there is no way to exclude your morals from these views. On that same note, not being \nreligious myself, I think that it is hard for people to separate their morality and their \nreligion. So although I think that the government should not enforce any religion or \nrestrict people's ability to freely practice their own religion, I do not think it's fair to ask \npoliticians to completely keep religion out of their reasoning. \n \n \nReferences \nSandel, Michael J.

        "text": "Karsten Heimel \nDr. Engelman \nSOC 250 \n9/19/25 \nReflection One \n\u200b\nMichael Joseph Sandel is an American author and Harvard professor who teaches \npolitical philosophy. His book, \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d illustrates the ideas of \nprevious philosophers while discussing real-world dilemmas that still occur today. Michael \nSandel displays these philosophies as theories and examples that prove how they are relevant in \ntoday\u2019s world. Sandel drew on philosophers such as Rawls, Kant, and Aristotle to develop the \nexamples and theories. Because Sandel illustrates these theories in simple examples, he allows \nreaders to think critically about fairness, rights, and the good for all. Sandel pushes the reader to \nnot only think about what actions people choose, but also why they make them.  \n\u200b\nMichael Sandel addresses the philosopher John Rawls in his book, \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the \nRight Thing to Do.\u201d Rawls was a philosopher who lived from 1921 to 2002. He is famous for his \nveil of ignorance concept, as well as theories of justice being fair. Rawls developed a theory of \nfairness as an alternative to libertarianism and utilitarianism. It created a sense of justice whilst \navoiding the downsides of the other viewpoints. Utilitarianism risks the rights of the individual \nwhilst allowing society to be equal. Libertarianism ignores the rights of the community and \ncreates inequality so it can protect the rights of an individual. Rawls\u2019 concept allows us to use \nboth parts of the ideologies to help create a better society. Rawls talks about a hypothetical called \nThe Original Position, where we are asked to design a society where we have to think about \njustice in a fair way. Personally, I come from a nice background where I have been blessed with \n\nHeimel 2 \nthe opportunity to attend college. If I were to design a society right now, I would have a bias for \npeople like me; if I were asked to design a society later in life, I would have a bias for wherever I \nam. If I were retiring, I would be biased and not want to be taxed more on my retirement fund, \ndespite it being for my community. Thankfully, the hypothetical includes the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d \nwhere I do not know my own role in society. It eliminates my bias because I have no clue the \nstage in life I am at, which allows me to account for all people in society. It creates a strong sense \nof justice and fairness that would otherwise not be there because of my bias. Sandel addresses \nthe reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, but I still feel like I would have bias towards myself; \nI think it is a part of basic human nature to be biased, and I do not know how I would completely \neliminate it. If I did not know my place in society, how would my choices about fairness differ \nfrom where I am now? Rawls uses two principles of justice: equal basic liberties and the \ndifference principle.  His equal basic liberties state that every person should have the same \nfundamental freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, and \nprotection under the law. These certain liberties cannot be traded away for social benefits. I agree \nwith this because they are some of the most important liberties in our country, and they should \nnever be sacrificed. Rawls uses his difference principle, which states that any inequalities in \nwealth, power, and opportunity are only just if they also improve the positions of those in the \nlowest advantaged part of society. I also agree on this principle because it allows society to be \njust. It would not be fair at all for someone to be handed an advantage that only they can use and \nnot all of society. Rawls directly goes against utilitarianism, which tries to maximize people\u2019s \nhappiness and will sacrifice people\u2019s rights to do so.  Rawls argues that justice must respect \npeople equally, which I agree with fully. I think that Rawls creates a nice balance between \nlibertarianism and utilitarianism. When either one of the ideologies is used solely, I think it \n\nHeimel 3 \ncreates a radical society that can never really exist. It creates such an unjust society that it either \nonly focuses on an individual or only focuses on the maximization of happiness.  \n\u200b\nMichael Sandel also addresses the philosopher Immanuel Kant in his book, \u201cJustice: \nWhat\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d Kant was an eighteenth-century German philosopher who \ninfluenced Western philosophy. Sandel includes Kant in his book because of his alternative to \nutilitarianism. Kant wanted to have morality be from duty and reason instead of being from \nconsequence. He argued that morality should come from principles, and rational beings should \nrecognize and follow them. I think that Kant takes his philosophy too far because he focuses so \nhard on being absolute that he never looks at the outcomes. He looks too hard at the motives \nrather than the consequences. I do like how Kant\u2019s ideas are about acting morally while also \nbeing free. He talks about how being free does not mean you can do whatever you want; true \nfreedom means that you follow moral laws. In principle, I think this is a good idea, but it can \nnever be accomplished. People are inherently bad, so there is no point in following this code. \nPeople will exploit and cheat the system. Sandel highlights Kant\u2019s principle in two key points: \nUniversal Law and Humanity. With Universal Law, you should only act in accordance with laws \nthat are always true. So, according to Kant, even when you lie about something that almost \nanyone would lie about, it is still morally wrong. This part is where I disagree heavily; I think \nKant takes the principle way too far. I do like Kant for his view on utilitarianism. I think he \npoints out the flaws very well and displays how you should not be using others as a tool for \nsomeone else\u2019s happiness. Kant emphasizes rights, dignity, and moral duty, which later \ninfluenced Rawls\u2019 thinking. I think that I prefer Rawls much more because it is not as radical as \nKant. \n\nHeimel 4 \n\u200b\nMichael Sandel uses Aristotle in his book to talk about telos. Aristotle\u2019s stance on telos is \nthat it is a virtue. He argues that to determine what is just, we must understand the purpose of \nwhat we are talking about. I like Aristotle\u2019s stance on this, but I do not think he takes into \nconsideration those who come from an unfortunate background. If the best flute player should \nget the best flute, then how is anyone supposed to improve? If I had no access to any good \nbasketballs or basketball courts, how would I have any chance at going pro? Aristotle also talks \nabout human beings needing to be a part of a community, and the only justice that can be \ninterpreted is the common good. He says that justice is about aligning social roles and rewards \nwith the deeper ends of human beings. I think that Aristotle is somewhat right about justice only \nbeing the common good; we can interpret what the common good is, but we should also look to \nhelp others in society, even if it does not benefit society as a whole.  Sandel frames Aristotle as a \ncommunitarian, but I disagree with this take. I feel like Aristotle only looks at the best people in \neach society and does not focus on the impoverished or less advantaged people in society. I do \nagree with the framework that Sandel uses on Aristotle\u2019s principle of same-sex marriage. I think \nthat at the core of same-sex marriage, people are marrying each other to love and support one \nanother, and that is their basic human right. It is odd to see this view coming from a far different \ntime, and I understand that it was not traditional for this to occur in ancient Greece. I also like \nhow Sandel uses the framework to address golf handicaps. I personally play it for fun, so I do \nplay with extra strokes. If I were to play to win the game, I would play without the strokes so I \nhave the same advantage as everyone. I like how he looks at how we approach the subject, and \nhe does that better than other philosophers.  \n\u200b\nI really enjoyed reading the book and gaining perspective on each viewpoint. I think I fall \nin the middle between libertarian and utilitarian. I want to help make society more even, but not \n\nHeimel 5 \nsacrifice individuals\u2019 rights. I think that Rawls is the philosopher I relate to the most out of the \nthree because he also talks about evening society. The veil of ignorance creates a great \nhypothetical where people have to come to terms with how uneven societies are. I think that I \nheavily disagree with Kant because he emphasizes individuals\u2019 freedoms far more than they \nshould be. He would rather someone suffer than take money out of someone's pocket. He focuses \nway too much on morals, and that could never happen in a society. Aristotle has an interesting \ntake where he focuses on the meaning behind the action. I kind of like his take but I feel like he \ndoes not look at all of society.",

        "text": "Charlotte Thorne \nSOC 250 \nDr. Engelman \n9/19/25 \nReflection on Justice \nAs a fourth-year Philosophy student, I have learned of J.S. Mill\u2019s utilitarianism, \nlibertarianism, Immanuel Kant\u2019s ethics and categorical imperatives, Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics, and \nthe general ideals of ethical justice.  I am a young woman in America who is a media consumer \nand has experience in Political Science courses.  What I have yet to do is plainly lay out how my \nphilosophical views align with my social and political views outside of the connections I make in \nmy head, and that is what I plan to use this reflection paper for. \nI found it unexpectedly hard to read and discuss utilitarianism and libertarianism in a way \nthat is solely sociological and political rather than first discussing them in a philosophical sense \nand making my own connections to those disciplines.  It made me realize that maybe I make it \nharder on myself to learn and draw connections with these topics because of this sense that I \nmust first understand the philosophy of the thinker or the ideals.  I personally think in a way that \npulls from the philosophies of happiness and ethics so that is the lens through which I will be \nrecollecting my thoughts on Michael J. Sandel\u2019s Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? \nStripped bare, utilitarianism is the idea of acting in a way that causes the most happiness \nfor the most people.  In the same vein, libertarianism is the idea that as humans, we have the \nright to do whatever we want as long as we respect that other people also have the right to do \nwhatever they want.  I personally started reading as being most familiar with J.S. Mill\u2019s view on \n\nutilitarianism, less on Bentham.  Bentham focuses on the \u201cutility\u201d part of utilitarianism, which of \ncourse would seem to be the focus.  Pain and pleasure are our \u201csovereign masters.\u201d  Mill tries to \nreign the \u201cutility\u201d of Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism back into how we can make it work for the \nindividual.  Mill says, \u201cover himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\u201d  \nThe contrast between pain and pleasure being sovereign versus the individual being sovereign \nmight seem to be a fine line but no worries, Mill, like many philosophers I know, likes to explain \nin much, much detail... \nWhile rejecting Bentham\u2019s take, Mill explains that focusing on the individual is, in fact, \nstill prioritizing the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.  Bentham, to me as a \nMill-reader, focuses on a large-scale system.  He tells us that politicians should be asking \nthemselves about what legislation will be best for the greatest number of people.  Mill says we \ncan focus more effectively on the individual rather than these larger systems like the government \nof societies.  Sandel even says \u201cBentham\u2019s argument for the principle that we should maximize \nutility takes the form of a bold assertion.\u201d \nThis is why I agree with Mill on having to reject Bentham\u2019s take on the principle.  Over \ntime, Mill argues, as Sandel puts it, \u201crespecting individual liberty will lead to the greatest human \nhappiness.\u201d  This is what I rest my ideals of utilitarianism on.  Like the nerd I am, one of my \nfavorite quotes is from feminist scholar Margaret Mead and I first heard it on my favorite show, \nAaron Sorkin\u2019s The West Wing.  \u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed \ncitizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\u201d  My philosophical \nstudies have revolved around ethics and that one quote is one that I think of constantly.  Not only \nis it empowering but it is proved to be true by history time and time again.  The main idea of \nutilitarianism being to act in a way that causes the most happiness for the most people is \n\nsomething that is rooted deeply into a lot of different areas and ideals of ethics, whether stated or \nnot.   \nSomething I\u2019ve learned is that it is near to impossible to be a modern person and agree \nwholeheartedly with everything one philosopher or one theory ever upholds.  Most philosophies \nthat are the building blocks of society today were formed at least hundreds of years ago.  To not \nonly survive but be moral and happy in modern society, not one of these theories will be fully \naccurate to what you need or believe you need.  I am not a utilitarian, and I am not a libertarian.  \nAnd yet, as archaic as these terms can be, they still are, as I said, the building blocks of modern \nsociety.  I\u2019ve been trying to reflect on why that is.  Yes, it is hard for anything not made in \nmodern times to be fit for modern standards but there has got to be more to it than that... \n\u201cJustice and the common good\u201d is a phrase used over and over, let alone being a whole \nchapter in Sandel\u2019s book.  I\u2019ve been wondering why \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201ccommon good\u201d are put \ntogether so often.  The thing is, politics today is seemingly supposed to be surrounded by these \nideas.  That justice and common good are what drive legislation, economy, civics, and all aspects \nof any sort of democratic society.  As Sandel puts it, our challenge is to \u201cimagine a politics that \ntakes moral and spiritual questions seriously.\u201d  We all want our personal beliefs and experiences \nto be heard and put into consideration when politicians are making decisions because we each \nare individuals and must work ourselves to make sure our society works for ourselves as \nindividuals.  What makes it harder is also that which makes it clearer; we all have various \npersonal needs and beliefs.  It is good and bad in a society.  As Sandel points out, \u201csociety \nrequires a strong sense of community.\u201d \nSomething I found interesting about what Sandel says a little later is how Kennedy \nmanaged to invoke Americans\u2019 pride in America while simultaneously appealing to their sense \n\nof community.  Even though that specific speech he references may be seen as Kennedy being \nable to separate his personal preoccupations from his point about the injustices he mentions, \nSandel knows that isn\u2019t true and I agree with him.  Even drawing back to Mill\u2019s sense that the \nindividual level is just as important if not more important than the whole, I believed before \nreading Justice and even more now that the individual cannot separate their personal beliefs from \nwhat they bring to society and into every speech and decision.  But is this not what people hate \nabout politicians?  Their ability to appeal to the whole while also keeping their personal beliefs \non track with all the work they do?  Is that not the work of a politician in the structure of modern \nsociety that these old philosophers helped build?   \nA one of the things Immanuel Kant is most known for believing is that humans are not \nends in themselves.  According to Kant, an \u201cend\u201d is something that is valuable all on its own but \na \u201cmeans\u201d to an end is just that: something that is used to achieve that end.  Philosophically, \nsomething unique just to human beings is that we have rational thought.  That is the difference \nbetween humans and animals plainly, that we have rational thought while animals and non-living \nthings cannot possibly possess that.  That is the main argument for why humans must be seen as \nends and not means, let alone because they deserve it morally.  I agree with this aspect of \nKantian philosophy.  In this sense, as Sandel explains, I am not a utilitarian because a utilitarian \nwould treat others as a means to the end of collective happiness.  So how, if individuals are how \ncommunity is made, are we not supposed to use humans as a means to make things better for \neveryone?  How am I supposed to want universal human rights while simultaneously not using \nhumans as a reason to get there? \nWe had a discussion in class one day, and it was mentioned that Kant likes to contradict \nhimself.  At the time, knowing the Kantian philosophies I know, I disagreed.  But after reading \nthe rest of Sandel\u2019s Justice, I might just believe it.  If Kant is one of the many great philosophical \n\nthinkers whose ideas contributed to how society works today, then how is it that the way society \nworks today feels so contradictory to the idea that happiness is the ultimate goal?  It is not just \nKant that contradicts himself, it is every philosopher.  It proves just what I was thinking before, \nthat it is nearly impossible to agree fully with everything one philosopher or one ideology \npurports.  So again, it is hard for anything not made in modern times to be fit for modern \nstandards, but are the things made in modern times even exclusively made from modern thought?  \nIs there a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d of sorts for ideas for systems of modern society where we can \nabandon what older philosophers have said that influenced modern societal systems?  As a \nphilosophy major, I grapple with this often; the question of if I can trust philosophers as far back \nas the Enlightenment period to have theories that still work today.  We don\u2019t question it.  We \ndon\u2019t question that philosophers a lot of people have never heard of are actually huge sources of \ninspiration for modern America.  The morality of last century isn\u2019t always going to work in this \nday and age.  Never before has the world had such advanced technology that we have today, let \nalone social media as a whole.  These are the many things I am grappling with in this course, in \nmy academic career, and in my journey of being educated in politics and social issues.",

        "text": "1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Future of Families in America \n  \nOlga Romero Zelaya \nDepartment of Criminology and Sociology, University of North Carolina Wilmington \nSOC 345: Sociology of the Family \nDr. Engelman \nOctober 24, 2025 \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2\n \n \n \nThe Future of Families in America \nThe \u201cnuclear family\u201d has long been portrayed in movies and media as the traditional \nhousehold structure: a heterosexual couple raising their children. Men were the \u201cbreadwinners,\u201d \nwhile women took on domestic and caregiving responsibilities. These gender roles began to shift \nin the 1960s and 1970s as expectations slowly evolved. Since then, a variety of social, political, \nand cultural forces have shaped family dynamics. Today, there is growing concern about what \nthe future holds for families given society\u2019s new technological advancements and rapidly \nchanging policies. For this reason, it is imperative more than ever to examine how families are \nevolving in real time and what outcomes we should be preparing for in the years ahead. \nFor much of U.S. history, couples were expected to marry before moving in together or \nhaving children. Today, marriage is no longer the baseline for building a life with a partner. In \nfact, in 2024, U.S. adults were less likely to be married than at almost any point since the Census \nBureau began tracking marriage trends in 1940. Since 2020, fewer than half of American \nhouseholds have included a married couple (USAFacts, 2025). Additionally, 78% of adults ages \n18\u201329 said it is acceptable for an unmarried couple to live together, even if they do not plan to \nmarry (Pew Research Center, 2019). While this data shows a decline in marriage rates, it does \nnot mean that people no longer pursue relationships or believe in love. Instead, it reflects a shift \nin how couples are choosing to build their partnerships. \nAn increasing number of couples are choosing cohabitation, where they live together \ndespite not being married. Some view it as a \u201ctesting phase\u201d to see whether they can successfully \nbuild a life together as husband and wife, while others choose cohabitation for financial reasons. \nOne of the biggest conflicts with marriage is the cost of weddings. According to Chertoff and \nDarling (2025), the average wedding in 2025 is approximately $36,000, with modest celebrations \n\n \n3\n \n \n \ncosting around $10,000. Society has normalized high wedding expenses, emphasizing the need \nfor a long list of services\u2014photographers, videographers, entertainment, beauty professionals, \nand more. In contrast, cohabitation can relieve financial pressure by allowing partners to share \nrent, utilities, and other living expenses (Center for Relationship and Sexual Wellness, 2024). \nAdditionally, some couples simply view marriage as a legal formality and see no reason to spend \nthousands of dollars just to be bound to someone on paper. \nSocial media has significantly changed family dynamics because of how accessible it has \nbecome. Seeking advice from strangers has become the new norm. Information about sexual \nhealth can be accessed within seconds, helping people make more informed decisions and \nprevent unplanned pregnancies. Parents sending their children off to college are joining \nFacebook groups to share information, discuss campus issues, and seek advice on supporting \ntheir children. There are countless podcasts, YouTube videos, and articles that share stories from \nwomen navigating parenting challenges, even from people with the same cultural background \nand values. Women are reading about postpartum depression and finding advice on how to \nhandle these challenges without letting it affect their relationships. While all of this inclusive \ncontent can be enriching for many, strangers now have the power to quickly influence decisions \nabout relationships, parenting, and even marriage.  \nThe dating realm has also completely transformed with the use of media as a whole.   \nAccording to Curry (2025), over 350 million people use dating apps worldwide in 2025. \nNowadays, a connection can begin from something as simple as replying to an Instagram story, \nallowing people from different countries to interact who otherwise would have never crossed \npaths. However, the evolution of technology has also changed intimacy in unsettling ways. \nArtificial intelligence has reshaped human connections through apps that allow people to \n\n \n4\n \n \n \ngenerate personalized deepfake pornography. In January 2024, explicit AI-generated content of \npop star Taylor Swift spread to millions before being removed (Berger, 2024). Many public \nfigures have already had to deal with these violations, but it can also target ordinary individuals \nyou encounter in everyday life. Technology now has the power to simulate emotional, visual, \nand sexual connections, and it raises alarming concerns. If people can satisfy their desires \nthrough screens, could that be contributing to declining birth rates? Many may no longer feel the \nneed to go out and \u201cexplore the market\u201d when they can customize their experiences from the \ncomfort of their own homes and devices. \nFor generations, boys have been told to be strong, hide their emotions, and avoid \nvulnerability. As a result, they often grow up not knowing how to process or express their \nfeelings and cannot show up in the way they are needed. Fortunately, there has been a shift in \nthis narrative. The mental health landscape has become increasingly inclusive, with therapists \nwho specialize in specific identities, including different ethnicities, religions, genders, and \nLGBTQ+ communities. Social media has given adolescents access to stories from strangers who \nshare their experiences of being silenced emotionally, reaffirming that it is okay to seek help \nfrom mentors or counselors. The internet has also made it easier than ever to find a therapist in \nseconds, and as parents share skills and strategies online, ideas about masculinity are changing \nrapidly. \nThese generations are actively unlearning the toxic masculinity that equates emotional \nsuppression with strength. Many men were never given the cultural permission or supportive \nplatforms needed to challenge these expectations and develop into emotionally present partners \nand fathers. Men and boys are being welcomed into emotional spaces that were previously \nunavailable to them. As a result, I believe we will see men take on more household and \n\n \n5\n \n \n \ncaregiving roles in the coming years. I think we will also see more egalitarian relationships, with \nboth partners contributing equally, although their definitions of equality may differ. However, I \nam curious about what new forms of parenting will emerge as men become more emotionally in \ntune with themselves. \nWomen are also being encouraged to take action in their own lives. Professionally, they \nare told to pursue higher education and become, as some social media users say, \u201cdisgustingly \neducated.\u201d In my search, I found hundreds of TikTok videos with captions like, \u201cThe feminine \nurge to be disgustingly over-educated\u201d (Pamela, 2025). One comment read, \u201cThis over marriage \nand kids any day,\u201d with hundreds of likes agreeing. On a personal level, women are urging other \nwomen online to reconsider motherhood, with some even posting why they regret having \nchildren to educate others. For example, TikTok creator @kelleydaring, who has over 217,000 \nfollowers and more than 6.1 million likes, shares hundreds of stories from women and men who \nregret having children and use her platform to encourage others to think carefully before starting \na family. Content about birth experiences and postpartum realities is also reaching massive \naudiences, reshaping perceptions of the intense physical and emotional strain that parenting can \ninvolve. \nFinally, today\u2019s political landscape is one of the most influential factors shaping \ndecisions about whether to start a family\u2014and for those who already have children, it raises \nurgent questions about how new Trump Administration policies will affect their stability and \nwell-being. One recent example is the administration\u2019s decision to fire dozens of staff members \nresponsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding, whose work ensured \nthat states provided services to 7.5 million children with disabilities (Turner, 2025). This \n\n \n6\n \n \n \ndecision has left many families worried about their children\u2019s educational support and long-term \nopportunities.  \nEarlier this year, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" introduced new federal student loan limits \nthat will take effect on July 1, 2026. Graduate students will now have an annual borrowing limit \nof $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000. Medical and law students will have an annual limit \nof $50,000 and a lifetime limit of $250,000 (Curry, 2025). These restrictions have sparked \nwidespread backlash, as they will affect millions of people's access to higher education, \nparticularly those from low-income backgrounds. Many fear that the insufficient borrowing \ncapacity will hinder their ability to pursue the education they hoped would help them break their \nfamilies' cycle of poverty. This situation may also influence their decision to start a family, as \nthey might feel discouraged from having children due to their limited income and lack of \neducation. \nNegron (2025) released a report in September 2023, sharing statistics about American \nhouseholds and the impact of the current administration. The report indicates a $2,400 decrease \nin short-run average income per household, an increase of $400 in the cost of financing a new \ncar, and a 13% average revenue loss for typical small businesses. These pressures are creating \ngrowing tension within families and relationships. While support services exist for couples \nexperiencing stress, many cannot afford the cost or the time required to seek help, contributing to \na cycle of ongoing strain. If these patterns continue, relationship dissatisfaction and divorce rates \nmay rise, affecting future generations who grow up in high-stress households. In the past, staying \ntogether was often seen as the selfless choice for the children, but with today\u2019s housing and \neconomic market, having two households is no longer as feasible as it once was\u2014even for dual-\nearner couples. \n\n \n7\n \n \n \nIn our class, students have expressed frustration that men do not take on enough \nhousehold responsibilities, and that frustration is progress in itself. Future generations of mothers \nhave made it clear, both online and in person, that they will not accept a dynamic where men \nonly earn the income while women handle most of the other duties. However, the political \nclimate in the United States takes far more precedence right now than conversations about future \nfamily and partner dynamics. I find it incredibly difficult to predict what society will look like in \na decade, but seeing people respond to new policies gives me hope, along with millions of \nothers. People are actively fighting for what they believe in, and the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest on \nOctober 18, 2025, is evidence of that. Family dynamics are tied to many broader issues that are \nconstantly evolving, and we are in completely uncharted territory. I do not know what \nhouseholds will look like years from now, but I do believe that the running joke about still living \nwith your parents at the age of twenty-five will no longer be seen as an insult. Instead, it will \nbecome normalized as a result of today\u2019s economic pressures and political decisions in America. \n \n \n \n\n \n8\n \n \n \nReferences \nBerger, V. E. (2024, October 22).

        "text": "Isabel Garcia \nSOC 250-001 \nDouglas Engleman \n19 September 2025 \nReflection #1 \nIntroduction \n\u200b\nIn the book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To Do,\u201d Michael Sandel explores different \ntheories of justice through real-world cases. He is good at showing how theories connect with \nreal moral questions. He focuses on theories such as utilitarianism, libertarianism, Kantian ethics, \nRawls\u2019 theory of fairness, Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics, and debates on equality. I will be focusing on \ncertain arguments from some of the chapters and reflecting on how they connect to my lived \nexperiences, then critiquing their strengths and weaknesses to pose questions. \nDoing The Right Thing \n\u200b\nIn chapter one, Sandel talks about the famous trolley problem, which is: You are stuck on \na trolley and the brakes have broken. You now see five workers on the track in front of you, but \nyou can't stop the trolley. You suddenly notice another track to the side with one worker. You \nknow you can turn the trolley onto the side track to save the five people and kill one person, or \nyou can stay on the main track and kill five people but save one. What would you do in this \nsituation, and is it justifiable to sacrifice one person to save five?  \nOne simple example of this is when I'm driving and two of my friends in the car want \nsomething to eat, but they each want to eat somewhere different, and I don't have time to go to \nboth places. So instead of not going anywhere, we all find somewhere that has something we \neach want, even if it's not our favorite. The strengths of this compromise are fairness, efficiency, \n\nreducing conflict, and considering everyone's opinion. The weaknesses of this compromise are \nthat it's a short-term solution, partial satisfaction, and partial inequality.  \nUtilitarianism \nIn the second chapter of the book, Jeremy Bentham and Jon Stewart Mill argue that \njustice means maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. One main example in the \nbook was throwing Christians to lions. In ancient Rome, they threw Christians to lions for the \namusement of other people in a coliseum. In the utilitarian view, the Christian suffers, but the \ncollective cheering of the people in the coliseum makes it \u201cmorally okay.\u201d  Does happiness really \njustify injustice? Is there anything that happiness cannot override?   \nA scenario I want to mention was back in high school, when I would see a group of \npeople making fun of another person. The person getting made fun of suffered, but everyone else \nwas laughing. Some strengths from this scenario are that it is relatable and realistic, and it has a \npersonal connection. The weaknesses from this are that it depends on someone\u2019s point of view, \nand it is not as morally shocking as the lions example. \nLibertarianism \n\u200b\nIn chapter three, Sandel uses the example of Michael Jordan\u2019s money. He focuses on \nJordan\u2019s large earnings from the NBA to touch on the libertarian views of justice. During the \nNBA season, if someone wants to watch Jordan play, they have to deposit five dollars. These \nproceeds go to him, and by the end of the season, he has made around 31 million dollars. As a \nresult, Jordan has more money than others. Robert Nozick believes that there are two problems \nwith theories like this of distributive justice: \u201cliberty upsets pattern\u201d and \u201cintervening in this way \n\u2013 taxing Jordan to support programs that help the disadvantaged \u2013 violates Jordan\u2019s rights by \ntaking his earnings.\u201d He believes that taking taxes from Jordan to help the poor violates Jordan\u2019s \n\nrights of self-ownership. However, Sandel argues that Nozicks\u2019 perspective has weaknesses. One \nexample is that Michael Jordan\u2019s success depended on social conditions and were not things that \nhe earned by himself.  \nThis example reminds me of school sports in high school. I saw athletes getting special \ntreatment because their abilities and skills brought money or attention to that school. Meanwhile, \nother students who worked just as hard in their academics didn\u2019t receive the same praise or \ntreatment. This raises larger questions: How much of school athletes\u2019 success comes from effort \nrather than the school already valuing sports more than academics? Also, if athletes\u2019 talents bring \nmoney to a school, does that mean they actually deserve more privileges than other people? \nWhat Matters Is The Motive/ Immanuel Kant \n\u200b\nIn chapter 5, Michael Sandel discusses a problem called \u201cIs It Wrong To Lie To A \nMurderer?\u201d Immanuel Kant believes lying is wrong no matter the circumstance because it is \nconsidered immoral behavior. This specific scenario asks what would you do if a friend was \nhiding in your house and a murderer with an axe came to the door asking where they were? \nWould you lie to save your friend or would you tell the truth and let your friend get murdered? \nThe strength in Kant\u2019s position is its consistency because it steers clear of making exceptions that \ncould justify lying whenever it is convenient. However, the weakness is that refusing to lie in this \nsituation could most likely result in someone dying.  \n\u200b\nA less harsh example that can tie into this is when my friends ask me for honest feedback \nabout an outfit. Usually I tell the truth because my friends and I are very transparent with each \nother, but with people I am not as close with, I sometimes avoid telling the truth because I do not \nwant to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. In moments like these, I choose compassion over Kant\u2019s rule to \n\u201cnever lie.\u201d This makes me think; can compassion sometimes be more respectful than honesty? \n\nBy following Kant\u2019s principle, would I be damaging or ruining some relationships by making \nmyself seem harsh or inconsiderate? \nThe Case For Equality/ John Rawls \n\u200b\nMichael Sandel focuses on John Rawls' \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d in this chapter. It is a \nmetaphorical term about choosing something without knowing anything in particular about who \nwe are as people. Sandel says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know our class or gender, our race or ethnicity, our \npolitical opinions or religious convictions. Nor do we know our advantages and disadvantages.\u201d \nHe wants to know which principles we would choose if this happened to us, and he knows we \nwon\u2019t choose utilitarian or libertarian. Rawls believed in two principles: one is equal basic \nliberties for everyone, and the other concerns social and economic inequalities. Philosophers \ndon\u2019t know if anyone would actually choose what Rawls said they would. Michael Sandel poses \nan important question: \u201cIs Rawls\u2019 thought experiment the right way to think about justice?\u201d \n\u200b\nWhen I was applying for financial aid before my freshman year at UNC Wilmington, I \nsaw how scholarships and financial aid make it possible for students to get into colleges that they \ncouldn\u2019t afford before. This helps and protects the least advantaged while also rewarding the \nmost privileged, just like Rawls\u2019s principle. It made me realize that education systems should not \njust focus on grades and performance, but also on equal opportunities. Would society look \ndifferent if everyone made decisions behind a veil of ignorance? \nArguing Affirmative Action \n\u200b\nIn this chapter, Sandel mentions the argument that affirmative action can be justified if it \npromotes diversity, which benefits everyone. Universities usually say, \u201ca racially mixed student \nbody is desirable because it enables students to learn more from one another than they would if \nall of them came from similar backgrounds\u201d and \u201cthe diversity argument maintains that \n\nequipping disadvantaged minorities to assume positions of leadership in key public advances the \nuniversity\u2019s civic purpose and contributes to the common good\u201d (page 171). This argument is \nstrong because diversity helps prepare students for real-world environments, increases empathy, \nand tries to get rid of assumptions. This argument still has a weakness, which is that diversity can \nfeel like a \u201cmeans to an end,\u201d which means that students can feel like they aren\u2019t represented \nenough, but still may have to try to speak for their peers. A lot of the time, I like to hear about \nother people\u2019s cultures and backgrounds because hearing stories from people who have had a \ndifferent life experience than me made me reconsider my own assumptions that I may have had a \nlong time ago. With that being said, would my own education be less valuable without learning \nabout other people\u2019s backgrounds and perspectives? \nConclusion \nIn \u201cJustice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To Do?,\u201d Sandel shows us that questions about \nfairness, equality, and morality are not just theories but real issues that everyone deals with every \nday. Whether it is deciding if happiness can excuse harm, wondering if honesty can go too far, or \nasking if success is really earned, these connect to everyday choices. Each theory had strengths \nand weaknesses, and many arguments and objections. My own experience with school, friends, \nand my education helped me realize that justice isn\u2019t just about following strict rules, but instead \nit\u2019s about finding a balance between all of them. Everyone needs to have respect, compassion, \nand empathy for one another, but also have time to focus on what is right for them and what will \nmake them happy. Sandel\u2019s book reminded me that justice is not only something that \nphilosophers debate, but something that everyone shapes through the decisions we make and the \nvalues we follow.",

        "text": "Karly Satterwhite  \nDr. Engelman  \nSOC 433 \n16 October  2025 \n \nMid Term Reflection  \n \nMental illness is something that most people really don't understand until it personally affects them or \nsomeone they love. It's so frequently unseen, unheard, and misunderstood especially when it's a severe mental \nillness like schizophrenia or major depression. After I read A Boy Broken by Douglas J. Engelman, my \ninstructor in sociology, I was really touched by what was done to him and his personal pain he wrote of in \nregard to his son, Doug Jr. His honesty about how his family dealt with Doug's schizophrenia gave me a \ndifferent perspective on the emotional toll of mental illness not only on the diagnosed patient, but also on his or \nher loved ones. Engelman's journey through the loss, denial, confusion, and helplessness was not only a father's \nstory, it was a reflection on what so many families quietly go through every day. \nAt the beginning of A Boy Broken in the Prologue we automatically hear about the sad passing of \nEngelman's son, Doug Jr. which starts the story off with you wondering what may have happened and why the \nbook started at such a big moment in his life. We soon find out that Doug has schizophrenia, when one hears \nthis you immediately think someone is crazy. Within A Boy Broken Engelman states \u201cthe word schizophrenia \nconjures up mental images of scenes from the movie \u201cPhysco\u201d with Anthony Perkins a mild-mannered motel \nclerk, at the same time acting on psychotic impulses to kill\u201d (Pg. 23) the stigma schizophrenia has is crazy due \nto how it is presented on social media or the movies. Once you are diagnosed with something like schizophrenia \nit can tear you down more because of how people will view you and treat you. Many people will not be willing \nto help or even look at you if they know you have a mental disorder. Once hearing this news and having to tell \nyour loved ones is also a hard thing to do and that showed in this book. Reading about how Engelman went \n\nthrough many stages of denial once finding this out about his son was really eye opening. At first not wanting to \nbelieve it and then it turning into anger because what could happen to someone you love dearly.  \nWhen becoming someone's caregiver it can weigh you down very heavily. Engelman did not know what it \ntruly meant to be a care giver or what to do when it came to helping Doug with his schizophrenia. Engelman \nfound a book called Surviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual which helped him understand different kinds of \ntreatments for it and some helpful facts on schizophrenia to know what was true and what wasn't because of all \nthe stigma it has.  You never know how much someone will need your help until it is too late and you are too far \nin the process. Many people will think they are just looking out for their loved ones then come to the realization \nthat the amount of help that they are giving is more on the care giver side and may end up just becoming a \ncaregiver. This can take a toll on someone's mental and physical health due to possibly being held back from \nliving a regular day to day life instead of being able to live freely and worryless, you must make sure the person \nis always okay and safe. \nWhen someone is diagnosed with a mental disorder, especially one as severe and life-altering as \nschizophrenia, it's not uncommon for them to react with denial or disbelief. This reaction is often not just \nemotional resistance but a psychological defense mechanism. Accepting such a diagnosis means confronting the \nfact that your perception of reality may not be accurate, that your own mind, something you\u2019ve always trusted, \ncould be misleading you. This is an extremely upsetting finding, and individuals naturally avoid it. With \nschizophrenia, denial is more complex. The symptoms themselves which are  hallucinations, delusions, \ndisorganized thinking could be so severe and real sounding that the person literally cannot distinguish them \nfrom reality. To them, these events are real. For example, in Engelman's story, his son still remembers that there \nhas to be a Wendy, even though there is mounting evidence that she is an illusion. To the rest of the world, it \nmight be irrational or stubborn, but to his son, Wendy exists. Being told that she doesn't exist isn't confusing; it's \ndangerous to his entire idea of reality. This denial of the diagnosis is also described in medical circles as \n\"anosognosia,\" an illness where the patient knows no better about their illness. It's not denial on the emotional \nplane, but instead a neurological expression of the disease itself. This makes schizophrenia very difficult to \ntreat, as the patient will refuse medication or therapy, not out of being obstinate, but because they simply feel \n\nthat nothing is the matter with them. For loved ones and family members, having a person struggle this way can \nbe emotionally debilitating. There's a particular kind of helplessness that comes from understanding that no \nmatter how hard you work trying to explain or assist them, they may not comprehend it or worse, they might \neven assume you're part of the issue. The emotional burden becomes overwhelming. You're constantly second \nguessing your own approach: Am I doing any good? Am I doing it worse? Is there something I can do that will \nreach them? May people ask that question hoping to receive and answer but it never comes.  \nI spent my childhood watching one of my siblings struggle with depression. It wasn't something that came \nand went, it lingered, quietly affecting everything in our home. And yet, all these years on, he still struggles and \nhas become a constant presence in all of my family's lives. My brother sleeps all day. He barely speaks to \nanyone, and when he does, he becomes quickly annoyed. He has no interest in hanging out with us, and it's clear \neven though he doesn't say anything  that he doesn't care about himself much. There's a heaviness around him \nthat can't be ignored, though he attempts to hide it. It's not tiredness or crankiness, you can just see in his eyes \nthat he is struggling. I wake up the majority of mornings with him in my head wondering whether he slept \nthrough the night, or if he is okay. I question if there is something I could be doing to help him feel more \nsupported. I overhear my parents hushing each other when they think no one is listening. They are always \nworried about him whether he is doing all right, about his life after college, about his sanity. I realize that they \nare scared too. Scared of what will happen if he doesn't change or if he will be okay. No matter how much they \ntry to hide the depth of their fear from us,I can see it and I can hear it. Their fear equals my own, and sometimes \nthe entire house seems to be holding its collective breath for a break to come in the form of a turning point that \nnever happens. The worst thing is, my brother has no idea just how much this affects us. He simply can't \nunderstand how much we're thinking of him, speaking of him when he's left the room, putting in emotional \neffort to hope that he'll be fine. Depression does something to individuals, makes them oblivious to the love \nsurrounding them. It is like living inside their own mind, and nothing can get through. They always feel \ninvisible, unwanted, or alone even when they are surrounded by people who would do anything just to make \nthem smile again. That's the greatest agony. We are here, we care, we're trying  but he can't sense it, or maybe he \ndoes not think it exists. My brother is struggling. It touches routines, relationships, moods, and even \n\ncommunication. It creates distance and guilt, silence and tension. You start feeling helpless, stuck between \nwanting to help and not knowing how because it can cause so many problems., I have learned that depression \ncan be incredibly isolating not only for the person but also for the ones who love them. \nA Boy Broken has not only deepened my understanding of schizophrenia and its devastating impact on \nindividuals and families, but also made me reflect on my own experiences with mental illness in my family. \nDouglas J. Engelman's honest and painful journey through his son\u2019s illness showed me how isolating, \noverwhelming, and emotionally exhausting it can be to care for someone who is struggling. Mental disorders \nlike schizophrenia and depression don\u2019t just affect the person diagnosed, they ripple through entire families, \ncreating worry, confusion, and heartache. Through both Engelman\u2019s story and my own experiences, I\u2019ve come \nto understand the importance of compassion, patience, and education when supporting those battling mental \nillness. We must also recognize and support the caregivers, who often carry a heavy burden in silence. Most \nimportantly, we must continue to fight the stigma surrounding mental health so that more people can feel safe \nseeking the help they need, and fewer families are left to suffer in silence.",

        "text": "1 Cummings  \nCescily Cummings  \nSOC 433 \nDr. Engelman  \n10/16/25 \nMidterm Reflection  \n \nBefore I begin this reflection I want to point out that the author of A Boy Broken, Dr Douglas J. \nEngelman is my Professor. To maintain a level of respect throughout this paper I will refer to him \nas Dr. Engelman or Doug\u2019s father.  \n \n\u200b\nReading A Boy Broken by Douglas J. Engelman was one of the most emotional and \npowerful experiences I\u2019ve ever had with a book. I was glued to this story, not just because of the \nstory of mental illness or loss but about a fathers deep love and heartbreak. From the very first \npage I could feel the emotions within the book as if I was living his life. The honesty and \nvulnerability in the writing was unlike anything I had read before.  \nWhat was so powerful was how vividly every moment was being described. His words were so \nreal I could see everything in my head like I was there. I could feel the worry, frustration, and \nexhaustion, even the excitement and most importantly the love he had for his son.  \nThe scene that stayed with me the most was the drive to McDonalds. Doug\u2019s father noticed he \nhad been quite distant, easily agitated, and often distracted. Especially after the incident of his \nsister Melissa having to call the cops because Doug was on the back porch yelling things such as \n\u201cwhy do they have to die\u201d, they became very worried. Little did they know that the officer that \nshowed up that day (officer Thomas) would soon help lead to the diagnosis as to what was going \n\n2 Cummings  \non. What seemed like a normal car ride to go get some breakfast turned into the day that changed \ntheir lives forever. Dr. Engelman wanted to get to the bottom of what was going on. He had \nasked Doug what was going on and could tell that he had something to say but didn\u2019t know how. \nDoug began by telling his father that two people were always with him (Dave and Wendy). \nWhen I read that part I could feel the shock and worriness flood through my body. He then \nshifted toward the back seat to say that one of the individuals he saw, \u201cWendy\u201d was sitting in the \ncar with them and was asking his father if he could see her. At that moment I suddenly felt \nheavier. The amount of detail that was brought to this scene made me feel like I was in that car. \nAs worried as Dr. Engelman must\u2019ve felt, the amount of compassion and understanding he had in \nthat moment is truly inspiring. He responded back by saying \u201cI can\u2019t see her, but I believe you\u201d. \nInstead of pushing off and diminishing Doug\u2019s visions he decided to be there for him and not \nmake him sound crazy. This is one of the many examples that show who Dr. Engelman was as a \nfather during this journey in Doug\u2019s life. He might not have had all the answers or any \ninformation about what was happening nor could he fix what was going on but he could be there \nfor his son and that is what mattered the most. I am not a parent nor have I dealt with serious \nmental illness in my life but it was such a raw moment that showed both the love and pain of \nbeing a parent to someone struggling with a mental disorder.  \nAnother moment that stood out to me in his book was when Doug went missing from his \ntreatment home, Madden. The fear that washed over Dr. Engelman after ending the phone call \nfrom Mary Ann telling him his son was gone and they haven\u2019t seen him in over a day. Just a few \nweeks prior Doug had suddenly come home for the evening and showed up on the family\u2019s \ndoorstep. He was begging to come back home saying he didn\u2019t feel safe there and Dr. Engelman \nhad to make the tough decision to do what seemed best for his son which was to keep him in \n\n3 Cummings  \ntreatment. After receiving the news, Doug\u2019s father and stepmother Wendy, called place after \nplace trying to get any hint as to where Doug was. Weeks had gone by and there was still no \nanswer. Until one Friday afternoon on week three of his disappearance, Doug had called. The \nsigh of relief I had as if I had been looking for him for weeks myself. The whole rest of the \nchapter felt like I was watching a scene from a movie. I  could picture bringing Doug back home \nand getting dinner ready and the family sitting around the table to eat the lasagna. I felt every \nemotion Dr. Engelman had felt. I was so connected to this book all because of Dr. Engelman\u2019s \nwords.  \nOne of the many lines that stood out to me from the book was when Dr. Engelman wrote \u201cOn \none hand I was so happy Doug trusted me enough to share his experiences with me. It was great \nthat I had that kind of relationship with him! On the other hand it was very clear to me that he \nwas a long way from truly understanding what was happening to him\u201d. That quote not only \ncaptured the joy he felt but also the sadness of reality. It really showed what it was like to have a \nloved one who was struggling with something you can\u2019t fix.  \nThroughout the book there was many instances where Dr. Engelman was tested on how to \nacknowledge his personal feelings but also try to understand his sons. There was a fine line that \nhe did not want to push him too hard but he also had to set boundaries. It is not easy to do and it \nis truly heartbreaking but that is what he felt was best. For example when Doug had called his \nfather to tell him he was robbed and 5 dollars of his weekly allowance was gone. It was not about \nthe money, it was about the responsibility and accountability that was needed. He wanted to help \nwithout enabling this behavior. Real moments like this show what parents like Dr. Engelman \nfaces every day. Now this does not only apply to this specific situation, any parent can go \nthrough this with their child.  \n\n4 Cummings  \nWhat was so inspiring throughout Dr. Engelman\u2019s work was no matter how hard things got, he \nnever gave up on his son. Even through the unknown, heartbreak, loss, and fear, his love never \nfaded.  \nThis book could truly change lives especially to those who may be going through some of the \nsame circumstances. Whether it\u2019s a family member watching a loved one struggle with mental \nillness, someone navigating grief/loss, or anyone struggling with their own mental health, there \nare so many lessons to be taught within this book. This book portrays the message that you are \nnot alone and there is help out there!  \nI really appreciated that Dr. Engelman let us get to know a piece of Doug that did not involve his \npersonal struggles. He shared his love and how good he was at art, he shared the caring moments \nsuch as the presents under the Christmas tree for his siblings. It helped me see Doug for who he \nwas as a person and not just a diagnosis.  \nWhen Dr. Engelman shared the loss of both of his children, it was heartbreaking to read. The \npain and emptiness that was described felt so real. Even through the heartbreak Dr. Engelman \nhad a great amount of strength. He found purpose after loss. By sharing this story with the world \nhe turned his pain into something so powerful. I as well as Dr. Engelman was so moved by \nPastor Dick Johnson\u2019s words. He told him \u201cDon\u2019t be a victim, Doug died that night, not you\u201d. As \nhard as that may be to hear, he was right. Soon after that Dr. Engelman decided he would go to a \nsupport group for grieving parents. I had never thought of it this way but as I reflect I think he is \nso right when he says that the group was enabling parents to hold onto their grief to the point \nwhere it became unhealthy. It consumed them.  \nThis book truly changed my life and it can change many others. It shifted my whole outlook on \nmental health. Not that I thought about it negatively but I have a new found respect for those \n\n5 Cummings  \nwho are struggling. Reading this book made me realize what it means to love unconditionally. I \nhave a new sense of compassion whether that be from my own family, a friend, or even a \nstranger. Everyone is fighting their own battles and most of the time we can\u2019t see them. The most \nimportant thing we can do is have compassion and be understanding because you never know \nwhat someone is going through. Kindness can go a long way especially when someone is \nsuffering in silence. This book is one that I will keep close to my heart for a long time.",

        "text": "Barker 1 \nJalen Barker  \nDr. Engelman  \nSOC-345  \n24 October 2025 \n \nMerica in 2035 \n \nBy 2035, the American family will look very different from the early twenty-first century. \nMarriage rates have been declining, fertility rates are lower, more mothers are working \noutside the home, blended families and single-parent households are increasingly common, \nand LGBTQ+ families are more visible and accepted. These trends suggest that the \ntraditional nuclear family will no longer dominate. Families will vary widely in structure, \nsize, and household roles, reflecting social, economic, and technological changes that shape \ndaily life. Families will also face societal pressures like economic uncertainty, changing \nworkplace expectations, and global instability, which will influence decisions about living \narrangements, career paths, and raising children. \n \nMarriage has historically been the central foundation of family life in the United States. \nHowever, fewer adults are marrying, and many delay marriage until later in life. Cohabitation \nwithout marriage is more common, and some adults choose to remain single. By 2035, \nmarriage may be seen as an option rather than a requirement, with many families beginning \nas cohabiting couples or single-parent households. Blended families, where partners bring \nchildren from previous relationships, will also increase in number, reflecting multiple \ntransitions in adult partnerships. Studies of demographic trends show that family households \nare becoming more diverse and less dependent on traditional marriage (Phys.org, 2024). In \naddition, children growing up in nontraditional households may experience a wider range of \nsocial and emotional support networks, as communities become more inclusive. \n \nFertility trends are also changing. Women are having fewer children, delaying childbearing, \nor choosing not to have children at all. The average family will likely have one or two \nchildren rather than three or more. This trend will result in smaller households, with children \nbeing born when parents are older. Smaller families may increase the responsibility on \nyounger adults to support older relatives as populations age. Demographers predict that the \nstructure of families will continue to shrink in size and vary widely, with fewer siblings and \nsmaller extended families (Phys.org, 2024). Families may need to rely more on community \nprograms and childcare services to help children develop social skills and receive care when \nparents are busy with work or other responsibilities. \n \nMothers in the workforce will continue to shape family life. Most mothers with young \nchildren will work part-time or full-time, normalizing dual-income households. Fathers are \nalso expected to take on more caregiving responsibilities, though the balance will vary by \nhousehold. Flexible work arrangements, remote jobs, and gig economy work will influence \ndaily schedules. Families will coordinate childcare, household duties, and professional \nresponsibilities more than ever before. Workforce studies indicate that women\u2019s participation \n\nBarker 2 \nin employment continues to rise, and dual-earner households are increasingly the norm \n(Visual Capitalist, 2025). Economic and social pressures may challenge traditional gender \nexpectations, particularly for men whose identity has been linked to the breadwinner role. \n \nAutomation and artificial intelligence will affect the workforce and family life, particularly \nfor men in sectors such as manufacturing and logistics. Many men may face \nunderemployment or job displacement, which could contribute to financial instability and \nalter family roles. Mothers may become primary earners in some households, and \nsingle-parent or blended households could increase. These shifts may influence decisions \nabout marriage and childbearing, as financial stability remains important in forming \nlong-term partnerships. AI and automation will continue to reshape employment \nopportunities, household income, and family routines (Imagining the Digital Future Center, \n2025). This could also create a temporary situation where women hold more jobs than men, \nas households adjust to these changes. Families will need to find new ways to share \nresponsibilities and support each other during these economic and social transitions. \n \nSingle-parent families, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families will become more common \nand socially accepted. Legal recognition and growing cultural acceptance will make same-sex \nhouseholds with children less exceptional. Blended families will continue to reflect the \nrealities of divorce and remarriage, requiring flexibility in household routines. By 2035, a \ntypical family could involve a male and female partner with two children, a same-sex couple \nraising an adopted child, or a single mother supported by a community childcare network. \nThe diversity of household arrangements will become normalized, reducing stigma and \nencouraging inclusive social policies (Phys.org, 2024). I have personal experience with this \ndiversity, as I was raised by two gay fathers. This perspective shows how children can thrive \nin many different household arrangements and how communities can adapt to support these \nfamilies. \n \nTechnology will continue to play a major role in family life. Many parents will work from \nhome, as it is more convenient for scheduling, and children will do more online schoolwork. \nHowever, the widespread use of AI will influence younger generations\u2019 critical thinking and \nproblem-solving skills, making it important for parents and schools to guide learning in ways \nthat balance technology with independent thought. Smart homes, digital learning tools, and \nAI assistance in daily routines will make life more convenient, but families will need to \nmaintain connections and emotional support (Imagining the Digital Future Center, 2025). \nChildren may need additional guidance to ensure they develop social skills, creativity, and \nproblem-solving abilities that technology alone cannot provide. \n \nDemographic change will influence family life as well. Smaller family sizes and an aging \npopulation mean children may grow up with fewer siblings and relatives. Grandparents and \nolder adults may require more care, and multi-generational households could become more \ncommon. Kinship networks will be smaller but older on average, making social and \ncommunity support increasingly important for both children and elderly family members. \nImmigration and cultural diversity will further expand the range of family structures, leading \n\nBarker 3 \nto more interracial and intercultural households. Families will vary in language, traditions, \nand parenting styles, reflecting the demographic makeup of the nation (Phys.org, 2024). \nThese trends suggest that children will grow up with more exposure to different cultures and \nexperiences, which could broaden understanding and acceptance in society over time. \n \nSocietal pressures and uncertainty may also affect family life. Economic volatility, \ntechnological disruption, and global instability can create stress that influences family \nformation and household roles. The Atlantic Council notes that society faces uncertainty from \nboth global conflicts and domestic pressures, which may affect how adults approach \nmarriage, childbearing, and household stability (Atlantic Council, 2025). Families may adapt \nby relying on more flexible living arrangements, community networks, and shared resources, \nwhich will allow households to survive and thrive despite changing conditions. \n \nCommunity structures, schools, and childcare will continue to adapt to new family models. \nSchools will need to accommodate children from blended, single-parent, and same-sex \nhouseholds while providing equitable learning opportunities. Childcare networks may \nexpand, including cooperative models where families share responsibilities. Local \ncommunities may provide additional social support, including eldercare assistance and shared \nresources for working parents. These adaptations will help maintain stability and cohesion in \nhouseholds that do not follow the traditional nuclear model (Phys.org, 2024). Families will \nalso learn to communicate more openly and coordinate schedules, ensuring children receive \nguidance and care even as household roles change. \n \nOverall, families in 2035 will be smaller, more diverse, and less defined by traditional roles. \nMarriage will remain one option among many. Most households will have dual incomes, with \nparents sharing childcare responsibilities. Single-parent, blended, and same-sex households \nwill be visible and widely accepted. Technology, economic pressures, and demographic shifts \nwill continue to influence household routines and family relationships. The central factor in \ndefining family will be care, connection, and mutual support rather than adherence to \ntraditional social norms. \n \nBy 2035, the American family will reflect adaptability, diversity, and choice. Policies, \nworkplaces, and social infrastructure will need to support flexible household arrangements, \nchildcare, eldercare, and dual-income work patterns. Families will continue to evolve, \nshowing that while the shape of family may change, the need for connection, support, and \ncare remains constant.

It is written from the\u200b\n\u200bperspective of the father, Doug, of the primary character, also Doug, but I will refer to the father\u200b\n\u200bas Douglas to prevent confusion. This is the story of Doug\u2019s schizophrenia and his progression.\u200b\n\u200bDouglas recollects old memories of young Doug, and how he is a sweet and innocent\u200b\n\u200byoung boy. Douglas does move out and eventually away after his divorce with Doug\u2019s and his\u200b\n\u200bother child Melissa\u2019s mother, mentioning he constantly thinks about and regrets the decision he\u200b\n\u200bmade due to it creating a distance between Douglas and his children in the midst of their peak\u200b\n\u200bdevelopmental ages. He recalls when the divorce first happened and he moved out, how it pained\u200b\n\u200bDoug to see his dad leave the driveway at five years old, and then again at ten years old how the\u200b\n\u200bpain came back when he moved out of state.\u200b\n\u200bIn April 1991, Doug came to visit Douglas after dropping out of his second semester of\u200b\n\u200bcollege which worried Douglas and Wendy, his wife. When Douglas picked Doug up, he was\u200b\n\u200bdirty and smelled horribly. The older Doug got, the more he began to seem like an entirely\u200b\n\u200bdifferent person. Doug explained to Douglas that he was hearing and seeing things; he had two\u200b\n\u200bpeople he saw regularly: Dave and Wendy. This got brought up because he saw Dave and Wendy\u200b\n\u200bin the backseat of Douglas\u2019 car when he first got picked up, but there was no one there. Douglas\u200b\n\u200bexperiencing this breakdown for the first time was very scared and had so many questions\u200b\n\u200brushing through his head. I too would be very fearful with the situation because it is a scary\u200b\n\n\u200bposition to be in, especially because it is the child you raised and this is a behavior that has never\u200b\n\u200bpreviously happened. The two of them go to eat dinner with Melissa and their brother Jake,\u200b\n\u200bDouglas encouraging Doug to clean up before they go but Doug persisting that he eat. He also\u200b\n\u200bwould hardly speak to anyone, including in the nearly hour long car ride with his father. Douglas\u200b\n\u200brecalls this as the first time he ever felt uncomfortable with Doug and the situation, which he\u200b\n\u200bmentions multiple times throughout that he regrets feeling the way he did. While at dinner,\u200b\n\u200bDouglas suggests that Doug stay with Melissa for a few days, considering Wendy is pregnant and\u200b\n\u200bshe was worried about Doug being around her. During this trip it was noticeable that Doug\u2019s\u200b\n\u200bsymptoms rose drastically in which he needed to go live in an inpatient facility. During his stay\u200b\n\u200bwith Melissa, he experiences an episode in which she does not know what to do and calls the\u200b\n\u200bpolice in fear. She calls Douglas the following morning, recalling everything that had happened\u200b\n\u200bthe previous night. She claimed that Doug was outside yelling at open space, questioning why\u200b\n\u200b\u201cthey\u201d have to die, Melissa being unsure who \u201cthey\u201d is referring to. The police officer who\u200b\n\u200bresponded to her call provided her with a resource of a potential facility he could be taken to\u200b\n\u200bwhich she relayed over to Douglas. After a few discussions with the police officer and a lot of\u200b\n\u200bcontemplation, it was agreed upon that Doug had to go live in an inpatient facility at Loyola\u200b\n\u200bMedical Center\u2019s Mental Health unit. He was, however, struggling a little bit in this facility.\u200b\n\u200bSome of the other guys were making fun of him, referring to him as gay, and some others were\u200b\n\u200bstealing his money.\u200b\n\u200bOutside of this mental health unit, he did not have a place to call home. Douglas recalls\u200b\n\u200bhow he did not speak about Doug, regretting that he did not build a support system sooner and\u200b\n\u200bregrets hiding. His mother, Bonnie, was also not mentally well herself so that combination is\u200b\n\u200bdoomed from the start. Douglas receives a call one day that Doug has run away from the facility\u200b\n\n\u200band has not returned, leaving Douglas terrified. He frantically begins to search for every\u200b\n\u200bhomeless shelter and food bank in the area and calls them, begging them to keep an eye out for\u200b\n\u200bDoug. After weeks of calling and not receiving any true answers, he insists on going out and\u200b\n\u200bsearching for him himself. He creates a map of everywhere he could possibly be and while he\u200b\n\u200bdoes not find his son, it makes him feel better about the situation because he took initiative to\u200b\n\u200blook for him instead of doing nothing. After three weeks he receives a call from his son himself\u200b\n\u200bfrom a shelter he had previously contacted. Douglas comes and gets him to return him the\u200b\n\u200bfollowing morning to the facility. In the time they had together, Doug shares about his three week\u200b\n\u200badventure living on the streets. He shares that he ended up on a bad side of town called Madden,\u200b\n\u200bthe one place Wendy was hoping he was not. He mentions how he ended up with a group of guys\u200b\n\u200bwho protected him, which was a noticeably good change for him considering he was getting\u200b\n\u200bmade fun of in the facility. They ultimately decide he would not go back to that facility and\u200b\n\u200bmoved into an apartment with one of the guys in Madden and ended up going back to work,\u200b\n\u200bwhich unfortunately did not last long. He ended up joining another mental health institution\u200b\n\u200bcalled Chartiers Mental Health/Mental Rehabilitation Center and moved in with his mother\u200b\n\u200bshortly after, very quickly learning his mother did not have the ability to take care of him\u200b\n\u200bbecause she herself had her own issues. He then moved into an apartment with Melissa, which\u200b\n\u200balso did not work out. He proceeded to move to Brookline after progressing after his time at\u200b\n\u200bMercy Behavioral Health. Watching him develop and improve with the daily check-ins was very\u200b\n\u200bencouraging to read and see him progressively get better and live on his own. Unfortunately, I\u200b\n\u200bwas absolutely devastated that he passed the second he began to get better. The life he had begun\u200b\n\u200bwas seemingly going to be beautiful for him and he deserved it after everything that went on\u200b\n\u200bleading up to this point.\u200b\n\n\u200bOne of the pieces that stood out the most to me was the struggle of caregiving. I have\u200b\n\u200balways acknowledged the fact that it is a very difficult thing to do, especially with all of the\u200b\n\u200bstigma that comes with the association of mental illness. Douglas mentions that \u201cthe burden\u200b\n\u200boften falls to caring family members to research and organize all of the resources available in\u200b\n\u200border to navigate this new experience, as well as the resolve to access help for ourselves\u201d.\u200b\n\u200bWanting to have an answer seems to typically be the first response a parent has when their child\u200b\n\u200bbecomes diagnosed with a mental disorder. Caregivers also typically tend to blame themselves,\u200b\n\u200bDouglas says so himself: \u201cIn many ways, when Doug was diagnosed, I felt responsible.\u200b\n\u200bImmediately and profoundly, Doug\u2019s illness would be a reflection of my family, and of our\u200b\n\u200bparenting. This is what happens to a family, but why? Would I, for example, feel directly\u200b\n\u200bresponsible for Doug\u2019s diagnosis of cancer? Or a heart condition? Generally, the answer would\u200b\n\u200bbe no.\u201d This comparison of illnesses stood out to me because ultimately they are both\u200b\n\u200blife-altering illnesses that could eventually lead to death, it is simply measured differently. The\u200b\n\u200bmention of grief also stood out to me because observing the change of one person you once knew\u200b\n\u200binto a completely new, unrecognizable personality within the same body is absolutely terrifying\u200b\n\u200band also a bit complicated, by the fact that the child is still with the family, and an ongoing\u200b\n\u200brelationship needs to be established.\u201d Sometimes caregivers are left to leave the patients entirely\u200b\n\u200band some stay with them the rest of their lives. Both are very draining mentally for these\u200b\n\u200bcaregivers. While you want to stay and help them, it takes a toll on yourself when your everyday\u200b\n\u200blife is being occupied by someone else and what is going on in their life.\u200b\n\n\u200bI believe that the family\u2019s role is one of the most important roles in situations like these.\u200b\n\u200bFamily support should always be top priority whenever a diagnosis of any kind arises. With the\u200b\n\u200bamount of stigma that surrounds mental health specifically, it is important to have a support\u200b\n\u200bsystem, especially directly connected to you firsthand. In my own personal experience, I have a\u200b\n\u200bdiagnosis for bipolar disorder and do not have a strong support system from my family. I would\u200b\n\u200bnot define it as weak either, it is more so of a pick-and-choose. This has caused me to not love\u200b\n\u200bthe status I am in yet be in a comfortable position. I am able to get medication, though I was not\u200b\n\u200b\u201callowed\u201d to until I was an adult and my parents are encouraging me to be in therapy even\u200b\n\u200bthough we cannot afford frequent sessions, but they also do not alter any stressors that could be\u200b\n\u200btriggering stressors nor do they \u201cbelieve\u201d I genuinely have this disorder. With a stronger support\u200b\n\u200bsystem like Doug had, I find that those situations typically turn out for the better.\u200b\n\u200bI personally was very intrigued by this story, not only due to the fact that I enjoy\u200b\n\u200bexamining mental health cases, but also because I am partially living it just not to the extent that\u200b\n\u200bDouglas wrote about. My younger sister was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, which her\u200b\n\u200bpsychiatrist believes could be developing into schizophrenia. While she is only nineteen so the\u200b\n\u200bsymptoms are more difficult to tell, as well as the fact that these two disorders can sometimes\u200b\n\u200boverlap with one another, she shows similar traits to Doug in how she sees people who are not\u200b\n\u200bphysically present. She also sometimes becomes \u201ctaken over\u201d by these characters, some being\u200b\n\u200bevil and some being good. Overall, I enjoyed reading and learning about a new perspective of\u200b\n\u200bschizophrenia and it opened my eyes about the mental illness.\u200b",

        "text": "Tristen Rogers \nSociology of Mental Disorder \nDr. Engelman \n17 October 2025 \nA Boy Broken Reflection \nA Boy Broken is such a powerful story that raised many emotions in me throughout the \nreading, and can help so many people in many different ways. While reading the book, I cried, I \nfelt happy, I felt so much love from parent to child, and I also felt angry at times. I was angry that \nsome people were taking advantage of Doug\u2019s vulnerable state during his time at Madden. I was \nsad so many times throughout the book, such as when Doug showed up to his dad\u2019s house scared \nthat he was going to be harmed because people thought he was gay, when he lived on the streets \nfor a couple of weeks, when he got in a car accident, and also when reading about Melissa\u2019s \nstory. I was so heart-warmed by the love that you had for your family and how much support you \ngave to Doug over the years, as well as the note you wrote him many years after his death. I was \njoyous when he was doing so well for himself, progressing, getting jobs, hanging out with his \nfriends, and making a connection with Abby. This book was an emotional roller coaster, and \nthere are so many benefits that this book will have as more people read it. This book is a big step \nin reducing stigma around mental disorders, and it can be a guide to help family members of \npeople diagnosed with one to get through the process.  \nThe book talks about how the goal is to help people in similar situations, such as family \nmembers of people with mental disorders. I think that this book has the potential to not only help \nfamily members and loved ones of people with mental disorders, but can also help anybody who \nreads it, having any sort of connection to mental disorders or none at all, because it can give \n\nthem insight into the misconceptions that people have about mental disorders and how people \nwith them can act, as well as discussing the severe stigma that surrounds mental health and \naffects so many people with connections to mental disorders. Teaching people about how the \nstigma can affect family members of people with mental disorders, as well as the people with the \ndisorder themselves, is really important because it is a step in the right direction to get rid of the \nstigma.  \nThis book helped me to understand the mental disorder of schizophrenia better as a \nwhole, which is really important. I think this could be one of the most powerful outcomes of this \nbook in reducing the stigma around schizophrenia, specifically. Before reading this book, I knew \nwhat schizophrenia was and the symptoms of it from learning about it in class, but I still had my \nmisconceptions about it. Society\u2019s view of schizophrenia is with fear because people think that \nsomeone with schizophrenia may harm them. This comes down to society being afraid of the \nunknown, because people aren\u2019t informed about schizophrenia and how it affects people with it. \nI am guilty of these views and being afraid of perceived schizophrenic people. Reading this \nbook, though, showed me that I have misconceptions. Following Doug\u2019s journey was \neye-opening because Doug was not this scary character who was constantly talking to himself \nand being violent, instead, he was a neat young man who was trying to get by, made friends with \nsome people on the street, had many times when he was really trying to make good of himself \nand do better as well as get better, and loved his family. I now know how skewed our views are \nabout people with schizophrenia, and I will never again have preconceived notions about people \nwith schizophrenia, or any mental disorder for that matter. I think, and hope, that many of the \npeople who read this book will also become enlightened on the subject and will look at \n\nschizophrenia in a new way, which is such a big step to breaking down the stigma surrounding \nschizophrenia and mental disorders as a whole.  \n\u200b\nYou talk about how the goal of this book is to help anyone, and you put emphasis on \nhelping people in a similar situation to you to get through these uncertain times. I am hopeful \nthat this book will achieve its goal because I think readers in similar situations to what you went \nthrough will find the book so helpful in getting them through their journey and staying \nsupportive of their child or loved one with a mental disorder, and knowing that it is a roller \ncoaster and not to give up on the disordered person. I think it will be similar to, but also go \nbeyond, how the book Surviving Schizophrenia helped you out a lot while you were having to \nnavigate those times. Having you discuss the way that Doug progressed and then had setbacks \nshows that it is not just constant progress, and it will hopefully prepare other parents of children \nwith schizophrenia and maybe other mental disorders as well for their journey, not to expect \nconstant progress, to be ready for the setbacks, and to be supportive the whole way through.  \n\u200b\nOne part of the book that I found really interesting and important was when you were \ndiscussing the grief process when it comes to finding out your child has a mental disorder, rather \nthan the types of grief that people see as \u201cnormal,\u201d such as the death of a child. You describe this \nreally well in the book, detailing it as losing a child in a different way, not to death but to a \nmental illness because \u201cthe disease alters the child they once knew\u201d(Engelman, 2023). There are \nso many reasons why the grief process for this situation is much different from the process when \nit comes to a death. The stigma surrounding mental illness causes the loved ones of people with \nmental illness to usually keep the knowledge of the illness to themselves, which, in turn, is \nharmful to the grief process because it doesn\u2019t allow everyone else to give support to the grieving \npeople. Mental disorders are not linear processes, and they have many ups and downs, with \n\nprogress and setbacks throughout the journey. The family has to adjust to the reality that they are \nfacing, where their child may not be set for the future they once thought, and the constant \nchanges and challenges that the child faces over time make the grieving process much \nlonger-term. I think that it is really important and helpful that you discuss this in the book and \neven state that, \u201coften, our experience of loss and grief is not recognized or validated by society. \nThe loss of a child to a diagnosis of mental illness, and the life-course trajectory it frequently \npredicts, is not understood by society in the same way as the death of a child\u201d(Engelman, 2023). \nParents who are going through this and read this book can be warned, in a way, that this is a \nphenomenon that happens, and they can be more expecting for it. I also think that this part of the \nbook can really help a parent who is experiencing this because they can learn that keeping the \nmental illness a secret can impede on their grieving process, so they may be more inclined to tell \npeople around them, which can be helpful to their grief because they are getting the support they \nneed from others in the time when it is needed. As people who aren\u2019t going through this \nexperience also read this book, it can be so helpful to change the way that society defines \ngrief-worthy situations, and it will hopefully make readers realize that people going through this \nare not getting the same reaction and support to their situation and grief as people who are \nexperiencing the death of a loved one. This book can bring insight to readers to deeply support \npeople who are experiencing the loss of a loved one to mental illness and hopefully create \nchange so that, over time, more and more support and recognition are given to people going \nthrough this unique loss.  \nThis book made me think about what I have heard regarding schizophrenia experiences in \ndifferent cultures, because seeing how Doug\u2019s voices were distressing and harmful is \nsignificantly different from those of these other cultures, and that can\u2019t simply be a coincidence. \n\nThat is why I brought in further research, along with the evidence from the book, to figure out \nhow the schizophrenia experiences are different across cultures and societies. Anthropologist \nTanya Luhrmann studied how schizophrenia affects people in Africa, India, and the United \nStates. She interviewed people from each culture and found very interesting results. All of the \nrespondents heard voices, but the voices in the West were vastly different compared to those of \nthe Eastern cultures. Many of the people from India described the voices as family members, \nspirits, or even playful and entertaining. The people interviewed from Africa described the \nvoices as good and having positive experiences with the voices. Very few people in these \ncultures describe schizophrenia and the voices as a brain disease or medical or psychiatric \nproblem. The researchers found that religion didn\u2019t play a factor in the voices; rather, \u201cthe \ndifference seems to be that the Chennai (India) and Accra (Ghana) participants were more \ncomfortable interpreting their voices as relationships and not as the sign of a violated \nmind\u201d(Parker, 2014). The way that schizophrenia is seen and treated in a culture can have a big \neffect on how patients with schizophrenia experience voices. This is demonstrated in this study \nby how voices are heard in African and Indian cultures compared to America, where the voices \nare violent and hateful. The research found that not one American described having positive \nexperiences with their voices (Parker, 2014). Americans didn\u2019t know who the voices were that \nspoke to them, and many of them had really gruesome experiences with the voices. Americans \nsee themselves as having a disease, and the voices are a symptom of that.  \nThis is really important to connect to the book because in Doug\u2019s first psychotic break, he \nwas talking about people dying, as well as when he was in the car with his dad, having a moment \nwhere he was bent over in severe pain. This is because the people he was hallucinating were \nhurting him as he was saying, \u201cthey can put their hands inside me,\u201d and, \u201cstop them Dad, please \n\nmake them stop\u201d(Engelman, 2023). This is similar to how the Americans in Luhrmann\u2019s research \ndescribed their voices, \u201c\u2018like torturing people, to take their eye out with a fork, or cut someone\u2019s \nhead and drink their blood, really nasty stuff.\u201d Other Americans (five of them) even spoke of \ntheir voices as a call to battle or war \u2013 \u201c\u2018the warfare of everyone just yelling\u2019\u201d\u2019(Parker, 2014). I \nthink that this all comes back to how schizophrenia is seen and treated in the United States, and \nhow, if we change the way it is viewed, we could change the experiences that patients of \nschizophrenia have with their hallucinations and voices. We could stop treating it like it is a brain \ndisease and a very negative thing in society, as well as changing how therapists talk with the \npatients because, \u201cone new approach claims it is possible to improve individuals\u2019 relationships \nwith their voices by teaching them to name their voices and to build relationships with them, and \nthat doing so diminishes their caustic qualities\u201d(Parker, 2014). Luhrmann discusses how violent \nand negative voices are not a certain symptom of schizophrenia; instead, this can be changed and \nhelped with the reshaping of societal views.  \nIn the end, it all comes back down to the stigma around schizophrenia and mental \ndisorders. Stigma has such a big influence on how people with mental disorders and their loved \nones go through their journeys. Stigma is so negative to how people are treated, how they are \nviewed, their grieving processes, and how or if they seek help. Shown in the study by Tanya \nLuhrmann, schizophrenia is experienced in a much lighter and nicer way in Africa and India than \nit is experienced in the United States because of the societal views on the disorder. Stigma plays \nsuch a big part in the experiences of people with mental disorders and their loved ones as well, \nand this book can help start to break down the stigma and create a better environment, as well as \na better societal view on schizophrenia, and make the experiences of people with mental \ndisorders better, because even a small positive change is a good one. \n\nReferences \nEngelman, Douglas J.

        "text": "Kassidy Rushing \nSOC-250-001 \n19 September 2025 \n \nReflection of Justice \nThe book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To Do\" by Michael Sandel explores a variety \nof political and ethical philosophers and their ideologies regarding justice. We read and discussed \ntopics such as Kantian ethics, Rawls's theory of justice, and Aristotle's teleological view. Each \ntopic can be viewed from the libertarian or utilitarian framework and can be applied to \nreal-world issues such as the ethics of military service and surrogacy, the fairness of college \nadmissions, and individual civic responsibility.  \nIn the book, we were given two opposing philosophies: utilitarianism and libertarianism. \nThe ideology of utilitarianism was founded by the moral philosopher and legal reformer Jeremy \nBentham. This framework suggests that the correct actions are the ones that lead to majority \nhappiness. The focus is on the consequences of outcomes. An example of this would be the \nlifeboat story that opened chapter two. Four sailors were lost at sea and began to run out of food. \nAfter several days of deliberation, the captain decided they would eat the cabin boy. They \nconsider him the most expendable. A key criticism of utilitarianism is that it could justify \nsacrificing the happiness of some for the benefit of the majority. In contrast, the libertarian model \nsuggests that justice means respecting everyone's rights and freedom. The focus is on individual \nliberties. This framework would consider the rights of the cabin boy as an equal to the captain \nand other sailors. The primary criticism for libertarianism is that it could overlook social \ninequalities and only favor personal autonomy. For example, a libertarian would oppose taxing \n\nthe rich, even if that meant helping the poor. They would view this as a violation of the rich \nperson's rights. I am not in favor of one approach over the other. I can see the positives and \nnegatives in each ideology. My decision would be based on the given circumstances.  \nIn chapter 4, we discussed the moral market. We covered topics such as paying people to \nfight in war and bear children. The question arose: Is it ethical to sell our bodies and risk death? \nAccording to philosopher Immanuel Kant, the answer is no. \u201cWhat we commonly think of as \nmarket freedom or consumer choice is not true freedom, Kant argues, because it simply involves \nsatisfying desires we haven\u2019t chosen in the first place\u201d (Sandel, p. 44). Kant is a notorious critic \nof utilitarianism, which prioritizes maximum happiness. Regarding paid military service and \nsurrogacy, Kant would argue that exploiting the human body violates a moral law that states we \nshould treat people as ends in themselves. This means we should not use people for our own \npersonal gain and respect human worth. I would argue that true consent plays a key role in these \nscenarios. Every individual should be properly informed, and their actions must be voluntary. \nDenying a capable adult's wishes to serve in the military or become a surrogate, regardless of \nwhy they chose to make this decision, can be seen as condescending. Furthermore, when \nindividuals make a decision with a complete understanding of the risks and responsibilities, then \nI would argue this is not exploitation of human life. Instead, it is an expression of personal \nagency that should be respected unless they are being forced or manipulated. Kant also \nemphasizes moral agency. He believes people should want to do things out of moral duty and not \npersonal gain, manipulation, or desperation. I can agree to this to some extent. We discussed in \nclass how many join the military due to low socioeconomic status or lack of resources. My father \njoined the military when he was only seventeen years old. He was raised in a single-mother \nhousehold and had a lower socioeconomic status. He knew his best shot of attending a four year \n\nuniversity and achieving his goals was to join the military. He also had several family members \nin the military so this option seemed fitting. This example shows how social pressures and \neconomic status can influence people\u2019s choices. I believe it is important to acknowledge these \nfactors and focus on securing true consent that is free from coercion. This could be achieved \nthrough equal access to education, legal protection, and mental health support for those \ncontemplating making life-changing decisions. Overall, my father is proud that he got to serve \nthe nation and had a long, fulfilling career working with the military for over twenty years. He \nwas grateful for the opportunity to provide a better life for me and my family. The utilitarian \nframework would promote both voluntary and conscription military service. It would find \nindividual sacrifice acceptable if that meant protecting the majority of the people in that nation. \nSurrogacy under this framework would be acceptable if all parties benefited. If the parents \nreceive their child and the surrogate mother is compensated for her service, then the transaction \nis seen as morally justified. The libertarian framework would promote only voluntary military \nservice. It would find conscription service as a violation of individual rights. Libertarians would \noppose government mandates of national defense, such as the draft. Surrogacy would be morally \njustified as long as the surrogate consents to doing the service. This agreement would likely \nconsist of a legal contract signed by both parties.  \nChapter 6 poses a thought-provoking question provided by political philosopher John \nRawls. \u201cIn A Theory of Justice (1971), he argues that the way to think about justice is to ask \nwhat principles we would agree to in an initial situation of equality\u201d (Sandel, p. 56). Rawls refers \nto this initial situation of equality as the original position. This is a scenario in which we would \ncreate rules for a society without knowledge of who we will be. For example, right now, I am a \nwhite female who was raised in a middle-class household and who has a disability. In Rawls\u2019s \n\nscenario, I could wake up tomorrow as a Latino male from a working-class household with no \ndisability. The possibilities are endless. By removing our identities such as race, gender, class, \nability, or personal beliefs, Rawls believes we would choose a fairer society for all, especially for \nthose in disadvantaged positions. He called this method the veil of ignorance. By making these \ndecisions blindly, we are forced to eliminate bias. I agree that this method could be effective. By \neliminating bias, we are able to think more about others and their positions in life because it \ncould easily become our new reality. We so frequently in life only think about how we could \nbenefit. I believe this method would be a refreshing and interesting change of pace. This idea can \nbe applied to the college admissions process. Using the veil of ignorance, we as a society would \nlikely design a system that is fair for everybody, not just privileged individuals. I believe \naffirmative action would be set in place to help people with social disadvantages. It would \nconsider not only race but also gender, disability, and socioeconomic status. In Chapter 7, Sandel \naddresses affirmative action and questions whether it is a fair practice or a threat to merit. I \nbelieve affirmative action is a way to promote diversity and social mobility for disadvantaged \ngroups. College is a place for academic and social growth. As students, we have a unique \nexperience to learn from others who might have different backgrounds and beliefs from our own. \nPersonally, coming from a small town, I love the opportunity to meet and interact with fellow \nstudents from different cultures and lived experiences than myself. Rawls\u2019s idea challenges us to \nimagine a better society for all. Unfortunately, I see it as just an idea. I don't find it realistic for \nour current structure of society that, frankly, lacks a lot of empathy and fairness. \nIn chapter 8, Sandel introduces us to Aristotle\u2019s theory of justice. \u201cHe believes that \ndebates about justice are, unavoidably, debates about honor, virtue, and the nature of the good \nlife\u201d (Sandel, p. 72). This is based on the idea of teleology, which is the belief that everything has \n\na purpose or end goal. Aristotle believed that justice is about giving people what they deserve. \nFor example, the best football team deserves the best equipment, training facility, and coaches. \nThis idea can be reflected through civic responsibility. According to Aristotle, the purpose of \npolitics is to help people within the community live good, virtuous lives. Therefore, by \nexercising our rights as citizens and engaging in politics by voting, staying informed, and being \nactive members in our community, we are contributing to the common good. I believe everybody \nshould vote in order to make a difference within their community and or country. We can \ncontribute to the change we want to see. Staying informed keeps us educated on matters that are \naffecting the world around us and allows us to engage in conversations with others. Being an \nactive member in our communities builds trust and fellowship with other community members. \nThis can be achieved by volunteering, engaging in local politics, or simply checking in on a \nneighbor. These actions might seem small, but they can make a major difference in our society. \nAristotle's theory of justice reminds us that living a good life is about shared responsibilities. By \naccepting our civic responsibility, we are not only exercising our rights but are contributing to a \ngreater purpose. \n\u200bIn conclusion, the book \"Justice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To Do\" taught me that justice is \nnot a one-size-fits-all concept. Justice can not be summed up in one theory but rather is \nsomething we practice daily through our actions and decisions. Each philosopher, whether it be \nKant, Rawls, or Aristotle, offers a unique insight in their theories of justice and helps prompt \nthought provoking questions. After applying these theories to real world issues and sharing my \npersonal opinions and lived experiences, I recognize that justice requires reflection and \nresponsibility. We as a society have the power to help create a fairer world.",

It discusses various philosophers and scholars, \nexploring their views and then applying them to both hypothetical and real-life situations where \nthat moral system is considered. In explaining these views, Sandel narrows down to what he \nbelieves to be the best system for society to follow. \n\u200b\nThe first form of justice Sandel mentions is the idea of utilitarianism. Basically, actions \nthat maximize happiness and minimize pain are the correct moral actions. At first, this may seem \nlike the most moral system, but reducing morality to a simple calculation also creates its faults. It \ntakes the human element out of it and doesn\u2019t take the individual into account at all. In any \nsystem with majority rules, by definition, the minority suffers. In the example of the stranded \nEnglish sailors (pg. 18), the faults in the system become clear. Three people decided that to \nsurvive, they would have to nonconsensually kill the fourth person on the lifeboat, simply \nbecause he was the weakest and had no family. In a utilitarian view, this is the correct moral \noption; three people surviving due to the murder of another is morally permissible. However, this \ndoes not take into account the view of the fourth person. They are simply a means to an end: a \nnumber, a calculation. Reducing people\u2019s lives to simple numbers in this way also reduces our \nhumanity. If we do not transcend this idea of calculation, how are we any different than a simple \nequation? Is humanity\u2019s purpose to live happily and procreate, or can it be something that goes \n\n \nbeyond these natural processes? Shouldn\u2019t our chosen purpose in life be determined for \nourselves, and not left up to a mathematical formula? \n\u200b\nThis idea leads me into the second view Sandel mentions: libertarianism. The basis of \nlibertarianism is the idea of individualism. No one owes another anything, aside from not \nharming others in the pursuit of one\u2019s own life. An important example of this view is the concept \nof the redistribution of wealth, or the question of what people owe to their society. The question \nis: if a wealthy person earned their money fairly, do they owe any money to the less fortunate? A \nlibertarian would argue that they do not, because they got their money by their own merit, so \nthere is no obligation to give to the poorer citizens. If they were forced to give it away, in their \nview, it would be the equivalent of slave labor. A way Sandel uses to explain this further is by \nputting it in a different perspective. If a wealthy person is forced to give, for example, 20% of \ntheir earnings to the poor, then the poor people would effectively \u201cown\u201d the wealthy person for \nthe work they did to earn that amount (pg. 33). A liberatarian would say this is absurd, as the rich \nperson should not be compelled to do 20% more work, just to give away their earnings to \nsomeone who didn\u2019t do that work. In their view, while it would be nice if the rich person were to \ngive away their money, it should not be legally required. This view can seem appealing, likely \nbecause it sounds like the system in which most have spent their lives. We have been taught that \nfairness means one only owes an equal amount to what was given, and nothing more. But this \nsystem of keeping only to oneself leads to (as Sandel argues later in the book) ignoring the issues \nothers are facing and letting those issues get worse. This is amplified further by their belief in the \nfree market, but a free, unchecked market only increases the social and financial divide, as noted \nby John Rawls, who gives the best argument against libertarianism in the book. \n\n \n\u200b\nJohn Rawls offers a heavy critique of libertarianism. While his ideals are still based on \nindividual rights, he prioritizes equity. He argues that a free market causes unfairness due to \nmany different aspects. Most are based on the circumstances of one\u2019s birth, or things like natural \ntalent, social class, race, gender, sexuality, etc., all of which are outside the control of that \nindividual. Another variable is the talents that are rewarded in a society; for example, a talk show \nhost making millions of dollars while a teacher makes a fraction of that. These things impact \nhow well people do in a society, but they are not voluntarily chosen, so how can people be \njudged by such factors? Rawls (and I) argue that this \u201cfree\u201d system is not free at all. Therefore, \nmany, if not all, of the characteristics rewarded in a capitalist system are based on luck, and not \non fairness. Rawls' solution is the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, meaning policies are made by a group that \ndoes not know where they are in society. They do not know their race, gender, family history, \nsexuality, natural talents, etc. This ensures that they will, at the very least, make sure the people \nwho are at the bottom of the societal hierarchy are still relatively comfortable. So in this way, the \nredistribution of wealth is not \u201cunfair\u201d because it is a just correction to the luck that people were, \nor were not, born into. This system still has its flaws, however. Morality is still separate from the \ngovernment. This creates the same problem as before: when people feel like they do not owe \nanybody anything morally, it allows them to ignore others\u2019 problems. The solution to this seems \nto be in adding morality to the government, but how do we go about that? \n\u200b\nThe book mentions a type of moral responsibility that\u2019s not reflected in libertarianism or \nRawls\u2019 veil: obligations of solidarity. Basically, an obligation of solidarity is thinking about your \nlife story as connected and tied to the life stories of others. In other words, things that you did not \ndirectly cause or affect could still be with your moral responsibility to amend. For example, if \nAmerica formally apologized for its treatment of indigenous peoples, that would be an obligation \n\n \nof solidarity. Nobody living in America today was directly involved in the past wrongdoings that \nthe early American settlers inflicted upon the indigenous population. By apologizing, we can \nperhaps give a little peace of mind to the indigenous people and ensure that people learn from the \npast and improve. To say that America is obligated to give this apology is to argue that \nobligations of solidarity are valid and should be the law. Believing in these obligations is not \nsimply believing in charity, or that it would be nice if people were kind to one another; it is \nsaying that this is what we owe each other morally. This is a stark departure from the ideas of \nlibertarianism, and since our country is founded on libertarian principles, it can be tough for us to \nunderstand or accept this form of morality.  \nThe biggest potential issue with these obligations is their subjective nature. In choosing \nthese obligations, the government must take moral stances on certain issues. What do we owe \neach other, and to what extent? An example would be the issue of immigration. The argument \nthat immigration from Mexico into the US is bad because it lowers the standard of living here is \nnot arguing from the stance of humanity or neutrality; it's an argument from patriotism. If, for the \nsake of the argument, this stance is valid, the Mexican citizens\u2019 standard of living would \nincrease, to the detriment of the Americans\u2019. So in a world of vast disparities, how much does \none owe to their own country as opposed to everybody? By letting obligations of solidarity into \nlaw or society in this way, it allows morals to enter politics, which can be controversial. \nRawls argued that anyone who passed a moral law was effectively forcing their system of \nmorality upon everyone else (pg. 121). This case can certainly be made, but could it not also be \nmade for every other form of government or law? A law, by definition, forces people to do what \nthe country thinks is correct or safe, even if it is not the opinion of everyone. For example, \nautomatic weapons may be illegal, but semi-automatic weapons are legal. By passing that law, \n\n \nthe government is drawing a line between what is \u201callowed\u201d for the sake of public safety, but \nmany people may not agree with their stance. Some may believe that all guns are dangerous and \nshould be illegal, and others might argue that automatic weapons are not dangerous enough to be \nregulated by the government. But few would believe this law to be unjust simply because it \nforces the government\u2019s views; most objections would be about where that line was drawn. So \nthe argument that moral laws are bad because they force people\u2019s opinions is likely invalid, at \nleast to American standards. \nMany people are most likely in favor of morals in politics, but they only mean their own \nmorals. This is the true inherent problem. People disagree and do not want the opposite side\u2019s \nmorals to be enforced. For example: same sex marriage. Most people are either for or against \nsame-sex marriage and have opinions on whether it is a valid union, legally or morally. (Of \ncourse, there are the libertarians who believe it should be privatized, but I would think that is a \nsmall minority.) It is the same issue as the automatic weapons; people want there to be moral \nlaws in place, but they just want them to be based on their own morals. As a defender of morality \nin politics, it is important to be able to combat this criticism and come up with a fair way to \nimplement it. \nIn my view, there is a solution to this issue. I think that a majority of people want \nessentially the same things in regard to the morals of society. This may seem like an impossible \nposition to take, as we are constantly surrounded by contrasting views and no one can seem to \nagree about anything. But I think the issue involved with that is not morality, for the most part, \nbut instead: a lack of education. I believe that a great many views people hold (including some \nfrom me) are only held because of ignorance of the full extent of the view, or its consequences. \nFor example, the people who do not believe that systemic racism exists and therefore are against \n\n \nany laws that allow for equity for racial minorities; if they were to be educated on how it is most \ndefinitely real, and all of its effects, they may change their view on it. This effort is obviously \neasier said than done. In a time filled with widespread misinformation at the speed of a click and \na seemingly insurmountable amount of cognitive dissonance, voluntarily educating people on the \neffects (especially long-term) of certain laws or policies is extremely difficult. But if people can \nhave open minds to facts and other people\u2019s points of view, then I believe it would be possible to \nget many more people on the same page for a lot of potential moral laws. \nIn conclusion, although I agree with Rawls on a lot of issues, I think he is wrong in the \nviews he still holds from libertarianism. I believe morality should have a place in government, \nand improving education on these moral laws may help more people agree to pass them. We are \nnot a statistic, we are not an equation, we are not isolated; we are conscious, we transcend, and \nwe are all in this together. When we start thinking of ourselves as complex beings all connected \nin a web of other lives, we can start to understand how to make our society stronger and more \nmoral.",

        "text": "Samuel Halbrecht \nSOC 250-001 \n09/13/2025 \nDr. Engelman \n \n\u200b\nMichael J. Sandel\u2019s Justice: What\u2019s the right thing to do? It\u2019s more than just a philosophy \nbook, it is the opportunity to really think about what justice means for ourselves. The book takes \nus throughout some of the history of philosophical debate. Sandel uses these historical takes on \nphilosophy and ties them into real life dilemmas. This allows us to draw our own conclusions \nand decide for ourselves what is morally right for each individual situation. When I first read this \nbook, I was expecting it to be mostly philosophy focused. What I ended up finding was a way to \nnot only question what is morally correct, but redefine it all together. Sandel explores five main \nphilosophical frameworks, utilitarianism, libertarianism, Kant, Rawls, and Aristotle, and \nconnects them to real life experiences.  \n \nSandel starts off with the idea of what is right and what is wrong. He brings up the idea of \nprice gouging during natural disasters and the ethical and moral implications behind it. He wants \nthe reader to draw their own conclusion on where exactly to draw the line before it becomes \nruthless. From here, Sandel uses price gouging as an introduction into what exactly is right and \nwrong. He gives perspective to both sides, arguing that while some might find it morally \nincapable. If bottled water costs more, maybe people won't scalp and hoard it as much, and water \nbottle companies now have more incentive to rush shipments to affected areas. This is the \nwelfare idea, that it should be judged on the overall outcome, not how it got there. I personally \ndon't like the idea of profiting from desperation, and I think most people would agree with me. \n \n\n \nThe idea of this is that Sandel isn\u2019t trying to tell us what is right and what is wrong, he is trying \nto get us to use our instincts in order to draw these conclusions for ourselves. \n \nSandel begins with the idea of utilitarianism, the idea that the most ethical action \nproduces the greatest overall happiness for the greatest number of people. In his book, he talks \nabout famous philosophers like Bentham and Mill. He uses Bentham's claims that it can all be \nquantified, like calculation of morality. From his perspective, the right action will be what leaves \nthe world or public with the highest balance of happiness to dissatisfaction. John Stuart Mill sort \nof refines this viewpoint by distinguishing between exactly what the is being benefited and lost.  \nMill argues that certain benefits may be more valuable than others. Sandel presents these because \nthey are still relevant today. Many of Bentham\u2019s ideas are still shown in today\u2019s policy making \nlike sentencing and things like cost-benefit analyses. The idea of utilitarianism is that it gives us \nthe ability to handle hard tradeoffs that we as a society are constantly facing. During Covid for \nexample, the government had to weigh the overall happiness of the public against the welfare of \nthe public. To consider the utilitarian idea when assessing a problem, you have to ask yourself, \nwhich choice maximizes the overall well-being of the public, despite the consequences to get \nthere. Scientists do this all the time when assessing things like safety controls, or protocols. They \nassess how many lives it saves, despite how many it may cost in order to justify their reasoning.  \n \n\u200b\nSandel argues that utilitarianism is far from a perfect system and I agree. One glaring \nweakness of utilitarianism is the idea that only caring about the sum of happiness and overall \nsatisfaction can lead to oversights and risks trampling on certain people\u2019s individual rights. He \nreferences the idea that in ancient Rome, they would throw the Christian\u2019s to the lions in order to \n\n \namuse the crowd and raise the overall happiness for everyone. But by doing so, it destroyed the \nindividual human innate rights of those christians. It feels wrong, not only because of the \nconsequences of those people dying, but because it disrupts the balance between what is good \nand what is evil. Another weakness of utilitarianism is the idea that everything can be measured \non a single scale. Is it morally acceptable to judge the happiness of someone\u2019s friendship perhaps \nwith someone\u2019s happiness for life? Sandel suggests that some values just can\u2019t be compared. For \nexample, if I get called by a friend at 4 in the morning to pick him up at a bar because he is afraid \nto drive, can I compare my happiness for good quality sleep to his happiness for safety and life? \nHow about the happiness for safety of anyone else on the road that night. In my own experience I \ncan see the idea of utilitarianism in my own everyday decisions. My point is that some things just \ncan\u2019t be compared equally.  \n \nSandel also explores the idea of libertarianism and the right to choose and limit freedoms. \nIt focuses less on the collective happiness of the public, and puts more weight on the rights of the \nindividual. He argues that from this perspective, we are all our own person and have the freedom \nto do what we want with our lives and property so long as it doesn\u2019t negatively affect others. I \nreally like this viewpoint because it resonates with the natural idea that my time and my body are \nmine to control and no one else's. It puts forth the idea that the freedom of choice is what makes \na society just, not the actions that are taken. Sandel really forces us to put this to the test and see \nif it\u2019s true in all cases. Sandel talks about the volunteer army ____. He argues that on the surface \nit might seem fair because the individual person is the one choosing to enlist, but in reality the \nmajority of the people enlisting come from poor or desperate communities where enlisting in the \n\n \narmy might be the only opportunity for them.Sandel wants us to think is this choice really \nvoluntary is it a choice of necessity. Can unequal conditions truly undermine freedom? \n \n\u200b\nThis idea of the right to choose really made me think of college students. I have many \nfriends and colleagues that feel they were forced into certain majors or jobs not because it brings \nthem the most satisfaction but because of societal or familial pressures from within. While on \npaper it may seem they are choosing their path, in reality their options are possibly limited by \ncertain inequalities like financial needs or expectations. A libertarian might argue that this is still \na choice, but Sandel pushes us to see that certain freedoms only have real meaning when the \nconditions behind are truly fair. This is one of the reasons why Sandel criticizes libertarianism as \nan incomplete system. \n \n\u200b\nAfter this, Sandel shifts into the ideas of Immanuel Kant, who has a completely different \nperspective on things. Kant argues that morality is not about maximizing happiness or even \nprotecting people\u2019s freedom of choice. He believes that the true level of morality lies in our \nmotives, not our actions. He argues that an action should be judged not on the outcome of said \naction, but on the reason behind it. Kant introduces two main ideas that I believe are important. \nThe principle of universalization, in which you should only act on a rule that you would want \neveryone else to follow. The second idea is we cannot use people as tools in order to get what we \nwant, no matter how beneficial the outcome may be. Every individual has dignity and that \ndignity must be respected. \n \n\n \nKant\u2019s perspective also challenges the idea of utilitarianism. His famous thought experiment \nabout lying to a murderer if they ask where my friend is hiding. The utilitarian perspective might \nsay that lying is the right choice because it saves your friend\u2019s life, but Kant argues that lying is \nalways wrong because it violates the person\u2019s dignity and right to the truth, and treats the \nmurderer as not rational. It definitely seems like an extreme example, but Kant\u2019s idea isn\u2019t about \nbending the rules in order to ensure a positive outcome, it\u2019s about holding ourselves accountable \nto the idea that we treat everyone with respect. \n \n\u200b\nAfter Kant, Sandel introduces the ideas of John Rawls. Rawls argues that justice should \nnot be about maximizing happiness or protecting freedoms, but instead wants us to think about it \nfrom a third party perspective. He calls this the \u201cveil of ignorance.\u201d This thought process asks us \nto come up with the rules for a just society without knowing who we would be in the society. \nRawls believes that if that were the case, we would choose a society that is more fair for \neveryone since no one wants to gamble on themselves ending up in a poor societal position. I \nfind this perspective to be really important because it forces me to confront the role of luck in my \nown life to be born a white American male. None of us choose who we were born as, our \nfamilies, or even what value we have to society. Rawls says that these are morally arbitrary, and \nthat justice requires us to correct that. Thinking about myself, I realize how much of my life \ndepended on circumstances out of my control. If I had been born into a less than favorable \nsituation, I would want society structured fairly in order to give me a fair shot. That is what \nRawls is aiming for. \n \n\n \n\u200b\nIn the final chapters, Aristotle argues that justice is teleological, meaning the end goal or \npurpose of a practice determines what is just. To figure out what\u2019s fair, we have to ask ourselves \nwhat the purpose of something is. Aristotle also says that justice is honorific, meaning that \ndeciding what is just involves deciding what virtues we want to reward. Sandel connects this to \nmodern debates like same sex marriage where the disagreement isnt only about the freedom of \nchoice, but the purpose behind marriage. This framework is important because it reminds us that \njustice isn't morally neutral. Unlike the libertarian perspective, Aristotle thinks that justice \nalways points us towards what is right, and that politics is where we can reason about what \nexactly is right. If we only talk about the efficiency behind decisions, or the individual rights that \nare affected, we miss the important things, in what kind of virtues and morals we want to build \nour society around.  \n \n\u200b\nUltimately, Sandel doesn\u2019t give us one finite answer about what justice is, instead he \nshows us that justice is a conversation that we have as a society. The willingness to ask the \nimportant questions of not just what works, but what is ultimately right. For me, living justly is \nnot only about defending my own rights, but really about thinking of what kind of society I not \nonly want to live in, but what society I want to help create. Justice is not a set of rules, but a \nplatform for us as scholars to continue asking and answering these questions. In that sense, the \nimportant of Sandel\u2019s work is not just about the theories he lays out, but the dialogue he creates.",

        "text": "Karissa Athas \nSoc-250-001 \n15 September 2025 \nWhat Do We Owe One Another? / Dilemmas of Loyalty  \nMichael Sandel is a political philosopher and a professor at Harvard University. He is \nknown for diving into the world of moral and political philosophies and how they apply to \neveryday life. He is also best known for being the author of \u201cJustice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To \nDo?\u201d. He is admired for his knowledge of philosophy and making it more easily accessible \nthrough his classes and book, inspiring each new generation of students. As well as being great at \nconnecting real world issues and having enlightening debates. Sandel\u2019s book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s \nThe Right Thing To Do?\u201d is thought provoking and a great way for people to learn and reflect on \nmorals and philosophies in society in a non-bias way. From the ideas of philosophers like Kant, \nRawls, and Aristotle, Sandel developed a deeper understanding of justice. Sandel applied these \nideas to society through discussions of ethics, morality, and politics.  \nModern liberal philosophy emphasizes equal moral obligations to all people. All our lived \nexperiences say something different. It is shaped by our personal loyalties to family, friends, \ncommunity and nation. I chose chapter nine, What Do We Owe One Another? / Dilemmas of \nLoyalty because it stuck out to me the most. Specifically, apologies and reparations, should we \natone for the sins of our predecessors and moral individualism are what I found to be most \ninteresting in the chapter. This chapter goes into how our sense of right and wrong is not merely \nbased on universal rules. Sandel dives into loyalty, history and community, and how it shapes \nwhat people feel they owe to others.  \n\nSandel opens the chapter by discussing public apologies for past wrongs. He uses the \nexample of Germany apologizing for the past wrongs the country did by recognizing the \nHolocaust, and Japan\u2019s contrasting approach by being reluctant to apologize. Sandel goes on to \nsay, \u201cGermany has paid the equivalent of billions of dollars in reparations for the Holocaust, in \nthe form of payments to individual survivors and to the state of Israel. Over the years, German \npolitical leaders have offered statements of apology, accepting responsibility for the Nazi past in \nvarying degrees\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). This shows the nation\u2019s willingness to confront its past, \nreshape its identity, and express a genuine desire for reconciliation. Unlike Japan who took a \ndifferent approach, \u201cJapan has been more reluctant to apologize for its wartime atrocities... Since \nthe 1990s, Japan has faced growing international pressure for a formal apology and restitution to \nthe so-called \u201ccomfort women.\u201d ... Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe insisted that the Japanese \nmilitary was not responsible for coercing the women into sexual slavery\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). These \ndiffering approaches raise important questions about how nations and individuals should take \nresponsibility for past injustices. And whether sincere apologies can help heal historical wounds. \nIn the text I found these two examples to be good models for how a nation can handle their past. \nA question I still have is whether gestures like apologies and reparations truly matter without \nsignificant change behind them. Who gets to decide when an apology is enough and what \nhappens if it is too late or doesn\u2019t go far enough? \nA relevant example that I have found in my own community is when there were racially \nrestrictive covenants discovered in property deeds on Boston's North Shore. My family owns \nproperties in the Boston area and are of Greek decent. Recently, I heard the news of these \nproperty deeds having racially restrictive covenants that include people of, \u201cNegro, Jewish, \nItalian, Greek, Polish or Armenian blood\u201d (Farrar). It was absolutely shocking to read that these \n\ndeeds still had such racist and discriminatory language in them. The good news is Harborlight \nHomes, and the North Shore NAACP had discovered them and took action to erase these racially \nrestrictive covenants. Change is thankfully being done, \u201cHarborlight Homes and the NAACP \nwere able to find the racial covenants on the North Shore with the help of the Mapping Prejudice \nProject based at the University of Minnesota Libraries... In 2019, Harborlight provided the \nMapping Prejudice Project with property records from the Southern Essex County Registry of \nDeeds... Local volunteers are now going through the deeds to see if the language still exists in \nthe current or most recent deeds for the properties. Harborlight and the NAACP said they will \nassist homeowners who want to erase the language from their deeds\u201d (Leighton). I think \nHarborlight and the NAACP are taking the correct steps in correcting the situation and finding a \nsolution. \nFurthermore, in chapter nine Sandel approached the next section by discussing \u201cshould \nwe atone for the sins of our predecessors\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). He touched upon different political \nfigures who debated on taking accountability for past actions they were not involved in. One \nexample of this is, \u201cJohn Howard, the Australian prime minister, gave this reason for rejecting an \nofficial apology to the aborigines: \u201cI do not believe that the current generation of Australians \nshould formally apologize and accept responsibility for the deeds of an earlier generation\u201d \n(Sandel, Ch. 9). I see the perspective in this argument; how can the people of today be held to the \nmistakes or wrongdoing of those before them? The section gives another example on this side of \nthe debate, \u201cWhen the New Jersey state legislature debated the apology question in 2008, a \nRepublican assemblyman asked, \u201cWho living today is guilty of slaveholding and thus capable of \napologizing for the offense?\u201d The obvious answer, he thought, was no one: \u201cToday\u2019s residents of \nNew Jersey, even those who can trace their ancestry back to . . . slaveholders, bear no collective \n\nguilt or responsibility for unjust events in which they personally played no role\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). \nThis raises an important point about the distinction between collective guilt and collective \nresponsibility. These concepts are crucial to the question of whether people today should take \nresponsibility for the past actions of their society or nation. Furthermore, while the argument that \npeople of today are not responsible for the past I disagree. It makes sense from an individualistic \nperspective but fails to recognize the bigger picture. Society was shaped from the past and still \nhas overlapping affects happening today. To completely disregard how and what choices were \nmade is to neglect the people who are still suffering from generational trauma and setbacks due \nto the past. Even if we are not personally guilty for the past, I think it is still important to \nacknowledge the wrong doings and be proactive to make improvements.  \nLastly, Sandel touches upon moral individualism, meaning individuals are only \nresponsible for their own actions and not for the actions of others or for historical events beyond \ntheir control. Sandel wrote, moral individualism is, \u201cIt rests on the notion that we are responsible \nonly for what we ourselves do, not for the actions of other people, or for events beyond our \ncontrol. We are not answerable for the sins of our parents or our grandparents or, for that matter, \nour compatriots\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). This idea could sound fair in theory, but I personally find it \nflawed.  If people were only concerned with their own actions and did not take responsibility for \nthe society they inherit, I think society could not morally function. Sandel brings in an argument \nin favor of moral individualism, \u201cImmanuel Kant offered a more powerful version of the \nchoosing self. Against the utilitarian and empiricist philosophers, Kant argued that we must think \nof ourselves as more than a bundle of preferences and desires. To be free is to be autonomous, \nand to be autonomous is to be governed by a law I give myself. Kantian autonomy is more \ndemanding than consent. When I will the moral law, I don\u2019t simply choose according to my \n\ncontingent desires or allegiances. Instead, I step back from my particular interests and \nattachments and will as a participant in pure practical reason\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). This opinion fails \nto recognize that people are social beings and not truly individualistic. This overlooks how \npeople are intertwin with one another and a part of society. People have strong morals, \nrelationships and families, we are not simply individuals but also social creatures. Sandel also \nhas a point against moral individualism, \u201c...freedom leaves little room for collective \nresponsibility, or for a duty to bear the moral burden of historic injustices perpetrated by our \npredecessors\u201d (Sandel, Ch. 9). I agree with this quote, many takes on moral individualism fail to \ntruly acknowledge the past. He debates, if we only recognize obligations we choose, we risk \nignoring the remaining effects of past injustices and the moral ties that connect us to people \naround us. This perfectly sums up my opinion as well about collective responsibility and how we \nare all connected as people and past, present and future. Moral individualism is appealing can \nseem fair because it says we should only be responsible for what we personally do. It protects \npeople from being blamed for things they didn\u2019t cause. But this idea can become a problem when \nit\u2019s used to ignore the unfair systems we still benefit from today. An example of this is even if a \nperson today didn\u2019t create slavery they could to this day still be benefitting from it. If people did \nnot take responsibility for the past nothing would change or improve. Justice needs us to take a \ndeeper look into societal issues and the bigger picture, not just stay in our own bubbles.  \nLastly, Sandel\u2019s examination of moral responsibility, loyalty, and justice make us think \nfurther and outside of our own bubbles. Chapter nine brought up important points such as, what \ndo we owe to one another, should we feel responsible for injustices we didn\u2019t personally commit. \nEven though moral individualism can be appealing, it can also be used to avoid difficult realities. \n\nI believe that true justice means not only having individual accountability but also knowing that \nwe are all connected to each other by history, community, and shared responsibility.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSources \nFarrar, Molly. \u201cHundreds of \u201cDirty\u201d North Shore Property Deeds Will Be \u201cCleaned\u201d of Racist \nLanguage.\u201d Boston.com, 6 Aug. 2025, www.boston.com/news/local-\nnews/2025/08/05/hundreds-of-dirty-north-shore-property-deeds-will-be-cleaned-of-\nracist-language/.

        "text": "Weber 1 \nSam Weber \nProfessor Engelman \nSOC 345 \n24 October 2025 \nThe New Normal: What American Families Might Look Like in 2035 \n \nOver the past century, the \u201ctypical\u201d American family has transformed \nsubstantially.  From the postwar nuclear family of the 1950s where there were the male \nbreadwinners and stay-at-home mothers to today\u2019s melting pot of family structures, we as \na country have seen every type of family and we continue to see more growth.  \nSociologists have seen a long but steady decline in the traditional marital households, and \nwith the trending rates of inclusivity in America, there has been a rise in diversity across \ngender, sexuality and caregiving roles.  Some key shifts that will be recognized are the \ndecline in marriage rates, an increase in participation of mothers working, and the \ngrowing societal norm of same-sex parenting.  As we think about from now to the year \n2035, this essay forecasts how these new trends will likely reshape the \u201ctypical\u201d \nAmerican family while simultaneously challenging the old hegemonic ideals, \nhighlighting greater shift in inclusivity for America.   \n \n Firstly, marriage has steadily declined in popularity, especially among younger \ngenerations rising.  The share of married households fell below 50% for the first time, \n\u201cwhile cohabiting, never married, or divorced individuals represent a growing portion of \nadults\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau).  The causes of this may be related to an evolving self-\n\nWeber 2 \nworth, shifting gender roles, and student debt.  To some people, marriage has lost its \nmeaning and it is more of just a label, especially to the younger generations.  By 2035, \nbased off the trending rates, marriage will likely continue to lose its importance as the \nprimary maker of adult stability.  Now this does not take away to the fact that marriage is \nstill persistent among more privilege groups including college educated couples, \ncohabitants, unions, and other arrangements where it may be more common.  We could \nsee a rise in a more \u201cunfair and outdated\u201d system which may cause some issues in the \nfuture public eye.  With this constant decrease and the rise of nontraditional partnerships, \nit can be inferred that in ten years this shift will likely cause new laws to be made to \nrecognize and support other types of families and not just legally married heterosexual \ncouples.  As traditional marriage becomes less central to family life, these shifts have also \nreshaped who provides for the home.  This continues to be a new era where working \nmothers are increasing this norm rather than accepting history.   \n \nThe entrance of women in the workforce, especially mothers, has been one of the \nmost important shifts in modern American Family dynamics.  Mothers with children \n\u201cunder 18 years old had a labor force participation rate of 71.7 percent in 2021, up from \nless than half (47.4 percent) in 1975.\u201d (USAFacts).  The COVID-19 pandemic did \ntemporarily disrupt these gains, but long-term trends show a consistent rise in mothers \nentering the workforce, with heavy trends leaning toward single mothers and dual-income \nhouseholds.  By 2035, the stay-at-home motherhood will be relatively a rare choice and \nthe dual model of income will slowly shift into a norm.  On the other side of this topic, \nDoucet also mentioned from his reading that \u201cstay-at-home fathers are now forging new \nmasculinities,\u201d redefining caregiving as a masculine trait.  This is still definitely a \n\nWeber 3 \nminority practice today, but in ten years we could see this could be more common with a \nbroader societal social and institutional support for paternity leave, flexible work \nschedules, and sharing roles around the house within family dynamics.  As more mothers \nhave joined the workforce out of both choice and maybe with it being necessary, another \nopportunity shift has begun that can be related: it is the steady rise of single parent \nhouseholds, which now are a large portion of the American family ideals.   \n \nThe negative label that surrounds single parenthood is slowly diminishing.  Single \nmothers, especially women of color continue to face societal and structural challenges \nsuch as less income, less flexibility within jobs and scheduling, and not a lot of access to \naffordable childcare.  Even with this, because of the positive progress society has made, \nthe number of single parent households has steadily increased, driven by a few factors \nincluding choice, societal acceptance, and delayed marriage.  By 2035, single parenthood \nby choice OR circumstance will be normalized at a vast rate compared to how it is now.  \nThere will be a broader acceptance of unmarried parenthood, causing more single parent \nsituations, especially women, to parent independently.  With improved social services, it \nwill make that job easier to parent independently.  On the other hand, blended families, \nwhich form through remarriage, could be a new normal in the future.  Children growing \nup in 2035 will most likely have a higher chance to have \u201chalf siblings\u201d, stepparents, or \nnon-biological caregivers in general, which is not the best thing, but these family forms \nwill challenge the legal system to adapt and expand definitions of rights beyond just \nblood related frame works.  The fact that the marriage rate is decrease is not the best, but \nit is creating new opportunities and Richard Bach explains in a way where \u201cthe bond that \nlinks your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other\u201d (Happier \n\nWeber 4 \nHuman).  This demonstrates that blood does not mean everything, and that this \nmovement does not all have to be bad.  As family structures grow more fluid and diverse, \nas said, society is slowly rethinking traditional definitions of parenthood, which brings \nalong another aspect of inclusivity, particularly among LGBTQ+ families.   \n \nSince the 2015 Supreme Court decision Obegefell v. Hodges, same-sex marriage \nhas been legalized in America, which has opened a door that many have accepted in the \npast years.  Since then, there has been greater visibility for those who were not being \nsupported with that style of marriage in mind.  Unfortunately, as Moore states, these \n\u201cfamilies still navigate institutional barriers\u201d, particularly in adoption, birth, and \nschooling, and being biological parents.  By 2035, same sex families will continue to \nchange parenting norms, especially gay male couples because they cannot fill the \ntraditional \u201cbiological mother\u201d role.  These dynamics will help with the inclusivity of \ncreating this type of co-parenting across all family types.  We can also expect growing in \nall of LGBTQ+ marriages including transgender and non-binary parents.  As legal and \ncultural normal settle in, family diversity in 2035 will likely have a wide spectrum of \ngender identities.  As these types of families continue to challenge norms and reshape \nparenthood, it is all part of one big goal, what everybody is curious about, what the \nAmerican family will look like in the future.   \n \nIn conclusion, if we were to look ahead and envision a \u201ctypical\u201d American family \nin 2035, it would completely be different from the nuclear model on a heterosexual \nmarried couple with biological children.  Instead, we can infer that one of the most \ncommon family dynamics you will see is a dual-income household where both parents, \nregardless of gender share caregiving duties.  We can predict that just as likely, there \n\nWeber 5 \ncould be a single parent raising children with the help of a kin, or a same sex couple \nraising adopted or a donor child, and maybe even a blended family attempting to handle \nco-parenting with multiple houses.  In these cases, and soon, families will be structured \nmore by intention and emotional commitment than by blood or legal marriage.  This \nprogress and emerging norms will not only challenge the legal system but will change the \ndynamics of how society sees parenthood, custody, and family rights.  By 2035, the \nAmerican family will not be defined by a single \u201cnorm\u201d or \u201cimage\u201d, but its inclusivity, \ndiversity, and change.  It will set society into a transition, one with hospitality, support, \nand commitment become the true foundations of family instead of legal contracts and \ngender roles.   \n \n \n\nWeber 6 \nWorks Cited \nDoucet, Andrea. *Do Men Mother?: Fathering, Care, and Domestic Responsibility*. \nUniversity of Toronto Press, 2006. \nDoucet, Andrea. \u201cFathering it\u2019s almost like I have a job\u201d.

        "text": "Madi Chester \nSoc - 250-300 \n18 September 2025 \nReflection #1 \nIn Chapters 9-10 of Michael Sandel\u2019s Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?, the focus is \non economic inequality, the role of markets in society, and moral questions about fairness and \njustice. Sandel draws heavily on John Rawls\u2019 idea, especially the difference principle, which \nsays that inequalities are only fair if they help the least advantaged. He also examines the limits \nof markets, asking whether all goods and social activities should be bought and sold or left \noutside market influence. \nReading these chapters prompted me to reflect on my own experiences and beliefs \nregarding fairness, opportunity, and community. I realized that Sandel\u2019s ideas are not just \ntheories. They affect how we live, learn, and interact. In particular, I have come to understand \nhow diversity in education has shaped my perspective on fairness and equity, helping me \nappreciate different viewpoints and recognize the broader impact of inequality.  \nOne part that really hit me was the tension Sandel describes between meritocracy and \nfairness. He questions the idea that the people who succeed the most automatically deserve their \nrewards. This made me think about my own schooling. Growing up, I sat in classrooms with \nstudents from all different backgrounds, cultures, family situations, and life experiences. I \nnoticed how much diversity improved my learning. I also realized that diversity didn't just make \nme a better student but also made me a better person. Sandals' point about meritocracy helped me \nconnect those classroom experiences to learning that fairness isn't about rewarding only the top \nperformers but about creating conditions where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.  \n\n \nMy high school experience also connects to Sandel's ideas about meritocracy and \nfairness. I was at a school where you had to pry your way to the top. I attended one of the only \ntwo schools in my district that offered the International Baccalaureate program. Out of the twelve \nschools in the district, my school quickly became known as the most competitive one. Where \nsuccess was measured almost entirely by GPA, test scores, and how many AP or IB classes you \nwere taking. In my graduating class, the IB cohort alone had nearly a hundred students, where \nmost of them finished in the top 10% of my class. This created an environment where students \noften felt judged if their GPA was under a 4.0, as if anything less meant they weren't working \nhard enough or weren't as capable.  \nAnother example is from an education class I took at UNCW, where a black student \nshared her experiences in the classroom. During a discussion where everyone went around \ntalking about their educational backgrounds, her story really stood out. She told me about the \nchallenges she faced growing up in less privileged schools and how those experiences shaped her \nopportunities. Hearing her perspective made me realize how differently students' starting points \ncan affect their education. It challenged me to think about fairness in a deeper way, not just as \ntreating everyone the same but as making sure everyone gets a real chance to succeed. Her story \nstayed with me and changed the way I think about diversity, opportunity, and the responsibility \nwe all have to recognize and address inequality.  \nDiversity also helped me think about merit in a different way. In classrooms where \nstudents start from different points, rewarding only grades or test scores can actually make \ninequalities worse. Being in a diverse classroom helped me grow not just academically but also \nemotionally. I learned empathy, critical thinking, and a better understanding of fairness. I began \nto see that the \u201cmerit\u201d is not just about who scores the highest or gets into the most advanced \n\n \nprogram but it's also about reliance, creativity, and the unique perspectives people bring to the \ngroup. Some of the most impactful classmates I learned from weren't always the ones with the \nhighest GPAs but the ones who could explain concepts differently, share personal experiences \nthat related to the topic, or challenge the class to think beyond the textbook. \nThese lessons aren't just learned inside the classroom. They happen outside of school too. \nLast year, my roommate, who is now one of my closest friends, is black, and we often had \nconversations about not only our very different educational experiences but also life outside of \nschool. I had never met someone so insightful and well-rounded until I met her. She shared with \nme how difficult life has been for her because of the color of her skin. While I've never judged \nanyone based on race, hearing her stories reminded me that many people do, and the things she \nhas endured were heartbreaking. She never deserved the hateful comments or treatment she has \nfaced. Her experiences helped me realize how important it is to listen, empathize, and to \nrecognize the ways privilege affects everyday life. It also made me more aware of standing up \nagainst injustice when I see it.  \n \nLooking back, I see how these personal conversations connect directly with Sandel's \npoint about fairness. Privilege is not something we notice when we have it, but its impact is very \nreal for the people who don't. Justice, as Sandel explains, requires us to think beyond our own \nsuccesses and ask how our systems either help or harm the least advantaged. My roommate's \nstory gave me a firsthand view of what inequality looks like in daily life, and it motivated me to \ntake responsibility for how I respond to it.  \nAnother part that stood out to me was Sandel\u2019s discussion about markets. He says some \nthings, like education or civic duties, shouldn't be treated just like products to buy and sell. I \n\n \nagree that schools often feel like competitions where grades and test scores define value. I've \nseen students struggle when they don't have the same resources as others. Sandel's point \nreminded me that fairness and ethical responsibility matter more than just rewards. Students are \ntreated almost like products who have to compete for rankings, scholarships, or acceptance into \nprograms. Standardized testing, college admissions, and even class ranking all turn learning into \na system where value is determined by numbers. While this system can motivate some students \nto work hard, it also creates pressure and leaves many behind. Especially for those who don't \nhave access to private tutors, stable home environments, or extra resources. This reflects what \nSandel warns against, letting market logic dominate areas of life that should instead be guided by \nfairness, equality, and shared responsibility.  \nAt the same time, I recognize that markets can motivate growth and innovation, but they \ncan't govern everything. In my education, the balance between merit-based rewards and fair \nopportunities for all students made a big difference. Class discussions, group projects, and \nteachers who valued diverse experiences made diversity a strength, not a disadvantage. I realized \nthat when schools focus only on competition, it leaves many students behind. But when schools \nfocus on collaboration, everyone rises together.  \nReflecting on these chapters, I realize that fairness is not just about treating everyone the \nsame but about recognizing differences in opportunities and starting points. Sandals' emphasis on \nthe difference principle encourages us to consider how society can structure itself so that even \nthose with fewer advantages can thrive. My own experiences with diversity have shown me that \nclassrooms and communities are richer when we listen to each other's stories and support fair \nopportunities. It's clear that fairness requires awareness and empathy.  \n\n \nSandals' ideas about markets also showed me that not everything in life should be treated \nlike a business deal or a competition. Things like education, community involvement, and \nrelationships, and a deeper value that money can't measure. My own experiences in diverse \nclassrooms proved this to me. When students worked together, shared their different viewpoints, \nand respected each other, everyone gained more than they could have on their own. I've come to \nrealize that real success isn't just about personal achievements, but about building a community \nwhere everyone has the opportunity to grow and succeed.  \nThese chapters also strengthened my belief in the importance of diversity, empathy, and \nresponsibility. They reminded me that justice isn't just an idea, it's someone who affects how we \ntreat people, how schools and communities are run, and what opportunities are available. \nApplying Sandel's ideas in my own life means paying attention to privilege, speaking up against \nunfairness, and supporting fairness in everyday ways. I want to live in a world where success is \nnot measured only by what one person achieves but also by how much we help and support each \nother. Applying Sandel's ideas in my own life means paying closer attention to privilege, \nrecognizing that some of the opportunities I've had were not available to everyone. For instance, \nbeing able to attend a school with advanced academic programs or having teachers who \nencouraged me was a privilege that not every student experiences. Sandel\u2019s work showed me that \njustice is about building a world where people are not left behind, where diversity is celebrated, \nand where empathy and fairness are at the core of decision-making. By striving to live this way i \nhope i can contribute to a society that reflects the values of fairness and justice that Sandel \ndescribes.",

        "text": "Midterm Paper \nSociologists study family dynamics not merely to describe the present but to anticipate future \ntransformations. Over the past three decades, the American family has undergone significant \nstructural changes. These shifts include a decline in marriage rates, increased labor force \nparticipation among mothers, a rise in single-parent and blended households, and greater \nvisibility and legal recognition of LGBTQ+ families. By examining contemporary evidence and \nconsidering social, economic, and policy mechanisms, we can project how families might evolve \nby 2035. Three baseline facts shape the projection. First, marriage as the model living \narrangement has been eroding. The share of US adults who are married has fallen substantially \nsince the 1990s, while cohabitation and non-partnered living has grown. Female labor force \nparticipation, especially among mothers with children, remains a central reality shaping family \nlife a large majority of American families now include at least one employed member, and \nmother's employment patterns have changed substantially over recent decades, both in terms of \nparticipation and distribution of full-time versus part-time work. Employment trends in families \ninfluence choices about marriage, childbearing, and household labor. Household composition has \nalso become more complex. More children live in single parent or multi-partner family \narrangements and a substantial share of cohabitation. Cohabitating couples include children from \nprior relationships. (Bureau, 2023) reports that more than one in five cohabitating opposite sex \ncouples in recent years include at least one partner who had children with multiple partners \nevidence of how family ties increasingly change household boundaries. \n             Factors perpetuating current shifts in family dynamics include all time low birth rates in \ntheUS, sexuality and gender inequalities, and economy. Fertility rates right now are the lowest in \nall of US history according to (Morse, 2023). Despite the overall decline, there is a growing \n\n \n \n \n \ntrend of intentional parenting, where individuals and couples are making deliberate decisions \nabout when and how many children to have. Advances in reproductive technologies, such as in \nvitro fertilization (IVF), have also provided more options for family planning. By 2035, it is \nanticipated that family planning will be more individualized, with greater access to reproductive \nhealth services and support for diverse family-building options. This reduction is attributed to \nfactors such as career prioritization, economic considerations, and personal choice. While some \nview this as a challenge to traditional family models, others see it as an opportunity for \nredefining family success and fulfillment. LGBTQ+ families have become an integral part of the \nAmerican family landscape. Approximately 191,000 children are being raised by two same-sex \nparents, and about 29% of LGBTQ adults are raising a child under 18, (Family Equitability, \n2021). This visibility has led to greater social acceptance and legal recognition of diverse family \nstructures. However, disparities persist. Rates of marriage among LGBTQ parents vary by race \nand ethnicity, with White LGBTQ parents having higher marriage rates compared to their \ncounterparts. These differences underscore the need for continued advocacy and policy efforts to \nensure equality and support for all family forms. For instance, many individuals are prioritizing \ncareer advancement and financial stability over traditional marital commitments. Additionally, \nthe stigma associated with remaining single has diminished, leading to a more diverse array of \nfamily structures. By 2035, it is anticipated that marriage will no longer be the predominant \nmodel for family formation. Instead, cohabitation and other forms of partnerships will become \nmore prevalent, reflecting a broader acceptance of diverse relationship models. The rise in dual-\nincome households has led to changes in domestic responsibilities, with men increasingly \nsharing in household chores and child-rearing tasks. However, challenges persist, such as the \nhigh cost of childcare and workplace policies that may not fully support work-life balance. By \n\n \n \n \n \n2035, it is projected that workplace policies will have evolved to better accommodate the needs \nof working parents, including flexible work arrangements and comprehensive parental leave, \nfacilitating a more equitable distribution of domestic responsibilities. \n             In 2035, the American family will likely be characterized by diversity and adaptability. \nTraditional nuclear families will coexist with a variety of other structures, including single-\nparent households, cohabiting couples, and LGBTQ+ families. Technology will play a \nsignificant role in family dynamics, with digital communication facilitating connections across \ndistances and enabling new forms of co-parenting and support networks. Economic factors will \ncontinue to influence family decisions. Access to affordable housing, healthcare, and childcare \nwill be critical in shaping family formation and stability. Policy interventions that support work-\nlife balance, parental leave, and equitable access to resources will be essential in fostering \nenvironments where diverse family structures can thrive. \n             I think economic factors will continue to influence family decisions. Access to \naffordable housing, healthcare, and childcare will be critical in shaping family formation and \nstability. Policy interventions that support work-life balance, parental leave, and equitable access \nto resources will be essential in fostering environments where diverse family structures can \nthrive. The American family in 2035 will reflect the complexities and nuances of contemporary \nsociety. While the decline in marriage rates and the rise of diverse family structures may \nchallenge traditional notions of family, they also present opportunities for redefining familial \nbonds and support systems. By embracing diversity and implementing supportive policies, \nsociety can ensure that all families, regardless of structure, have the resources and recognition \nthey need to flourish. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nBureau, U.

        "text": "Reflection  \nMax Carlson \nProfessor Engelman  \nSOC-250-001 \nJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? By Michael J. Sandel \nMichael J. Sandel\u2019s Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? is one of those rare books that \ninvites you to slow down and really wrestle with what you believe about right, wrong, freedom, \nand fairness. Sandel doesn\u2019t just lay out theories of justice\u2014he asks you to live with them, test \nthem, and see how they hold up when applied to real-world dilemmas. His examples\u2014from \ntrolley problems to debates over price gouging, same-sex marriage, and affirmative \naction\u2014force readers to go beyond surface-level opinions and think carefully about why they \nbelieve what they believe. As someone who leans libertarian, I naturally gravitate toward \narguments that prioritize individual freedom, property rights, and personal responsibility, \nbecause I see those as the foundation of a just society. But what I appreciate about Sandel is \nthat he doesn\u2019t let anyone, libertarians included, off the hook. He challenges every perspective \nfairly, highlighting not just its strengths but also its weaknesses and blind spots. By bringing in \nmultiple philosophical frameworks\u2014utilitarianism, virtue ethics, Rawlsian egalitarianism\u2014Sandel \nshows how each one has something meaningful to contribute to our understanding of justice, \neven if we don\u2019t fully agree with them. This book didn\u2019t just confirm my beliefs; it pushed me to \nclarify why I hold them, to see where my framework might fall short, and to stay open to refining \nmy views in light of new arguments and moral considerations. \nReading Sandel\u2019s exploration of libertarianism felt both familiar and validating. He explains the \nlibertarian position as one that seeks to keep the state neutral about competing conceptions of \nthe good life, focusing instead on protecting individual rights and voluntary exchange. That \nresonated with me because I believe people should have as much freedom as possible to live \nas they choose, so long as they aren\u2019t harming others. The idea that government should not \nimpose one group\u2019s vision of morality on everyone else is central to how I see a just society \nfunctioning. At the same time, Sandel doesn\u2019t let libertarians stop at the abstract principle of \nfreedom\u2014he challenges us to think through situations where pure freedom might produce \noutcomes that seem intuitively unjust or even harmful. For example, he raises questions about \nprice gouging and whether it is truly just to let markets run wild in the aftermath of natural \ndisasters, when people are desperate for basic goods like water or shelter. His discussion made \nme pause and consider whether unfettered markets always serve justice, or whether there are \ntimes when temporary restrictions might be justified to protect the most vulnerable. I still believe \nthat market freedom is a cornerstone of prosperity and human flourishing, but Sandel\u2019s \nexamples helped me see that some reasonable limits could actually support human dignity and \nprevent exploitation rather than threaten freedom. \n\nThe key topics Sandel explores\u2014distribution of wealth, the morality of markets, affirmative \naction, military service, and the meaning of marriage\u2014are all issues that force you to slow down \nand confront what you value most. These are not abstract debates; they are questions that cut \nto the heart of how we want to live together in society. When he discusses equality and Rawls\u2019s \ndifference principle, for example, I found myself thinking deeply about the tension between \nfairness and freedom. Rawls argues that inequalities are acceptable only if they benefit the least \nadvantaged members of society, which is a compelling way of reframing justice around shared \nresponsibility. As a libertarian, my instinct is to protect property rights and voluntary exchange \nabove all else, but Sandel\u2019s discussion made me consider how extreme inequality might not just \nbe an economic problem but a moral one\u2014one that can erode opportunity, foster resentment, \nand weaken the social bonds that hold a community together. Justice, then, might not be only \nabout what we have a right to do or to own, but also about what we owe one another as \nmembers of a shared society, especially when our choices impact others in ways we cannot \nignore. \n \nOne of the most personally meaningful sections of the book for me was Sandel\u2019s discussion of \nsame-sex marriage. He frames the debate as a conflict between two different views of the \npurpose of marriage\u2014one that understands marriage primarily as a social institution for \nprocreation and childrearing, and another that sees marriage as a bond of love, devotion, and \ncompanionship between two consenting adults. What I appreciate about Sandel\u2019s approach is \nthat he doesn\u2019t simply tell readers which view is \u201ccorrect\u201d; instead, he asks us to wrestle with the \nunderlying moral assumptions that shape each perspective. For me, as someone who supports \nsame-sex marriage, this section was an opportunity to articulate why I believe what I do. I see \nmarriage not just as a private contract but as a public recognition of a shared commitment and a \nlife built together. Denying that recognition to same-sex couples feels inconsistent with the \nprinciples of equality and individual liberty that I hold so strongly. Sandel\u2019s discussion helped me \nrealize that supporting same-sex marriage is not merely a matter of being \u201ctolerant\u201d or accepting \ndiverse lifestyles. It is fundamentally a question of justice\u2014of giving people what they are due \nas equal members of a democratic society. In that way, my libertarian commitment to personal \nfreedom actually deepens my support for marriage equality, because it affirms the right of \nindividuals to define and live out their most meaningful relationships without unnecessary state \ninterference. \nWhat struck me most about Sandel\u2019s work is how he refuses to keep morality locked away in the \nprivate sphere. As someone with libertarian leanings, I often find myself agreeing with the idea \nthat the state should stay neutral on moral questions, letting individuals decide what constitutes \nthe \u201cgood life\u201d for themselves. But Sandel reminds us that this neutrality is, in many ways, \nimpossible. Laws and policies always carry moral weight because they shape whose rights are \nrecognized, whose claims are prioritized, and what we collectively encourage or discourage as \na society. He writes, \u201cSome of our debates reflect disagreement about what it means to \nmaximize welfare or respect freedom or cultivate virtue. Others involve disagreement about \nwhat to do when these ideals conflict. Political philosophy cannot resolve these disagreements \nonce and for all. But it can shape the arguments we have, and bring moral clarity to the \n\nalternatives we confront as democratic citizens\u201d (p. 9). That line really stayed with me because it \nreframed the way I think about civic life. It reminded me that democracy isn\u2019t just about voting \nevery few years and then retreating into private life; it\u2019s about engaging in ongoing, sometimes \nuncomfortable conversations about what justice requires and what we owe to one another. \nSandel seems to be saying that avoiding these debates isn\u2019t neutrality\u2014it\u2019s neglect. Even if we \ncan\u2019t resolve every disagreement, we still have a responsibility to engage with them honestly, to \nlisten to opposing views, and to sharpen our own moral reasoning in the process. For me, this \nwas a powerful challenge to not simply retreat into my ideological corner but to see moral and \npolitical debate as an essential part of living in a pluralistic society. \nSandel\u2019s approach has made me more confident in my own views while also making me \nhumbler about them. I am still very committed to libertarian principles like free speech, bodily \nautonomy, and equality before the law, but I now see more clearly where those principles \nintersect with questions of community and virtue. For example, I still think markets should \ngenerally be free, but I can admit there are situations where unfettered markets might corrode \nimportant social values. I still think people should be able to live as they choose, but I now \nunderstand why communities sometimes want to publicly honor certain ways of life\u2014they see \nthem as tied to human flourishing. \nIn the end, Justice did exactly what Sandel hopes it will do: it pushed me to reason more \ncarefully, to listen more deeply, and to engage in debate with a genuine openness to being \npersuaded. I agree wholeheartedly with Sandel\u2019s main goal of encouraging critical thinking and \npublic reasoning. It\u2019s not about forcing consensus, but about clarifying where we stand and why. \nI now find myself more willing to discuss difficult issues with friends or classmates, not just to \ndefend my beliefs but to understand theirs. Justice, as Sandel frames it, is not a static answer \nbut a living conversation. \nUltimately, I would say this book has made me a better thinker and a more engaged citizen. I \nstill see myself as a libertarian, but I am more aware of the limits of my framework and the ways \nother philosophies can enrich my thinking. I support same-sex marriage, equality before the law, \nand minimal state interference, but I also see the value of reflecting on what kind of society we \nwant to create together, not just what rights we want to protect. Sandel has made me more \nwilling to wrestle with the hard questions, and that, to me, feels like the right thing to do.",

        "text": "Itza Espinosa Porras \nSOC 250- 001 \n9/19/2025 \n \nA reflection of \u201cJustice: What's the Right Thing to Do?\u201d \n \nMichael Sandel is a political philosophy professor at the University of Harvard and \nrenowned author. Sandel\u2019s books cover themes of justice, ethics, democracy, and philosophy. \n\u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d is one of three of Sandel\u2019s books we will be reading \nthis semester. In \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d Sandel depicts real world current \nevents with historical approaches to justice. Sandel provides the examples, to allow the reader to \nexplore some of the biggest political and moral questions, that also tend to be the most \ncontroversial. Throughout the book, the reader is presented with complex ideas, with multiple \nperspectives that allow us to decipher our personal opinion on a topic.  \nThroughout the book we are presented with a couple philosophers: Immanuel Kant, John \nRawls, and Aristotle. Sandel uses their theories and opinions in the book, to connect them with \nrecent issues. In the first couple chapters we are introduced to concepts that work as a framework \nto how we view the rest of the situations in the book. For example, Utilitarianism and \nLibertarianism. Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher, economist, and legal reformer, was the founder \nof modern utilitarianism. The utilitarian philosophy aims to maximize happiness for the largest \nnumber of people possible. Even if it is at the expense of individual rights. John Stuart Mill, one \nof England\u2019s most renowned philosophers and political economists, also believed in \nutilitarianism. His central idea is that people should be allowed to do whatever they want, as long \nas they are not harming others. He believes that actions are morally right if they bring happiness \nto the largest amount of people, yet he refines the theory by also believing that over time, \nrespecting human liberty will lead to the greatest happiness. We are also introduced to \n\nLibertarianism: deference to individual rights. Robert Nozick was an American libertarian \nphilosopher. He believed that individuals have the rights \u201cso strong and far-reaching\u201d that \u201cthey \nraise the question of what, if anything, the state should do.\u201d Nozick rejects the idea of overall \ngood, and a current example of this being the discourse around income equality. Nozick would \nargue that redistribution is unjust. Libertarians love the minimal state. That entails: no \npaternalism, no moral legislation, and no redistribution of wealth. So, I ask myself, is \nmaximizing happiness always the best course of action? I believe it depends on the situation. If \nmost of society is content, without the violation of a minority's human rights then I would agree. \nBut if at the cost of some human rights being violated for the majority's happiness, then I would \nstrongly disagree.  \nWhile covering the first three chapters, in class we discussed the Afghan Goat herders \nsituation, it really resonated with me. In June of 2005, a special forces team set out on a mission \nin Afghanistan in search of a Taliban leader. The Navy SEAL\u2019s were informed that the Taliban \nleader was hiding out in a mountainous region. As they started their trek up the mountain, they \nran into two Afghan goat herders, one of them appearing to be a young boy of around 14 years \nold, both unarmed. The soldiers contemplated their options. They could either kill them or set \nthem free. Without any rope available, they were unable to tie the goat herders to allow time for \nthem to find a new hideout. One soldier argued for them to kill the goat herders. His reasoning \nwas that they were on active duty, they were behind enemy lines, and they had every right to do \neverything to save their own lives. Officer Marcus Luttrell, advocated for the release of the goat \nherders. He casted the deciding vote for the fate of the goat herders. Luttrell explains that his \nfaith and morals would not allow him to kill the unarmed men. An hour or so later after they had \nreleased them, the four soldiers were surrounded by a numerous army of Taliban soldiers. \n\nLuttrell was the only survivor. The Taliban had not only killed the rest of his team, but a nearby \nU.S helicopter who was trying to rescue them, had been shot down, killing all 16 members on \nboard. In retrospect, Luttrell believes he made the wrong decision, as would anyone, if they \nknew how this situation would end. He deeply criticizes his decision to vote for releasing the \ngoat herders. For the reader, it may seem to have been an obvious decision: to kill the goat \nherders. Given that we know the result of the situation, it is hard to disagree with Luttrell that he \nshould\u2019ve killed them. I like how Sandel addresses the uncertainty of the station. Sandel brings \nup multiple perspectives. Although Luttrell anticipated that keeping them alive would be the \nwrong choice, he could not bring himself to kill two human beings in cold blood. We could also \nassume that the goat herders were Taliban sympathizers. If this information had somehow been \nknown beforehand, Luttrell and his squad, I believe, would've had an easier decision to make \nknowing that they are their active enemies. Now suppose they were against the Taliban, and the \nreason they snitched on the Americans was because they were tortured to release intel. If this \ninformation had somehow been known beforehand, I think it would make it harder to kill them in \ncold blood knowing they are on the same side as the Americans. But one could also see it as \nsparing them from being tortured and having their position revealed to the Taliban. I appreciate \nhow Sandel did not automatically assume that the two men were guilty of siding with the \nTaliban. That is definitely a likely possibility, but allowing for the option of them being innocent \nas well and having to unwillingly release information could have also happened. This example in \nthe book really stood out to me. Not only because it was a real life event, but because there\u2019s \nanother level of complexity. As someone who has never had military experience, I could not \nbring myself to kill anyone. Especially in a morally conflicting situation such as this one. But if I \n\ntry to put myself in the situation of a soldier, during an active war, unknowing of who the enemy \nmight be, unfortunately I would vote to kill the two men.  \nIn chapters six through eight, we are introduced to John Rawls. Rawls was an American \npolitical philosopher. He argued that the way we should think about justice is to ask what \nprinciples we would agree to in an initial situation of equality. Rawl\u2019s idea of a social contract is \na hypothetical position of equality. He proposed \u201cThe Veil of Ignorance\u201d. \u201cThe Veil of \nIgnorance\u201d is a unique experiment where people decide on principles of justice for a society \nbefore knowing their own social position, race, physical mobility, economic status, gender, etc. \nRawls believes that by removing that information, people are most likely to agree to a society \nthat protects all members and everyone\u2019s human rights are valued. This creates an impartial \nsociety that disregards self interest. Rawls also believes that society should find ways to reduce \ninequalities. He thinks jobs, opportunity, and education should be available to everyone. Which I \nagree with. Rawls' difference principle states that inequalities are only allowed if they benefit \nthose with the least advantages in society. A real world example of this is a progressive tax \nsystem. With this tax system, those with higher pay will pay a greater amount from their income \ntaxes. And these taxes can be used to fund systems such as public school, healthcare, affordable \nhousing, food assistance, and other programs that people in the lower income bracket can use. \nAccording to Rawls\u2019s difference principle, inequality would still exist. But, with a fraction of the \nwealth these high income individuals are making, it is moral to redistribute the wealth and it \nbenefits the least advantaged.  \nAnother topic that stood out to me is in Chapter 7, \u201cArguing Affirmative Action\u201d. As a \nstudent of color in a predominantly white institution, I strongly support affirmative action. \nSandel provides a couple reasons for the argument of supporting affirmative action. They correct \n\ntest gaps in standardized testing. From personal experience, I came from a very predominantly \nwhite high school but it was also wealthy. Therefore, I was privileged to learn from my teachers, \nother faculty, and classmates, what steps I needed to take to get into college. Coming from a first \ngeneration perspective, I was grateful to have the resources I had in school. I cannot even begin \nto imagine a student's perspective from an underfunded, maybe rural, school. Having parents that \nguide you through the college process, and fund your ability to take the ACT/SAT as many times \nas you want is an immense privilege. Another big reason I support affirmative action is that it \npromotes diversity. If a university wants a preferred demographic to attend their university, that \nis their personal goal. Throughout history, people of color have been limited to higher education. \nTherefore, I think a university should be allowed to accept a demographic based on their \npersonal preferences as an institution.  \nOverall, I enjoyed reading Sandel\u2019s \u201cJustice: What's the Right Thing to Do?\u201d. Sandel \ntouches on topics that involve my life, but I rarely think about. I have been applying these \ntheories and perspectives to current events that are happening. I have become more open minded. \nI am really looking forward to reading his other two books.",

        "text": "Veronica Bretzius \nDr. Douglas J. Engelman \nSOC-250-001 \nUniversity of North Carolina Wilmington \nSeptember 19, 2025 \nUnderstanding Justice and Morality \n\u200b\nJustice is a concept that opens the door for ongoing debate about what actions can be \nconsidered wrong and what actions can be considered right. Very often in society, individuals are \nfaced with moral dilemmas that may directly challenge their personal values, sometimes \nresulting in harm being caused to another person or to something else of value. Michael J. Sandel \nengages with this topic in depth in his book Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?. Sandel is not \nonly a political philosopher but also a best-selling author and a professor at Harvard University. \nHis main focus in teaching centers on the themes of justice, morality, and what can be \ndetermined to be in the best interest of the common good. Throughout this book, Sandel provides \na variety of real-world examples as well as carefully constructed hypothetical scenarios that \nforce the reader to pause and think seriously about what decision they would make if they were \ncaught in the middle of a difficult moral dilemma. Would you personally be able to make the \nright decision? The answers will almost always vary from person to person because of the larger \nunderlying question, which is: What truly counts as the right decision? \nIn the opening chapter of the text, Sandel raises the famous question of what an \nindividual would choose to do if they were placed in the middle of the so-called Trolley Problem. \nMost people might respond by saying they would save the five individuals on the main track and \nsacrifice only one person on the side track, while others would argue that interfering at all is not \n\nthe morally correct action to take. Personally, I have never been comfortable with this question \nand often choose not to answer it, because if I were the person with control of the lever, I \nimagine I would be desperately searching for another possible way to stop the train altogether. I \nhave come to realize that, in a sense, I may have been subconsciously avoiding the harder task of \nthinking deeply about this issue. When I read this chapter and later discussed it with my \nclassmates, I found myself mentally exhausted and even upset that there was no single correct \nanswer. Being caught in the middle of a situation like this forces us to confront and reconsider \nthe very meaning of justice itself. \nTwo important terms appear frequently in the first few chapters of the book: \nlibertarianism and utilitarianism. Libertarianism places its focus on protecting individual rights \nas well as personal freedoms, whereas utilitarianism aims to promote the greatest happiness by \nsupporting the common good of society. Predicaments involving these two contrasting \nperspectives emphasize how the idea of \u201cwhat is just\u201d can vary greatly depending on the \nviewpoint of each person. A common example in which these concepts are especially relevant is \nthe issue of the wage gap in the United States. A utilitarian would likely argue that redistributing \nwealth through higher taxes on the wealthy would ultimately help more people than it would \nhurt. They might also claim that individuals being taxed at higher rates would be able to recover \nfinancially, while lower-income families would gain more stability in adjusting to the economy. \nA libertarian, on the other hand, would strongly disagree and maintain that billionaires in the \nUnited States should not have their hard-earned money taken away through redistribution. Once \nagain, the question of what is truly just presents itself in this kind of situation. An ideal solution \nto this problem would involve factoring in public opinion and considering where the majority of \n\nsociety stands. Placing emphasis on protecting the common good begins with having a genuine \ndesire to promote what is best for the community as a whole. \nI was raised in a large family as the youngest daughter of four. I learned throughout my \nchildhood the importance of protecting the well-being of the greater good and considering the \ncontext in a disagreement. I also discovered individualism and how, in some cases, bringing joy \nto the majority is not fair if it brings harm to an individual. Once, when my family and I went \ncross-country when I was about ten years old, I really wanted to go to the Mall of America. It \nwas the one thing I had asked for on this trip, so I was very upset when my parents told me it was \ntoo far off our route. I remember wanting to start a fight but realizing how annoyed my sisters \nwould be if we got home any later than we were. I considered how everyone had to sacrifice \nsomething for this trip and put aside my personal interest to keep the majority happy. Another \nsituation from my childhood I can remember where I stood up for myself in a disagreement was \nwhile playing our Nintendo Wii. I was maybe seven years old when my sisters and I were \ngoofing off and broke a centerpiece in our living room. They all agreed to blame me because I \nwas the youngest and would get into the least amount of trouble, but I argued that it was a group \neffort, and I should not have to throw myself under the bus to protect everyone else involved. I \ncan\u2019t remember what happened from there, but I do know that this memory shaped my idea of \nindividualism. I feel as if events like this from my childhood helped shape my morals and \nunderstanding of contextual significance. When discussing moral dilemmas in school \nenvironments, I try to carry these traits with me. It is important to consider morals, context, and \noutcomes when making decisions to protect the greater good or one\u2019s individual rights. \nMy understanding and efforts to consider circumstantial value differ from some ideas of \nImmanuel Kant. I usually act on things with reference to the situational context, whereas Sandel \n\ndescribes in the text that Kant says you must tell the truth in every situation and that the \noutcomes do not matter if you acted in a way that was morally correct. I disagree with this take \nspecifically, and I feel that if you are lying to protect someone or something, it can be okay, \nconsidering the context. Kant emphasizes the idea of duty and universal law and how we should \nignore consequences to protect morality. I can see more of where he was coming from with this \nassertion, and I do believe it is important to contribute to your society and keep the best interest \nof others as well as yourself. \nMy first interactions with true morality began in elementary school. I was raised in a \nCatholic home and attended Catholic school my whole life. I learned a lot about ideas of good \nvs. evil and how to properly treat others. While there are some notable flaws and controversy, I \nreally admire the Catholic Church, specifically its structure and services. I learned general moral \nprinciples and virtues while also understanding privilege, injustices, and how I can personally \ngive back to my community. That being said, my personal experiences and learning will not \nalign with everyone in the country or even some Catholics themselves. I have always found it \nimportant to remember this when understanding others\u2019 political beliefs, actions, or ways of life. \nIn class, when we touched on the topic of morality in the justice system, I felt strongly \nopinionated on this. Most Americans uphold different morals and virtues on a microscopic level, \nbut there is so much overlap in overall beliefs that needs to be considered. After taking ethics, \nyoga, and many theology courses over the years, I have connected countless trends within the \nreligions I studied. The disagreements about morals in the justice system are not persisting \nbecause people have drastically different moral opinions, but they are rooted in the desire to help \ntheir community and the greater good. \n\nThe last few chapters of the text discuss philosophical concepts from John Rawls and \nAristotle. Sandel writes about how Rawls believed equality is about fairness and not utility or \nmerit. Rawls' idea is similar to the contrast of equality vs. equity. Sandel uses his ideas when \ndiscussing the Grutter v. Bollinger Supreme Court case. He claims that universities should not \ngrant acceptance based on merit or utility, but rather how well that person would fit in and \nuphold the campus motto. These ideas are similar to the ones from Aristotle that Sandel \nconnects. Aristotle preached his theory of justice, which was that everyone should be given what \nthey deserve based on purpose or \u201ctelos.\u201d I think this is really important to focus on when \ndiscussing affirmative action. In a situation where two students have the same qualifications but \nonly one will be let into a university, the acceptance should be awarded to the person who will \nbest fulfill the purpose of the university. My personal opinion on this is that universities should \ntake into account the disadvantages that students may have had that could have limited their \nacademic success, but they endured and achieved high levels. Both the philosophers and Sandel \nshowed me a more detailed interpretation of equality and affirmative action, and what factors \nshould be considered when dealing with the two. \nAfter reading this novel and gaining insight into what my classmates believe, I feel much \nmore confident in my understanding of justice, morality, and welfare. I was able to unpack \nreal-world moral dilemmas and conflicts while also connecting teachings with present-day or \npersonal issues. At times, while reading this novel, I became frustrated or confused, but I am \npleased with the fact that I had to stop and think about the material. Sandel\u2019s mention of \nphilosophers like Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, and Aristotle sheds light on the fact that ethical \nopinions have been around for centuries, which brings hope to me that our country\u2019s injustices \ncan be dealt with.",

        "text": "Sociology of the Family Midterm Review Paper  \nAs we know, norms shift and change throughout time periods and cultures. This applies \nto social institutions as we know them, even ones that seem cemented by tradition. Marriage, as \nwe have discussed at length in this class, shifts in its meanings and norms as an institution. Even \nthe family structure, with its gender ideals and typical iterations has looked different across \ndecades, countries, and racial and ethnic groups. Traditionalists fight for a nuclear family \nstructure, while more liberal ideologies assert that family units do not have to look a certain way \nin order to be healthy and nurturing. Kin relationships, step-families, queer couples, and \npolyamorous relationships all stray from the traditional ideas of family structure. Even \ndifferences in having children, like IVF, surrogacy, and adoption are outside of what would be \nconsidered a \u201cnormal\u201d family structure. But what purpose does marriage serve, and how will it \ncontinue to shift and change in the coming years?  \n\u200b\nAll social institutions serve purposes within our societal structure. Marriage is not merely \na symbol of love, devotion, and partnership, but also an economic and practical decision to \nconjoin finances and households. Historically, marriage has served different purposes across time \nperiods and geographic areas. In some cultures, marriage is pre-arranged, leaving individuals \nwith no choice in who they will be tied to forever. In past times, marriage was extremely \npolitical, with families choosing lifelong partners for their children based on furthering their \nwealth or status. Debates have long existed about what counts as a \u2018proper\u2019 marriage, even in the \nU.S. With the passing of the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022, and the decision of the Supreme \nCourt in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, both same-sex marriage and interracial marriage are now \ncompletely legalized in America.  \n\n\u200b\nIn addition to the changing legal definitions and practical purposes of marriage, there \nhave also been changes in how and when people get married. As discussed in class, cohabitation \nbefore, or instead of, marriage has become increasingly more common in the last several years. \nFurthermore, while marriage is still desirable for younger generations, many are waiting until \nthey are much older to marry and start families. Additionally, the divorce rate now sits at around \n50%. If half of all marriages end in divorce, why is marriage still a desirable marker of social \nstatus?  \n\u200b\nWhile it is impossible to know what the future holds, past trends can assist us in \npredicting future ones. I predict that family structures will continue to evolve further and further \nfrom the idealization of the traditional, nuclear family. I predict that cohabitation will become \neven more popularized and normalized in society. Though marriage is still an ideal for many \nyounger individuals, it is no longer seen as a necessity. With the increased percentage of women \nin education and in the workforce, marriage is no longer a necessary economic proposition for a \nwoman. This is what is known as the \u201cquiet revolution,\u201d and is a direct result of second wave \nfeminism. (Lundberg and Pollack, 2015) Additionally, I predict that the birth rate will decrease \nover the next 10 years. I know of many women my age who do not want to have children, for a \nmultitude of different reasons.  \n\u200b\nThis is not to say that the traditional nuclear family structure will disappear altogether. In \nfact, I think that this will always be seen as an American ideal. Many American Christian\u2019s hold \nonto this idea of a traditional family as the \u2018correct\u2019 way, some going as far as condemning \ndivorce, gay marriage, and polyamory. As with any push towards modern ideals, the pendulum \nwill swing for a counteraction of conservative traditional ideas. Besides the religious push for \ntraditionalism, there is nothing wrong about a traditional, nuclear structure of family. In my \n\nopinion, more modern ideals are not anti-traditional, rather, they are about becoming more \naccepting of more diverse versions of family structures.  \n\u200b\nI also predict that the divorce rate will continue to stay high, but eventually will lessen. \nWith women becoming more financially independent, it is less necessary for them to be married. \nWomen no longer have to stay in unhappy relationships just because they rely on a man for their \neconomic wellbeing. Eventually though, I think the divorce rate will plateau and lessen. I think \npeople waiting until they are older to marry, and women being more firm in their expectations of \nwhat a man will bring to the table, will eventually lessen the rate of divorce. It is less common \nnow to \u2018settle\u2019 for a man, because women can be financially independent.  \n\u200b\nConversely, I think that unmarried birth rates will continue to rise. Many people are \nchoosing to cohabitate now without getting married. I think that this will continue to be a pattern, \nand that many people will choose to have children in this kind of relationship rather than getting \nlegally married. 50 years ago, cohabitating without being married was seen as extremely taboo. \nNow, we are seeing it become more and more normalized. I think this will only rise in popularity \nand that the birth rate outside of marriage will continue to increase over the next ten years. In \nEurope, this is already the norm as many choose to cohabitate for life instead of marrying at all. \n(Lundberg and Pollack, 2015)  \n\u200b\nAs for gender roles in relation to marriage, I think these are shifting as well. Traditionally, \nthe man of the house is the breadwinner. He goes to work and provides financially for the family. \nThe woman, whether she works outside of the household or not, is responsible for most of the \ncaretaking and household tasks. She cooks, cleans, and takes care of the children. When she \nworks a job outside of the household as well, the housework becomes her \u2018second shift\u2019. As \nwe\u2019ve talked about in class, we are seeing a rise in stay-at-home dads, and of fathers assuming \n\nsome of the household roles and tasks. I think (and hope) that it is becoming more normal for \nfathers to help out around the house, and to be more involved in caring for the children.  \n\u200b\nIdeally, by 2035, policy will reflect the modernization being experienced by individuals \nin America. For one, hopefully a mandatory paid parental leave will be instituted nationwide. For \nanother, quality childcare should be more affordable, especially for families in which both \nparents need to work in order to live. Hopefully, there will be no policy changes that threaten the \nlegality of same-sex and interracial marriage. Ideally, this would become a Constitutional right, \nand not something that could be threatened by particular presidential administrations.  \n\u200b\nIn conclusion, family structures may not change drastically in the next 10 years. Rather, \nwhat we may see is more of a normalization of familial trends that we already see in 2025. \nSame-sex marriage, blended families, kinship networks, and other non-traditional forms of \nfamily structures will become more and more regular. I predict that divorce rates will lessen, \nhowever, unmarried birth rates will continue to rise. Social institutions are important in society \nbut it is necessary that they change with us. Stagnant norms do not give rise to growth and \nchange. Norms have shifted and changed drastically over the last 50 years and I predict that they \nwill only continue to do so in the future.  \n \nWorks Cited  \nLundberg, S., & Pollak, R. A. (2015).

        "text": "Alexander Svab \nA Boy Broken Reflection \nThe memoir, A Boy Broken, written by Dr. Douglas Engelman provides a comprehensive \nunderstanding into his complex relationship with his late son Doug. Doug struggled with \nschizophrenia for the majority of his adult life and faced the many ups and downs that come with \nhaving a psychotic disorder. While I do not personally have experience with a psychotic disorder, \nI have lived with an eating disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, \nand anxiety for nearly a decade. Getting treatment for my mental disorders has been life \nchanging, but it is still a constant struggle to stay on top of everything. This memoir provides \ninsight to topics that are often seen within those experiencing a mental disorder such as social \nisolation, genetics, and family relationships while also providing more insight into the world of \nmental disorders. \nSocial isolation can be seen from those experiencing a mental disorder. Often there is \nstigma surrounding these individuals as the public generally sees those suffering from a mental \ndisorder as weak, scary, dangerous, etc. Schizophrenia is one of the most misunderstood mental \nillnesses as it is often depicted as unsafe by the media leading people to have misconceptions as \nto what it means to be schizophrenic. This may be one of the reasons these individuals are often \nseen isolated from their peers and family. Doug experienced varying degrees of isolation from \nhis peers and family at the start of his first psychotic break and this pattern continued throughout \nthe rest of his life. His isolation was likely due to hallucinations, and the paranoia that \naccompany those who are schizophrenic. However, there was a probability his isolation was due \nto subconscious fears of people thinking he was crazy or broken when in reality he was \nexperiencing something out of his control.  \n\nLike Doug, I have experienced levels of social isolation throughout my life due to my \nmental health. Social isolation and withdrawal is a common symptom of depression which is \nsomething I have been clinically diagnosed with for ten years. When I notice my depression \ngetting worse, I tend to find myself slow to respond to text messages, cancelling plans often, and \nunable to leave my house. This is challenging in today's world, but I have learned coping skills to \nhelp with the debilitating symptoms that depression can carry.  \nAnother topic that is touched on in this memoir is genetics and its strong connection to \nthose struggling with mental illness. Most mental disorders have some connection to genetics. \nPsychotic disorders are caused by having a genetic predisposition to various genes that trigger \nsymptoms of mental disorders. Doug\u2019s great uncle Harry was diagnosed with schizophrenia \nwhen he was in his twenties. This genetic predisposition is likely a large contributor to Doug\u2019s \nschizophrenia as well as the trauma associated with his parent\u2019s divorce. \nMost of my mental health struggles have a strong link to genetics as a lot of my mother\u2019s \nfamily experiences similar mental illnesses to me. Both of my parents as well as my brother and \nsister struggle with an eating disorder, but I am the only one actively seeking help for it. This is \nchallenging to navigate as I do not like to watch people I love and care about struggle with a \ndisease I know all too well. Additionally, my maternal grandmother struggles with severe \ndepression leading me to have genes that trigger depression symptoms due to the struggles I have \ngoing on in my life. OCD also has a genetic component to it, but there is no one in my family \nofficially diagnosed with it. That being said, it is something I struggle with immensely which \nleads me to believe it developed primarily as a way to gain control. OCD is commonly \nmisdiagnosed as a generalized anxiety disorder, so some of my family members may have it, and \njust not know. For me, being transgender in a world that does not accept me for who I am has \n\ncaused immense distress and led me to seek out many unhealthy coping skills such as my eating \ndisorder, and OCD. My anxiety and depression can also be largely attributed to this as they are \ncommon co-occurring disorders.  \nFamily relationships are another important part of this memoir as it is spoken to \nfrequently throughout the book. Often family members feel as though they must \u201cfix\u201d the \nindividual dealing with mental illness even though that is not possible. This often manifests by \nfamily members becoming care givers for their loved ones. In the memoir, Douglas speaks of \ncaring for Doug as he struggled with his mental health. He held on to his money for Doug as he \nwas unable to responsibly use it. This was a system that seemed to work well for them overall. \nDouglas also found himself arranging Doug\u2019s therapist and psychiatric appointments as well as \nensuring he attended them. Additionally, he is the one who initially helped Doug find a place to \nreceive care after his first psychotic break. This created a lot of challenges for Douglas and I can \nonly imagine how challenging it is to watch a loved one struggle while not being able to solve all \ntheir problems. Not only did Douglas help him, but his sister, Melissa, and his mother, Bobbie, \nalso supported him at various points of his life. Due to the two\u2019s personal struggles and life \nexperiences, they were unable to caretake for Doug for long and Douglas was sent to step back \nin.   \nDoug was fortunate and had an extremely supportive system set up, however, not all \nindividuals struggling with mental disorders have this support. Some people are left to find their \nown resources and navigate the challenging experience of finding care on their own. Other \nindividuals are left with no health insurance or means to afford mental health care which creates \na challenging situation and is why a large majority of the unhoused population struggles with a \nvariety of untreated mental disorders. Even if one has health insurance, it can still be challenging \n\nto find a place nearby with licensed mental health professionals that have the specific training \nrequired to treat the issues at hand especially in more rural areas.  \nWhile reading this memoir, I found myself reflecting on my experience with my family \nand how they perceive my own mental health struggles. When I was initially diagnosed with \nanorexia, my parents did not seem to believe it was real or that I needed help even though my \ntherapist at the time recommended a higher level of care for treatment. As I got older, I continued \nto struggle with my eating disorder. When I came home from Appalachian State University for \nthe summer, I entered an intensive outpatient program (IOP) to have extra support with both my \neating disorder and relationship with my parents as they were not very supportive of my gender \nidentity. Eventually, I was fortunate enough to have a team of providers who cared about me \nenough to refer me to a residential treatment program where I found myself living for eight \nmonths. The center was in Alabama as it is one of the only places in the United States that is well \ntrained in eating disorders within the transgender population. Most eating disorder facilities are \nonly for women which made it challenging for me to find the right treatment center. While in \ntreatment, my mother became receptive to the idea that I did in fact need help for my anorexia \nand began asking for ways to support me. On the other hand, my father was extremely \ntransphobic and unreceptive to anything therapists were telling him, so we decided to solely \nfocus on my relationship with my mom. She became my sole caregiver from a distance. Once I \nwas done with treatment and able to come back home, we created ways that she could support \nme and ensure I was eating properly to maintain recovery. She also became more supportive of \nmy gender identity and while she still has some struggles with it, she has grown a lot. \nNow that I am stable in recovery and moved out of my house, she has found new ways to \ncontinue her role as a caregiver without it being as draining for her. We work together on meal \n\npreparation as well as grocery shopping. She is there when I need her to be. I have a lot more \nindependence now that my body can keep up with me and my mom is not as worried about me \nall the time. Sometimes, it can feel like one is a burden when they rely on someone to care for \nthem, but I always have to remind myself that they would not be helping me if they did not love \nme. \nWhile I was in a partial hospitalization program (PHP) for anorexia, I attempted suicide \nwhich caused me to end up in a psychiatric ward. My experience there was very bizarre as I met \na wide variety of people and was met with rules and regulations that largely did not make sense \nto me. In the psychiatric ward, I called my mother and she seemed to react similarly to Douglas \nwhen he spoke with Doug in a similar situation. My mom had the reaction of not exactly \nknowing anything about these places and also expressing relief that I was going back to \nresidential treatment with some of the best mental health professionals I have ever met. Douglas \nseemed to react similarly with Doug when they spoke for the first time after Doug began his \ntreatment journey. Like Doug, I also do not exactly remember my time in the psychiatric ward \nand have a very hard time discussing that week of my life. I hope I can get to a place one day \nwhere I am able to talk about it. \nOverall, the themes of social isolation, genetics, and family connections are very apparent \nthroughout this memoir as well as the impact that mental disorders have on one\u2019s everyday life. \nThe impact may be due to one experiencing symptoms, but it also tends to be seen through loved \nones experiencing something challenging and wanting to help them. While this memoir was \nheartbreaking at times, I enjoyed reading it and gathering more insight into the world of \nschizophrenia. Reading this has helped me feel more connected to the course content, and I am \nglad I got to do so.",

        "text": "Blake 1 \nKeira Blake  \nDr. Douglas Engelman \nSOC-250-001 \n19 September 2025  \nWhat is Justice?  \nThe author of \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d is an American political \nphilosopher and professor at Harvard University named Michael Joseph Sandel. This book is a \nNew York Times bestseller that explores political philosophy and moral dilemmas by applying \ntheoretical and analytical thinking to real-world issues. Sandel invites the readers to engage in \nreasoned debate about justice and the common good in society. He challenges the shallowness of \ndebates focused solely on personal gain or individual liberty, arguing for a third basis: the impact \non the common good. In \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d, it focuses on and examines \ndifferent philosophical approaches to justice, including those of Aristotle, Kant, Mill, and Rawls, \nto understand contrasting ideas. While engaging with complex philosophy, the book is written in \na lively and accessible way, making it suitable for a broad audience interested in making sense of \npolitics, morality, and their own beliefs.  \nChapter 1, \u201cDoing the Right Thing,\u201d of \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d talks \nabout the central question of justice: how should we decide what\u2019s right? He uses real-world \nproblems and dilemmas to depict this, for example, his trolley problem, Hurricane Charley, or \nthe Afghan goatherds. He uses these examples to show three main approaches to justice: \nmaximizing welfare (utilitarianism), respecting freedom (libertarianism), and promoting \nvirtue/common good (Aristotelian traditions). The runaway trolley dilemma proposes the \nquestion of saving one life or saving five when the solution is in hand. The brakes on the trolley \n\nBlake 2 \nstop working, and there are two groups on the track. You can pull the lever and move the trolley \nto the right, killing one worker and sparing five. A little bit later into the story it proposes another \nquestion: if you are just watching from a distance and see a bigger man standing there, you could \npush him onto the tracks and avert this disaster. In my opinion, I would not push this man onto \nthe tracks, knowing in doing this I just killed him and put myself into a bigger situation. I would \njust let the train go, knowing I could not do anything aligning with my morals. It would be on my \nguilty conscience that I just killed this man when I could have removed myself from the situation \nand not done anything. Obviously this is a hard and terrible situation, knowing you could have \npeople but at the loss of others.  \nIn chapter 2, \u201cThe Greatest Happiness Principle/Utilitarianism,\u201d it speaks about \nutilitarianism, defining justice as maximizing overall happiness or pleasure. Sandel explores \nstrengths like simplicity and impartiality and weaknesses like knowing utilitarianism can justify \nsacrificing individuals, ignores rights, and undervalues higher ideals. Like, for example, the \nlifeboat story when there were four stranded sailors, and when the cabin boy got sick, the group \nkilled and ate him. They claimed they did this out of necessity to survive and promote the \ngeneral well-being of keeping the majority alive. Bentham, an English moral philosopher, \nfounded the doctrine of utilitarianism to maximize happiness. Mill contradicts this idea, thinking \nrefinement emphasizes quality of pleasures and liberty as essential to well-being. Chapter 3, \u201cDo \nWe Own Ourselves?/Libertarianism,\u201d goes hand in hand with this. Libertarianism holds that \nindividuals own themselves and their labor, so government oversight should be \nminimal\u2014protecting life, property, and contracts. Sandel examines issues in the book like \ntaxation as it is seen as forced labor, drug laws, and military conscription. For libertarianism, \ntaxation is seen as forced labor because \u201cif you are taxed, you can always choose to work less \n\nBlake 3 \nand pay lower taxes; but if you are forced to labor, you have no such choice.\u201d Basically saying \nthat people are forced to pay the government money, and it should be voluntary; if they wanted \nto pay and help the community, they would. The tension arises between absolute self-ownership \nand the social responsibilities that come with living in a community. Personally, it's hard for me \nto lean one way completely because in certain situations I could agree with either. I do think that \ntaxes should be something everyone has to pay and should not be voluntary because it helps the \nmajority, but I also don\u2019t think some people should be sacrificed unwillingly to help the majority. \nChapter 4, \u201cHired Help / Markets and Morals,\u201d asks whether everything should be up for \nsale. Sandel considers markets in controversial areas like military service substitutes, surrogate \nmotherhood, and organ sales. He argues markets aren\u2019t neutral: they can corrupt or degrade the \nvalue of certain goods and can create inequality by allowing the wealthy to \u201cbuy\u201d advantages. \nOne story that gets brought up to demonstrate this is \u201cPregnancy for Pay,\u201d which is about a \nfamily paying a surrogate to have their baby since they can\u2019t. It comes up with the question of if \nthey are paying for the baby itself, which is baby-selling, or paying for the service of having the \nbaby. Mary-Beth is the surrogate for the Sterns, and eventually when she has the baby for them, \nshe tries to take it, but they go to court and fight for custody of the child. The baby ultimately \nwent to the Stern family for the child's sake. In my opinion, I think they were paying Mary Beth \nfor the service of having the child and the burden of carrying it to term for them, not for the baby \nitself. Also, I think it is a good idea that the child ended up in the custody of the Sterns because \nthey had a contract set and paid Mary Beth; not only that, but she tried to flee with the child.  \n\u201cWhat Matters Is the Motive/Immanuel Kant\u201d is the name of chapter 5, and it focuses on \nhow Kant shifts focus from consequences to motives. Thinking that the only truly moral actions \nare those done from duty, guided by reason, and acting only on principles you would have as \n\nBlake 4 \nuniversal laws, treat people as ends, not means. Justice, in Kant\u2019s eyes, requires respecting \nhuman dignity, not maximizing welfare or efficiency. He believes that actions represented as \ngood in themselves are necessary: \u201cKant contrasts hypothetical imperatives, which are always \nconditional, with a kind of imperative that is unconditional: a categorical imperative\u201d (pg. 112). I \ndon't fully believe in Kant's ideas; for example, if an axe murderer was coming after my friend, I \nwould lie about where they were. I would want my friend to survive, and I would not want to be \nthe reason they got found and killed. There are reasons to lie sometimes, which Kant doesn\u2019t \nbelieve. In Chapter 6, \u201cThe Case for Equality / John Rawls,\u201d Rawls argues that justice is fairness. \nUsing the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d thought experiment, he claims people would choose two \nprinciples: equal basic liberties for all, and inequalities are just only if they benefit the least \nadvantaged, involving social and economic equality. Kant and Rawls agree on the importance of \nuniversal principles, autonomy, and justice over consequences. Rawls ideas challenge \nlibertarianism and utilitarianism by emphasizing fairness over luck or efficiency. \nIn Chapter 7, \u201cArguing Affirmative Action,\u201d Sandel examines debates over affirmative \naction in college admissions. He outlines three justifications: correcting past injustice, promoting \ndiversity, and promoting meritocracy. Critics argue it violates fairness or demeans achievement. \nFor example, the Hopwood study is based on Cheryl Hopwood, a white applicant who was \ndenied admission to the University of Texas Law School despite strong academic credentials. \nShe argued that the school\u2019s affirmative action policy discriminated against her, since minority \napplicants with lower grades and test scores were admitted. In my opinion, I think there are many \ndifferent things that go into college applications that could be bigger than test scores and \nacademics. Like their essay, extracurriculars, athletics, etc. Even if they were even on that \nstandpoint and just differed in academics, I think the school is still entitled to choose who they \n\nBlake 5 \nwant if they want to include more diversity. She did not have to go to this college, and college is \na choice and privilege for many people. The discussion highlights deeper questions: what counts \nas merit, and should admissions reflect individual achievement or social purposes? \nIn chapter 8, \u201cWho Deserves What?/Aristotle,\u201d it kind of goes along with chapter 7, \nsaying that Aristotle sees justice as giving people what they deserve, but this depends on the \npurpose or telos of the good being distributed. For example, the purpose of a university is \ncultivating knowledge, not rewarding legacy or wealth. Justice thus requires reasoning about \nvirtue and the common good, not just neutral principles. In the book, they talk about the story of \nCallie Smartt, a high school freshman with cerebral palsy. She was a cheerleader during the \nfootball season, but at the end she got kicked off for not being able to perform the gymnastics \nand tumbling required to be on the team. \u201cCallie\u2019s story raises two questions. One is a question \nof fairness. Should she be required to do gymnastics in order to qualify as a cheerleader, or is this \nrequirement unfair, given her disability?\u201d (pg. 149). My response to this question would be that \nit's not fair to kick her off the team when she has an abundant amount of school spirit and shows \nher worth of staying on the team. Just because she cannot do flips or tricks, she can still cheer the \nteam on while her other cheerleading teammates fulfill the requirements.  \nChapter 9, \u201cWhat Do We Owe One Another?/Dilemmas of Loyalty,\u201d explores moral \nduties rooted in ties of loyalty, community, and identity, such as family, country, or religion. \nSandel contrasts universal moral principles with particular obligations, for example, patriotism \nand solidarity. He raises the question: are we only bound by impartial and unbiased principles, or \nalso by the \u201cmoral weight\u201d of our personal attachments? Part of this chapter asks the question of \nif the government and people should apologize for the sins and wrongdoings of our predecessors. \nEven if we did not personally harm those, and it was the previous generations, we should still \n\nBlake 6 \nacknowledge and apologize for it. For example, slavery\u2014although slavery is not a thing \nanymore, racism still exists, and we can acknowledge that so that history does not repeat itself. \nFinally, the last chapter, \u201cJustice and the Common Good,\u201d argues that justice cannot be morally \nneutral. Decisions about justice inevitably involve debates about virtue, purpose, and the \ncommon good. Sandel critiques liberal neutrality, like Rawls and libertarianism, and concludes \nthat a just society must engage in moral and civic dialogue about what kind of people and \ncommunity we want to be. This chapter brings up one point about justice and the common good, \ntalking about how John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama had very opposing ideas about religion in \npolitics. John F. Kennedy felt that even though he was Catholic, he was not going to base any of \nhis ideas or concepts on religion, knowing people would disagree. On the other hand, Obama \nthought that his Christianity should be involved in his politics, since the majority of America \nwould be influenced and believe the same as him. Personally, I think religion has no place in the \ngovernment or politics, especially in America, knowing that we have such a diverse country and \nnot everyone believes in religion or the same religion at all. I do understand where Obama was \ncoming from, though, because both he and JFK were doing what would get them the most votes. \nIn the end, \u201cJustice: What Is the Right Thing to Do?\u201d pushes readers to wrestle with \ndifficult questions about morality, fairness, and the common good. By exploring contrasting \nphilosophies and applying them to real-world dilemmas, Sandel shows that justice is never \nsimple and cannot be reduced to one principle alone. Instead, it requires thoughtful reflection, \nopen debate, and a willingness to balance personal freedom with responsibility to others. His \nwork ultimately challenges us not only to think critically about what is right but also to consider \nthe kind of society we want to build together.",

Our country \nstarted with a \u201ctraditional\u201d family structure in every home, consisting of a mother, a father, and \nabout two children. Now, we are seeing a decline in marriage, an increase in blended families \nwith single parents, a rise of women and mothers in the workforce, and a larger acceptance of \nLGBTQ families. Along with these increases and adjustments that are being seen, there is also a \nsort of shift towards egalitarian relationships and marriage, which seems to possibly increase in \nthe future. All of these sorts of adjustments and shifts that we have seen within the past couple \ndecades leads me to believe that by 2035, the American family will be more socially inclusive, \nwith higher equity in labor, childcare, and structure, within a marriage or relationship. \nAdditionally, I believe that marriage rates and birth rates will continue to decline and egalitarian \nrelationships will continue to grow and develop in the future, and a more sense of equality and \nequity between individuals in a relationship will emerge.  \nFrom the beginning, the idea of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d drove individuals to chase such a \ntraditional and conventional family life. It is understood that families are \u201csocial institutions that \nperform vital functions for their members and societies\u2026\u201d such as producing, nurturing, and \nsocializing their children, caring for elderly family members, providing laborers for the \neconomy, and meeting emotional needs for their family members (Hill, 2012). To be considered \na social institution it is assumed that there are a set of roles that need to be filled. The traditional \nstyle family emerged from this sort of assumption for responsibilities, which was required to \nsustain this definition of general family life. In traditional marriages, \u201cthe most universal feature \nof marriage has been division of labor between men and women\u201d (Hill, 2012). The division of \nlabor sets the woman to be at home with household labor, while the man is head of economic \ndecisions and outside labor. Historically, it is argued that \u201cThe fact that only women can give \n\n3 \nbirth to and breastfeed children makes them the logical caregivers for children and is at the root \nof the gender division of family labor\u201d (Hill, 2012). This fact led to the assumption and assigning \nof gender roles as early as the hunting and gathering societies. The gender ideology that led \ntraditional families and marriages was the one that pointed to \u201cmen were the dominant partner in \nthe marriage or the heads of their families, and wives were subservient and obedient to their \nhusbands\u201d (Hill, 2012). Ultimately, this assumption and assigning of roles were the guidelines \nfor a traditional marriage and family, and led our country\u2019s relationships for decades.  \nThe traditional family structure was the key to success for families in the US for years. \nDuring the 1970s, the feminist shift led to an adjustment of this traditional ideology of marriage. \nWomen entered the workforce and were allowed to pursue careers. This shift allowed women to \nrealize that they do not necessarily have to get married at a young age since they can make \nmoney for themselves and not start a family immediately. Women slowly began to realize that \nthey are \u201cindependent and [became] reluctant to get involved in marriage and pregnancy\u201d (Liang, \n2024). The feminist theory that really took off in the 70s supported this theme of women taking a \nstep back from young marriages and family development. The feminist theory and perspective \nreflects many different principles, but the ones that are most important are the \u201cequal rights for \nwomen\u201d ideology and the \"theory of a woman\u2019s point of view and her experience\u201d (Finn & \nBrown, 2022). When women began developing a stronger sense of self and individuality, they \nalso began delaying marriage and starting a family to focus on themselves and their own \nsuccesses. This included going to school and obtaining a higher education level degree, \ndivorcing their husbands, and partaking in contraception to prevent starting a family at a young \nage. The development of allowing women into the workforce had an impact on the role that a \nwoman plays in a family and also altered marriage rates and birth rates. This sense of self and \n\n4 \nindividual worth by the woman also allowed for communication towards desires of an egalitarian \nrelationship. Becoming equal in the workforce was the beginning for women to push for equality \nin a relationship and in a family structure.  \nWhen identifying the shift of equality that women began to experience and comparing it \nto how a traditional family and role of a mother were seen in the past, it allows sociologists to \nidentify differences and future changes that may occur within an American family structure. \nWhen I look at the broad, general data, I can see an obvious difference between family \nstructures, before the 1970s, and family structures after the 1970s. The main difference is the \nincreased involvement and equality given to females in the workplace. The feminist shift pushed \ntowards equality and is the reason for why women started to feel somewhat equal to men, or their \npartner. As women began feeling a sort of equality or push towards equality, marriage rates and \nchildbirth rates started to decrease. This is most likely from the newly developed sense of \nindependence and ability to become financially stable by themselves that the feminist wave \npushed for. Back in a traditional family structure, the woman was dependent on her husband and \nher main tasks were to support the husband and children at home. Now, a woman can choose to \ndelay having a family all together, and become dependent on herself only. The idea of a family \ncan also shift and begin to change as women continue to find independence and equality.  \nAfter comparing and contrasting past moments and family structures in history, one can \ntackle the sociological question of \u201cwhat an American family will look like in 2035.\u201d In my \nopinion, I believe that marriage rates will slowly begin to decline, birth rates will decline, but, \nrelationships and marriages that are developed, will shift into a stronger sense of egalitarianism. I \nthink that women are continuing to view themselves as independent and continue to yearn for a \nmore equal standing to a man, whether that is in a family structure or a career.  \n\n5 \nAssessing my forward thinking, my first prediction is that I think marriage rates and birth \nrates might decline more. I believe that as time continues on, women are going to keep realizing \ntheir worth and potential, and push back with force. I believe that with a strong education and \ngrowing sense of self, that women will be able to identify their own needs and wants, and be able \nto travel down the path that is right for them, without influence. Bertrand et al., 2016 states that \n\u201cskilled women marry at a lower rate than unskilled women,\u201d which supports my belief that \nwomen with an education will choose to wait longer or marry or not get married at all. I believe \nthat having an education can open up one\u2019s eyes to the inequality at hand with men and women, \nand allow women to push back. An example that I am going to use to back this up is my own \nexperience. Before taking this Sociology of the Family course, I had a general understanding of \nthe inequality between men and women in a relationship, and just assumed that it would always \nbe that way. Now, with more education and understanding, I have a deeper knowledge of the \ninequality, where it stems, and how I can push back against it. I am learning to become more \nindependent and one with my goals, regardless of what another man or person says. With this \nnewfound sense of strength as a woman, my career plans have somewhat shifted, and so have my \ngoals for marriage. I used to want to get married at a young age, and be a mother. I still want \nthat, but now I find myself wanting more for myself and my career. This is a pretty big step for \nme, and I can attribute most of my independence and thinking to my education, this Sociology of \nthe Family class, and my newly developed understanding of gender inequality. Therefore, I \nbelieve that in the next ten years, marriage rates will slow down, ultimately affecting birth rates \nas well.  \nMy second prediction revolves around egalitarianism in a relationship. I believe that in \nthe next ten years, men and women are going to continue shifting to an egalitarian partnership \n\n6 \nand find more and more of a balance of equity. The reasons that I have for this prediction also \nrevolves around my own thinking and developments. I am in a relationship, and see a future with \nmy boyfriend. Although, during this class, I have begun to notice some things happening within \nthe relationship that are not up to my standards in equality. It is mainly little things, such as not \ncleaning his dishes, getting irritated when I ask him to get out of bed and turn off a light, or \npretending not to know how to do something so that I can do it for him. From my education \nduring this class, these small actions have begun to irritate me more and more, thus making me \nrealize that there is a sort of imbalance within our relationship. I can honestly identify a handful \nof things that he makes me do, solely because I am a woman. This used to not bother me, but \nthroughout my education, I have realized that this is not the relationship that I want to engage in. \nSo, I have started conversations with him about implementing new sorts of equity between us \nand our relationship. We are slowly working towards the theoretical egalitarianism structure that \nworks best for us, and I can honestly say that it is going great. From my own experience, I am \npredicting that educated women are going to push for more equity within their relationship, and \nshift into more of an egalitarian partnership that benefits themselves and their family.  \nTo conclude my predictions, I wholeheartedly think that these shifts will take place in \nskilled women, especially when educated in sociological perspectives and theories. The \nhistorical shift from past traditional families and relationships, to relationships now, support my \nprediction that there will be a continuation of the decline in marriage rates and birth rates. My \nown experiences and understandings of an egalitarian relationship is guiding my prediction of an \nincreased sense of equity within a partnership in 2035. Ultimately, I believe that American \nrelationships in 2035 are going to be defined by female independence, equity, and education.  \n \n\n7 \nReferences \nFinn, G. M., & Brown, M. E. L. (2022).

        "text": "Asiaf 1\n \n \n \nAbby Asiaf \n19 September 2025 \nSOC \u2013 250 \u2013 001  \nDr. Engelman  \nWhat is Justice?  \nMichael Joseph Sandel\u2019s book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d addresses \nhistorical debates and connects them to present day issues. The Harvard professor breaks down \nthe idea of justice with the help of philosophers Kant, Rawls, and Aristotle. This allows Sandel \nto dissect their ideas and give room to create a new perspective of today\u2019s justice. Sandel formed \nhis own view of what justice really means which he applied to society through principles of \nethics, moral reasoning, and government.  \nThroughout the book, Sandel explains to the reader how his version of justice could \npotentially change the way people act, think about right and wrong, and think about how society \nshould be governed. The first theory that Sandel brought up is utilitarianism, which suggests that \nthe best outcome would be the one that makes the most happiness for the most amount of people. \nWhen I read that, it sounded practical, but I think it depends on the situation that you are \npresented with. The rolling trolley and the Afghan goatherds were great illustrations of \nutilitarianism because they provoke the readers thought process of what you would do in that \nsituation. Based off these examples, I don't think you can always revert to utilitarianism aspects. \nThis is because when you are \u201cconfronted with this tension, we may revise our judgement about \nthe right thing to do or rethink the principle we initially espoused\u201d (pg.20), so depending on the \nsituation, the utilitarianism outcome might not be the most beneficial or fair decision for \neveryone. I've learned that utilitarian thinking doesn\u2019t always respect individuals enough, and \nthat unfortunately one person is punished even though they are innocent, for the greater good of \neveryone else.  \n\n \nAsiaf 2\n \n \n \nSandel also talks about libertarianism, which focuses on freedom and property rights. \nLibertarians do not want government interference and think that people should be free to make \ntheir own choices, even if others do not agree with them. After reading the five objections from \nthe libertarian point of view, objections 3 and 4 really stood out to me. Michael Jordan is one of \nthe most successful basketball players in the world. Some people do not think it\u2019s fair that he got \ncompensated so well and that he should be sharing \u201c... a portion of his earnings\u201d (pg.39) which is \nabsurd in my opinion. Although he made an insane amount of money and will never be able to \nspend all that money within his lifetime, it is not fair for people to assume that he owes them \nsomething. On the other hand, people are not given the same start and opportunities that Michael \nJordan had. I think that's why the libertarianism aspect can only work for certain things. This is \nbecause if freedom only means \u201cno interference,\u201d then that doesn't give people the freedom to \nmake their own choices. Libertarianism should not just be about freedom but should include \nfairness as well.  \nSandel addresses Kant\u2019s philosophy stating that the morality of an action isn\u2019t about the outcome \nbut more about the motive. When I read the example about the spelling bee, all I could think \nabout were people\u2019s moral compasses. I think a lot of people would have moved on in the \nspelling bee if they were put in the same situation as the young boy. The reason that this boy is \ndifferent is because \u201che knew it was the right thing to do, his act has moral worth regardless of \nthe pleasure or satisfaction that might attend it\u201d (pg.63). The boy felt guilty, which means his \nmoral compass was in the right place. I think it\u2019s important to look at Kant\u2019s perspective on \nmorality because he explains that if you do something for the right reasons, then it is okay to feel \ngood about it. I agree with this because you should do something because you meant it, not just \nto look good. Kant also brought up the idea that we should treat people as ends and not just \nmeans. This made me think about how in society, people are treated like numbers and not \n\n \nAsiaf 3\n \n \n \nrational beings. Kant reminds us that people are not things and that we deserve respect and \ndignity as long as we do what is right.  \nOne of the most interesting parts of the book for me was Sandel\u2019s discussion on John \nRawls. Rawls had the idea of a veil of ignorance where \u201cwe don\u2019t know our class or gender, our \nrace or ethnicity, our political opinions or religious convictions. Nor do we know our advantages \nand disadvantages -\u201d (pg.76) and I thought this was interesting because if our society was like \nthis everyone would have a fair start. If I didn\u2019t know who I\u2019d be in society, I would want it to be \nfair and equal for everyone. I wouldn\u2019t want there to be inequalities because what if I ended up at \nthe bottom? This made me think about policies being pushed today like progressive taxes or \nprograms that help people in poverty. This would help make society more inclusive and fairer \noverall.  \nSandel also talks about the philosopher Aristotle, who believes justice can be teleological \nand honorific. Sandel states that \u201cfor Aristotle, justice means giving people what they deserve, \ngiving each person his or her due\u201d (pg.99) which I think is fair in a way, but depends on what is \nbeing distributed. This is because it is not just about fairness, but also about purpose. Justice can \ndiscriminate depending on the situation. For example, when you talk about merit in schools, \nrelationships between people, or even talented artists, it's all according to relevant excellence but \neach is on a different scale. Everything a person does has a purpose and whether it is good or bad \nthat person will earn what they deserve.  \nThe last thing that Sandel addresses is the fact that we can\u2019t escape talking about values \nand the common good. Sandel favors this third approach because \u201cjustice is not only about the \nright way to distribute things. It is also about the right way to value things\u201d (pg.135) meaning \nsociety needs to reason with each other to be able to agree on the good things in life. Sandel \n\n \nAsiaf 4\n \n \n \nmade me realize that neutrality isn\u2019t possible. Issues such as marriage equality and healthcare \nforce us to think about what we really value as a whole. Trying to avoid the question doesn\u2019t \nchange anything but rather leaves the decision up to whoever has more power.  \nAfter reading this book, my perspective on justice has definitely changed. Sandel has \nhelped me realize that the idea of justice is a lot more complicated and not just based off fairness. \nJustice needs to balance outcomes, respect people\u2019s rights, and value certain things for the \ncommon good. In regard to each philosopher, I can see where they come from to a certain extent. \nI do believe that people have dignity that cannot be violated, and I also think that a good society \nshould promote fairness, responsibility and compassion. There needs to be willingness for \nchange though, for this to be able to happen. The theories of utilitarianism and libertarianism can \nbe helpful in some cases, but they are not strong enough to be an idea on their own.  \nReading Michael Sandel\u2019s book Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? was challenging \nbut rewarding at the same time. This book has opened my eyes to the complexities of what \njustice really is and has showed me that it is not only abstract, but also connected to everyday \nlife, politics, and society. This book allowed me to reflect on my own personal values, morals, \nand decision making. Sandel has also helped me understand the disagreements in our society \nsuch as taxes, healthcare, and affirmative action. These debates are not just based off facts, but \nabout moral principles and what society values as a whole. Overall, Sandel has taught me to look \nat issues through multiple perspectives and make a decision after exercising them all. I've learned \nthat justice is not just about making everyone happy, protecting freedom, or rewarding merit, but \nis more about engaging in moral reasoning and compromising together. Justice will always need \ndebates, reflection, and willingness to hear out different perspectives. Justice does not have a \nfixed or final answer but will always be an ongoing discussion. Justice will always raise \nquestions about fairness, freedom, and virtue but it is up to us to find the solutions that respect \n\n \nAsiaf 5\n \n \n \nboth individuals and our society. Our choices, the way we treat others, and the values we believe \nin all shape what justice looks like. It makes me think about what kind of society I want to be a \npart of, and what role I can play whether it's through voting or speaking up about equality or \nsomething else. I understand now that justice isn\u2019t just about the government but is also about the \nindividuals as well. This book has become very important to me, and I look forward to applying \nwhat I learned through Sandel and philosophers Kant, Rawls, and Aristotle into my everyday \nlife.",

        "text": "Chandler Coughlin \nDr.Engelman  \nSOC-345-001 \n23 October 2025 \nMidterm Paper: What 2035 Might Look Like \nWhen I think about what a family might look like in 2035, I don\u2019t picture just the old \nfashioned version with a mom, dad, two kids, and a dog behind a white picket fence. That image \nalready feels almost like an old Disney movie now. The families I know today rarely fit that \nmold. Some have single parents, others are blended through divorce and remarriage, and some \nhave two moms or two dads. There are even people who think of their close friends as family \nmore than their relatives. By 2035, I think this mix of families will just be seen as more normal, \nnot something that needs to be over explained. \nReading about how marriage and family have changed over time really opened my eyes. \nStephanie Coontz\u2019s chapter about the history of marriage made me realize how new our current \nidea of marrying for love actually is. For most of history, people didn\u2019t marry for romance, \nmarriage was about money, survival, or family alliances. Coontz explained that love used to be \nseen as risky or even irresponsible because it could make people act crazy. It\u2019s kind of funny to \nthink that marrying for love was once a rebellious act, now it\u2019s the opposite and most people \ncan\u2019t imagine marrying without it. \n\nAt the same time, putting love at the center of marriage has made relationships more \ncomplicated. When people expect love to do all the work, it often doesn\u2019t last. That\u2019s one reason \ndivorce rates went up over the past few decades, by 2035, I think people will still value love \ndeeply, but they\u2019ll approach it more realistically. Relationships might be less about fantasy and \nmore about emotional compatibility and mutual respect. I don\u2019t think everyone will want or need \nto get married, but the people who do might go into it with clearer expectations. \nOne of the most interesting ideas I came across was from Mignon Moore\u2019s work on \nLGBTQ+ families, she writes about how same sex couples had to fight to even be recognized as \n\u201clegitimate\u201d families. They often had to create \u201cchosen families,\u201d building support systems with \nfriends and loved ones who shared their values when society didn\u2019t. That really stuck with me \nbecause it shows how family isn\u2019t just about blood or legality but it\u2019s about care and connection. \nBy 2035, I imagine that kind of chosen family will be just as respected as any traditional \nhousehold. There might be more blended parenting arrangements, like two people raising a child \ntogether even if they aren\u2019t a romantic couple, or multiple adults co parenting in different ways. \nFamily law might even evolve to recognize more than two parents on legal documents. It \nwouldn\u2019t surprise me if workplaces updated benefits and leave policies to include all kinds of \nfamilies, not just the \u201cmarried with children\u201d type. \nThinking about gender roles, Arlie Hochschild\u2019s book The Second Shift really made an \nimpact on me. Her story about Nancy and Evan Holt still feels wild to me, even though it was \nwritten decades ago. Nancy worked full time but still did most of the housework and childcare, \nwhile Evan didn\u2019t see the problem. That kind of imbalance still happens, though we talk about it \nmore now. \n\nI think by 2035 we\u2019ll finally see more equality at home. Like we talked about in class, \nwith more remote jobs and flexible hours, it\u2019s becoming easier for parents to share \nresponsibilities. Younger generations also seem more aware of \u201cemotional labor\u201d the invisible \nwork of caring, planning, and maintaining relationships. I hope that by then, the idea of men \nhelping out around the house will sound outdated because both partners will automatically share \nthat load. \nWhat excites me most about the future of family is how emotionally open it could \nbecome. As a psychology major, I can\u2019t help but think that our generation values deep \ncommunication more than before. We talk about boundaries, therapy, and emotional health in \nways that used to be taboo. I think that will shape how people raise their kids too. Families in \n2035 might focus as much on emotional growth as they do on academics or discipline. Kids \ncould grow up seeing multiple healthy relationship models around them, not just one \u201cright\u201d way \nto live. \nOverall, I think the biggest change will be that family becomes something people design \nfor themselves instead of something society hands them. Coontz showed that love changed \nmarriage. Hochschild showed that equality inside families is still a work in progress. Moore \nshowed that family can exist far beyond traditional limits. Together, those ideas make me \nhopeful. \nWhen I picture a family in 2035, I see something diverse, flexible, and real. Maybe it\u2019s \ntwo parents who both work and share housework equally. Maybe it\u2019s a same-sex couple raising \nan adopted child. Maybe it\u2019s a group of close friends who support each other the way a family \nwould. Whatever form it takes, I think families will be stronger because they\u2019ll be built on \n\nchoice, empathy, and genuine connection instead of social pressure. And honestly, I think that\u2019s a \nbeautiful direction for us to be heading. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWorks Cited \nCoontz, Stephanie. \u201cThe Radical Idea of Marrying for Love.\u201d Marriage, a History: How Love \nConquered Marriage.

        "text": "\u200bAshley Hirschman\u200b\n\u200bSOC-345\u200b\n\u200b10/24/2025\u200b\n\u200bFrom present day until the year 2035, I anticipate that a rollercoaster of patterns and\u200b\n\u200btrends among families will come and go. Families have changed in a various amount of ways\u200b\n\u200bover the last several decades and are only progressing from the point they are at now. While the\u200b\n\u200bconcept of a family varies by person, it is textually defined by the relationship between a\u200b\n\u200bcaregiver, typically a parent, and the one receiving the care, typically a child. Many believe that\u200b\n\u200bfamily is only the ones you are biologically connected to, but the expansion of families that have\u200b\n\u200bbeen seen over the years has challenged that statement.\u200b\n\u200bOne subject that I am expecting to see a change in patterns through is motherhood and the\u200b\n\u200bwomen\u2019s role in the home. Women did not always have a say in what they were and were not\u200b\n\u200ballowed to do; women would stay at home instead of having careers by ensuring they are solely\u200b\n\u200bavailable to be caregivers and to take care of anything and everything around the home.\u200b\n\u200bHowever, not all women actually wanted to stay home. Enough women wanted to break out of\u200b\n\u200bthis cycle and create a career of their own to the point where they created a movement, which led\u200b\n\u200bto the allowance and rise of women\u2019s labor force participation. While we eventually got what we\u200b\n\u200bwanted, it was not necessarily what we were hoping for. The gender wage gap became a\u200b\n\u200bprominent issue immediately and is still an issue today. \u201cAmong full-time workers, women\u200b\n\u200bearned 81 cents on a man\u2019s dollar\u201d (Budig) just a decade ago, hence leaving that difference and\u200b\n\u200bcausing women to naturally be more behind than men financially in most standard careers. All of\u200b\n\u200bthis being said, I predict that, due to the state that our government is in right now, we will revert\u200b\n\n\u200bback a bit and possibly drop that cost within the next few years. At this moment it seems as if the\u200b\n\u200bgovernment is doing everything it can in order for its citizens to not become successful. The\u200b\n\u200bgovernment has taken away women\u2019s right to reproductive healthcare and also has removed\u200b\n\u200bseveral women in the workplace due to the sole reason that they were all women. Medicaid and\u200b\n\u200bSNAP have also been cut, and while this is an issue for everyone, single mothers are most often\u200b\n\u200bthe parents that struggle the most with their children and being able to afford to take care of\u200b\n\u200bthem. However, I do believe that if our government shapes itself differently in order to not\u200b\n\u200bintentionally harm its citizens, women\u2019s wages may be able to match men\u2019s among every career\u200b\n\u200bby 2035. Women have become much more vocal with the rise of activism and the gender wage\u200b\n\u200bgap is not going unnoticed, both on paper and financially. Women have always \u201cwrestled with\u200b\n\u200bconcerns about gender inequality in the labor market\u2026 despite the long-term increase in\u200b\n\u200bwomen's labor market attachment, substantial gender differentials persist in both participation\u200b\n\u200brates and hours,\u201d (Jacobs, Gornick). With this enhanced activism I also anticipate the advocacy\u200b\n\u200bof equal healthcare and benefits, leading to equality and assistance among every aspect between\u200b\n\u200bmen and women.\u200b\n\u200bI would also like to discuss the subject of queer and gay couples and their families. Gay\u200b\n\u200bcouples did not identify as families for centuries and are just now becoming more common and\u200b\n\u200baccepted by the population in recent years. There are still examples today of couples being\u200b\n\u200bdenied adoption or the option to begin a family in their own way simply due to the fact that they\u200b\n\u200bare gay. Gay marriage was not legalized in the United States until 2015 so the idea of a \u201cfamily\u201d\u200b\n\u200bwas set in stone and was not negotiable. While I hope to see a strong nationwide acceptance of\u200b\n\u200bthe acknowledgement of queer families, I do not think this will be reached by 2035. Though I do\u200b\n\u200banticipate seeing some progress, I do not believe that enough people will be open-minded and\u200b\n\n\u200baccepting to these couples due to religious purposes, social stigmas, and personal beliefs that\u200b\n\u200bhave been around forever. I only believe this to be the case, once again due to the state that our\u200b\n\u200bgovernment is currently in today. Our government is actively attempting to prevent any gender\u200b\n\u200baffirming care from happening, including transgender surgeries. The transgender community is\u200b\n\u200boutwardly bashed by the government and are not treated as true people, reversing the law\u200b\n\u200ballowing them to serve in the military as well as the removal of the law that protects\u200b\n\u200bdiscrimination against transgender citizens. The government is also considering reversing the bill\u200b\n\u200bthat allows gay marriage, which could cause gay couples to struggle even more to receive\u200b\n\u200bcredentials to be considered a family. If we are able to escape this mindset within the government\u200b\n\u200band queer couples become more protected, the higher the likelihood that queer families will be\u200b\n\u200baccepted and acknowledged. As a queer person myself, it feels like it is one step forward and\u200b\n\u200bthree steps back with the acceptance of the queer community. I believe a lot of it comes from the\u200b\n\u200bstigma that family is only your blood and that two people of the same sex cannot biologically\u200b\n\u200bhave a child together, therefore cannot \u201clegitimately\u201d make a family.\u200b\n\u200bAs briefly mentioned earlier, single mothers do typically struggle the most when it comes\u200b\n\u200bto families raising their children. The rise of single mothers becoming the face of a family has\u200b\n\u200bskyrocketed in the last few decades with help from the women\u2019s labor market. I believe that the\u200b\n\u200brepresentation of single mothers will only further from here. Women today have more financial\u200b\n\u200band personal independence. Workforce participation and higher education mean women can\u200b\n\u200bsupport children on their own if relationships end or if they choose to parent independently.\u200b\n\u200bWhile the gender pay gap and childcare costs remain challenges, women\u2019s economic power has\u200b\n\u200bstill grown enough to make single parenting more feasible, \u201cmothers earning 83.1 cents to a\u200b\n\u200bsingle custodial father\u2019s dollar (single moms are much less likely to be employed full-time\u200b\n\n\u200brelative to single dads is masked by this estimate among full-time workers)\u201d (Butig). There is\u200b\n\u200balso less of a safety net for women in the workforce in comparison to the safety net features men\u200b\n\u200breceive.\u200b\n\u200bWhile I hope to see some of these predictions in the future regarding families, I hope the\u200b\n\u200bmost that families are united. The main purpose of a family is to provide emotional support,\u200b\n\u200bsocialization, safety, and stability. It is crucial to develop safety nets in order to protect yourself\u200b\n\u200band your family and it is equally as important to care for one another. I hope we can all\u200b\n\u200beventually accept every family as they are, and that society realizes that family is not only\u200b\n\u200bbiological, it is a system of relationships built on love, trust, and shared experiences.\u200b\n\n\u200bReferences\u200b\n\u200bBudig, M.

        "text": "Cummings 1 \nCescily Cummings  \nSOC 345 \nDr. Engelman  \n10/24/25 \nMidterm Reflection: A Look Into The Future  \n \n\u200b\nOver time the idea of a family in the United States has dramatically shifted across \ngenerations. The traditional image of a family is a married couple, male and female, with \nchildren where the man is working and the woman stays home to care and attend to the house \nand children. This traditional family is nowadays not the normal household. Today we are seeing \nmarriage rates drop with an increase in divorce rates, women are now in the work force, there are \na lot of single parents raising children or having a blended family, and same sex marriages have \nevolved and their families are forming. Looking at this in the past perspective where there was \nonly the traditional family structure there has been drastic changes in really such a short amount \nof time. Looking ahead to the year 2035, ten years from now, I\u2019m positive we will still see \nchange.  \nIn today\u2019s society we are seeing less people getting married young and starting a family. Fewer \npeople are getting married in general and if they do, many are cohabiting first. Cohabitation is \nthe idea of a couple living together who are not married but are still in an intimate and committed \nrelationship. These couples can be both opposite sex or same sex. This has become very common \nand I would say the new norm. The idea is to see if you and your partner will work together by \nsharing a space before making the big commitment to get married. Research shows that \ncohabitation is associated with higher divorce rates and leads to more conflict within the \n\nCummings 2 \nrelationship. There are also higher rates of infidelity compared to couples who do not live \ntogether before marriage. Because of these trends we are seeing, some people are choosing to \nfocus on their careers instead of on a relationship or family.  \nWe are also seeing a huge shift in women\u2019s roles in society. Since the 1970s, women have \nstepped into the workforce and now have long term careers. This change has also brought a dual \nincome to the family whereas before, it was one income from the husband. Marriages now have \nto talk about how they want to divide up household responsibilities like bills and chores. In some \ncases this has led to more equal partnerships and less resentment but this is also why we are \nseeing changes in other social norms. Because women are now providing for themselves, they \nnow are not being tied down to a relationship because the man was the sole provider. This has \nled to a huge increase in divorce rates.  \nWomen are leaving their marriages and sometimes with their children. Which brings us to our \nnext topic of single parent families and blended families. This can be significantly difficult on \nboth the parent and the children. Living with one parent or splitting your time between both \nparents has become normalized because of how often we are seeing it in modern society. \nFamilies are also coming together and creating a new family with step parents and step siblings. \nIt is also important to point out that there is an increase of people  having children without being \nmarried.  \nLastly we are seeing an increase in LGBTQ families. Now that they are more socially accepted \nand same sex marriage became legal nationwide in 2015 we are seeing this as the new normal as \nwell. More couples have adopted and the journey of IVF has emerged. There are still blended \nfamilies in this case as well possibly from previous relationships.  \n\nCummings 3 \nThe newest trend which I find super interesting is the rise of stay at home dads. As we talked \nabout previously, in the past men were the providers and out working while the women were at \nhome. Today we are seeing men choosing and or needing to stay at home and care for their \nchildren while their partner works. I think the rise of this was mostly due to COVID 19. Since \nthen, jobs have shifted to a virtual at home option. This created a more flexible schedule \nallowing more fathers to spend time at home and taking on the caregiving responsibilities that \nused to fall onto the mothers plate. There have also been cultural shifts about what we see as \nmasculine in society. Being a hands-on father is seen as more admirable than unmanly nowadays. \nThere still is stigma surrounding the idea of a stay at home dad while the mother is the \n\u201cbreadwinner\u201d simply because of the traditional ideologies from previous generations.  \n By 2035, I believe we will continue to see a rise in new ideologies. The image of a \u201ctraditional \nbreadwinner\u201d will continue to shift along with economic trends and social expectations of a \nfather. I think fathers will continue to be more involved so I hope, but it not only benefits the \nmarriage but it is most important for the children. Being involved in your children\u2019s life can \nsignificantly improve their lives and lead to happier and healthier families overall.  \nThere are many influences that affect what 2035 will look like. Being a college student, the first \nthing on my mind is finding a stable job with a good income because of the rising costs in \neveryday life. Student debt makes it significantly harder for younger adults to afford having \nchildren and even marriages. I think because of this, we will see cohabitation continuing to rise \nand maybe not even in an intimate relationship but a friendship because of how expensive it is to \nlive. There is going to be a delay in having children but I think having children without a \nmarriage will also continue to increase. I do not necessarily agree that it is a smart and good \ndecision but the way the world is headed right now I would definitely expect that. The looks of a \n\nCummings 4 \nfamily will continue to grow in different forms. I think we will shift away from what a \u201cfamily \ntypically looks like\u201d and more of it comes in all shapes and sizes viewpoint. I don\u2019t think there \nwill be such a standard. I think more adults will choose themselves over a relationship. I think it \nis becoming more common that it is just easier to look after yourself. This class has really \nopened my eyes to the fact that less people do not want kids in general or to even get married. \nThere is such a strong hesitation with both aspects that I did not know about before.  \nThere is also the idea of not wanting to bring children into such a scary world. I have talked to \nmy family and friends about this a lot and my dream is to have kids and a loving family but a \npart of me is so worried about what the world will look like for them. I feel like I won\u2019t be able \nto protect them from the horrific reality of the current world we are living in. I can only hope to \nsee change and we as humans can do better.  \nIn conclusion, the world we see today will not be the same in 2035. We will continue becoming \nmore diverse and accepting. The roles of a family and what one will look like will continue to \nevolve into many different ways. As long as we accept and support this change as a society we \nwill thrive.",

        "text": "A Boy Broken: Reflection Paper \n \n'A Boy Broken' is a memoir written by Douglas J. Engelman in remembrance and honor \nof his son, Douglas J. Engelman, and his daughter, Melissa J. Horn. The book talks about \nEngelman's experience as a father navigating the challenges of his son's Schizophrenia and his \ndaughter's bipolar disorder, and the later tragic loss of them both. He revisits his son's struggles \nof dealing with constant psychotic episodes and the impact that they had on everyone in the \nfamily. For me, this memoir was extremely eye-opening. Not only did it broaden my \nunderstanding of what it is like for someone to live with schizophrenia, but it also unveiled the \nemotional burden that is placed on their loved ones. I was especially touched by how resilient \nand dedicated his family was to supporting Douglas Jr. through his journey. In this essay, I will \nbe explaining how I responded to the memoir, emotionally, the valuable lessons that I learned \nabout how mental health can affect individuals as well as their family dynamics, and how \nEngelman's story strongly resonates with my own personal experience supporting my brother. \n \nA Boy Broken by Douglas J. Engelman is a personal memoir that chronicles a father\u2019s \njourney through the heartbreak of losing his son to mental illness and, ultimately, to a tragic \nending. The story opens with Engelman\u2019s raw and emotional recollection of the moment he \nlearned about his son\u2019s death. This was a moment that flipped his world upside down and \nchanged his perspective forever. From there, his storyline takes a shift back in time to when they \nfirst started to see early signs of his son\u2019s schizophrenia. Engelman recounts how he first began \nnoticing changes in his son\u2019s behavior and personality. They were so subtle at first, but soon \nbecame impossible to ignore. \n\nAs the diagnosis of schizophrenia became more and more clear ot them, Engelman \ndescribes the overwhelming fear, confusion, and helplessness that he felt trying to navigate his \nnew life as well as his family. His book explores the deep emotions of a parent confronting their \nworst fear of something they can't fully understand or control, as well as fight the neverending \nstigma and misunderstanding surrounding such as severe mental illness. Engelman shares how \nhis family struggled to find effective treatments, navigate medical systems, medication changes, \ntherapy, and hospitalizations. \nMy initial reaction to reading \u201cA Boy Broken\u201d was sadness, but more than anything, I \nfelt empathy. Part of me knows exactly what it feels like to watch someone you love lose \nthemselves entirely. My older brother, Jasper, is three years older than me and was recently \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder, even though he has shown symptoms for nearly a decade now. \nWhen we were younger, he was my whole world. He was the happiest kid, curious about \neverything, adventurous, and constantly full of energy. He loved playing soccer in his free time, \nreading, going on bike rides, and spending time with his friends. He would teach me how to play \nvideo games, even though I was terrible at them, but I still loved it because it meant I got to learn \nabout the things he loved.  \n\u200b\nAround the time Jasper turned fourteen, things began to change quickly. He stopped \nenjoying soccer and spending time with friends. At first, we all thought he was just burnt out \nfrom soccer or going through a normal teenage phase of being disinterested in everything. But as \nthe years went on, he became more and more irritable and angry. He spent most of his time alone \nin his room playing video games, and his anger started to quickly spiral. One night, I woke up to \nfind him standing in the kitchen, swinging a knife at my dad after my dad had unplugged the wifi \nto make him go to bed. I later overheard my mom tell my dad that she feared they might have to \n\ncall the police someday if things continued to get worse. Over time, Jasper became more \nisolated. His grades plummeted drastically, he barely spoke to us, and the strain of all of our \nrelationships began to weigh the structure of our family down.  \n\u200b\nWhen he graduated high school in 2020, we hoped things would change but they didn\u2019t. \nFor the past five years, he has lived in his dark, cold room, playing video games while his mental \nhealth, as well as our relationship with him, continued to deteriorate. The most traumatizing \nmoment occurred during my junior year of high school, when I walked in on my dad and Jasper \nin a physical fight. I watched as my dad fell backward and hit his head on the corner of a wall. It \nwas the first time I saw Jasper truly break down, he was overwhelmed by the guilt and \nheartbreak of hurting someone. After that night, we never spoke about it again. Even though his \naggressive behavior lessened, his emotions disappeared entirely. He became detached from the \nworld completely.  \n\u200b\nTherapists came and went until he finally found one he connected with. Over the \nsummer, he told my parents that he didn\u2019t love them and that he sees them only as roommates. \nWhen my parents responded by saying, \u201cWe love you no matter what,\u201d he asked, \u201cWhy would \nyou love me if I don\u2019t love you?\u201d Hearing that broke my mother in ways I\u2019ve never seen before. \nShe is the strongest person I know and never gets emotional, but I remember finding her curled \nup in the corner of her study, crying for hours. My dad, on the other hand, said nothing. I can tell \nthat his silence his way of staying strong for all of us. For reasons I still don\u2019t understand, the \nonly person Jasper says he loves is me. My parents and his therapist have told me that I\u2019m \u201cthe \nonly one who can reach him, you\u2019re his only hope.\u201d While that might sound encouraging, to me \nit feels like an unbearable weight that I\u2019ve carried around for years. I never asked to be the one \nholding our family together, but somehow, that\u2019s the role I\u2019ve accumulated. More than anything, \n\nall I\u2019ve ever wanted was to go back to being a normal family. One that eats dinner together, talks \nabout their day, and celebrates each other\u2019s achievements. But that dream faded when I realized \nthat my brother was now a stranger. He didn\u2019t know anything about my life, my friends, never \ncame to my graduation, and stopped saying happy birthday to any of us years ago. Although we \nonly just found out that he\u2019s been experiencing Bipolar disorder, the effects of it have ripped our \nfamily apart from the inside out, and I can only hope that this diagnosis is the answer to it all.",

        "text": "What will an American Family Look like in 2035? \nIntroduction \nThe idea of what makes a family in America has always changed over time. Families today look \nvery different from those of fifty years ago, and by the year 2035, they will likely look even more \ndifferent. In recent years, we have seen a steady decline in marriage rates, more women \nworking outside the home, and new types of family structures such as single parents, blended \nfamilies, and same-sex couples raising children. These changes suggest that the American \nfamily is becoming more diverse and flexible than ever before. \nIn the future, \u201cfamily\u201d may no longer have a single definition. Instead of being based only on \nmarriage or biological ties, family may be defined by emotional bonds, shared values, and \npersonal choice. This essay explores what the typical American family might look like in 2035. It \nwill consider the decline in marriage, changing gender roles, the rise of single-parent and \nblended families, and the growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ families. These predictions are not \nbased on statistics but on what we already know about social changes and cultural values that \ncontinue to shape our society. \n \nThe Changing Meaning of Marriage \nBy 2035, marriage will likely mean something very different from what it meant in the past. Many \npeople will still choose to marry, but marriage might no longer be seen as a required step in \nadulthood. Instead, it may be viewed as a personal choice or a celebration of love rather than \nan expectation from society. \nYoung adults in 2035 might focus more on education, careers, and personal goals before \nthinking about marriage. Some might decide never to marry at all. Living together without \nmarriage will likely be completely normal, and couples may choose to build families, raise \nchildren, or buy homes together without feeling pressure to make it official through a wedding or \nlegal paperwork. \nIn short, marriage will become more about personal meaning and emotional connection than \nabout tradition or social approval. This change doesn\u2019t mean that love or commitment will \ndisappear, it just means people will find new ways to show those values. Relationships will be \nbuilt on partnership and shared goals rather than on economic dependence or cultural \nexpectations. \nBy 2035, we might see marriage as one of many ways to express long-term commitment, not \nthe only one. Some couples may still want traditional ceremonies and legal recognition, while \nothers might celebrate their unions in different ways, based on their own beliefs and lifestyles. \n\n \nGender Roles and Family Responsibilities \nThe division of labor within families will continue to change in 2035. The idea that men should \nbe the main breadwinners and women should handle most of the childcare and housework is \nalready fading, and by 2035 it may feel completely outdated. \nMost households will likely have both partners working full-time or part-time jobs. Women will \ncontinue to hold leadership roles in business, education, and politics. Men, on the other hand, \nwill take on more equal roles in parenting and household tasks. Sharing responsibilities equally \nwill become a normal expectation, not something unusual. \nTechnology will also make balancing work and family easier. Many parents may work from home \nor have flexible schedules that allow them to be more present in their children\u2019s lives. However, \nthis could also blur the lines between work and home life. Parents may find it hard to \u201cunplug\u201d \nfrom their jobs, which might create new challenges in maintaining quality family time. \nStill, the future family will value equality, teamwork, and flexibility. Parenting will no longer be \nseen as mainly a mother\u2019s role. Instead, it will be seen as something both parents (or all \ncaregivers) share equally. These changes will likely create more balanced and cooperative \nfamily environments. \n \nSingle-Parent and Blended Families \nSingle-parent families will continue to be a major part of American life by 2035. The difference is \nthat society will no longer see them as \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cincomplete.\u201d Instead, single parents will be \nrespected for their independence, responsibility, and ability to manage both work and family life. \nAdvances in reproductive technology may also make it easier for people to become parents on \ntheir own if they choose to. Society will likely be more supportive of single parents through \nimproved childcare services, flexible work policies, and community-based support systems. \nBlended families, those formed when parents remarry or form new partnerships will also \nbecome more common. Because people will marry later and divorce will remain a normal part of \nlife, more families will include step-parents, step-siblings, and half-siblings. These families will \nchallenge the old idea that being \u201crelated\u201d means sharing the same bloodline. \nChildren in blended families will grow up with a broader understanding of family as something \nbuilt on love and care rather than just biology. The word \u201cfamily\u201d may come to mean anyone who \nprovides love, support, and a sense of belonging, whether or not they are related by blood. \n \n\nLGBTQ+ Families and the Expanding Definition of Family \nBy 2035, LGBTQ+ families will be an accepted and celebrated part of society. \u201cIn 2015, \nsame-sex marriages became legal nationally, and since then there has also been an increase in \nthe proportion of Americans in same-sex marriages. In 2021, there were over 700,000 \nsame-sex married couples in the United States, accounting for approximately 1% of all married \ncouples\u201d-Pew Research. Same-sex couples raising children, transgender parents, and \nco-parenting arrangements among close friends will all be common. Society will move further \naway from defining family in terms of gender or traditional marriage. \nChildren raised in these families will grow up with a stronger sense of acceptance and equality. \nThey may also have more open-minded views about gender, relationships, and what makes a \nfamily. The structure of families will depend on emotional support and shared responsibilities, \nnot necessarily on legal documents or traditional roles. \nThe idea of chosen families, groups of friends or loved ones who function like a family will \nbecome increasingly important. In a fast-changing world, many people may find that their \nstrongest emotional support comes from people they choose rather than those they are related \nto. This broader definition of family will help many people feel more connected and supported, \nregardless of their background or identity. \n \nCultural Diversity and Changing Family Patterns \nAmerica will continue to grow more culturally and racially diverse, and families will reflect that \ndiversity. By 2035, interracial and intercultural relationships will be even more common. Children \nin these families may grow up speaking multiple languages and learning different cultural \ntraditions. \nImmigrant families will also continue to play an important role in shaping family life. In many \ncultures, extended families live together or share child-rearing responsibilities. This may become \nmore common across all backgrounds as housing costs rise and families look for ways to \nsupport each other. \u201cLiving in a multigenerational household appears to offer protection against \nfalling into poverty, according to census data\u201d-Pew Research.  \nLiving in multigenerational homes, where grandparents, parents, and children share the same \nhousehold, could become more popular. These arrangements not only save money but also \nhelp strengthen family ties and provide built-in support for childcare and elder care. \nFamilies in 2035 will likely blend many traditions, foods, and customs, creating rich and diverse \nhousehold cultures. The future American family will truly reflect the mix of people and \nbackgrounds that make up the country. \n \n\nEconomic Challenges and Family Resilience \nEven with all this diversity, families will still face major economic challenges. The high cost of \nhousing, education, and healthcare will continue to shape family decisions. Some people may \ndelay having children or decide to have smaller families because of financial pressures. \nWorking parents may struggle to afford childcare, while others might depend more on relatives \nor friends for help. These challenges could lead to more cooperation among families and \ncommunities. For example, neighbors might share childcare duties, or multiple families might \nchoose to live together to reduce costs. \nEconomic inequality will continue to affect what families can and cannot do. Wealthier families \nwill have more options for flexible work and childcare, while lower-income families may have \nfewer resources. Despite this, families in 2035 are likely to be resourceful and creative. They will \nfind new ways to build stability and happiness even in difficult circumstances. \n \nConclusion \nThe American family in 2035 will not look like the traditional families of the past. Instead, it will \nbe defined by variety, flexibility, and inclusion. Marriage will still exist, but it will no longer be the \nonly or even the main path to forming a family. More women will lead in the workforce, and \ngender roles will continue to blend. Single-parent and blended families will be fully accepted, \nand LGBTQ+ families will be seen as a natural part of society. \nCultural diversity and new technologies will make families more dynamic and adaptable, while \neconomic pressures will challenge them to find new ways to stay strong and supportive. \nThe biggest feature of the family in 2035 will be its flexibility. Families will adapt to changing \ntimes, value love and cooperation over tradition, and find strength in diversity. The meaning of \nfamily will continue to expand, showing that what truly defines it is not structure or status, but \nthe care, support, and commitment shared by those who choose to call each other family. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nReferences: \nAragao, C., Parker, K., Greenwood, S., Baronavski, C., & Mandapat, J.

        "text": "Anna Palmer \nSOC-250-001 \n21 September 2025 \nReflection #1 \nMichael J. Sandel is a Professor at Harvard University. He has taught political philosophy \nsince 1980 and lives in Brookline, Massachusetts. In his book, \u2018Justice: What\u2019s The Right Thing \nTo Do?,\u2019 he speaks on the developments of morality and justice through different philosophers \nthroughout history, as well as how it applies to situations in society today. Throughout the book, \nhe provides us with many pressing issues in society and the development of the issues over \nhistory. He provides debates about college acceptances, surrogate mothers, abortion, same sex \nmarriage, and many more. The book was intended to draw up questions about what is considered \n\u201cright\u201d versus what is considered \u201cgood\u201d. It was written to progress one\u2019s understanding of \nmorality and justice. \nWhen reflecting on this book, one of the main debates that I felt I could connect with the \nmost throughout real life was the debate on college acceptances. When I was applying to \ncolleges, I didn't have many extracurriculars to put on my application. I did gymnastics growing \nup, meaning I trained 17 hours a week for ten years of my life. I was also the head coach of one \nof the gymnastics teams and would coach 8 hours a week. I was able to fit in a few clubs, such as \nthe Food Ark and Nation Organization for Women, but not nearly as much as most people were. \nI kept up good grades and finished high school with above a 4.0 GPA. While all seven of my \nweekdays were slammed, it still looked like I did very little in my free time on my applications. \nMost people had more clubs and were able to take Wake Tech classes, I was barely getting \nthrough all the responsibilities I already had. So, while applying to colleges, I looked much less \n \n\nimpressive than many others applying. This reduced the amount of colleges that I was accepted \ninto. Friends of mine that had lower GPAs and more quantity of extracurriculars were accepted \ninto colleges that I was not. \nIn Chapter 7, \u201cArguing Affirmative Action,\u201d it speaks on this debate, what should be \nconsidered when accepting people into colleges. On page 169 it says, \u201cA 700 SAT score from a \nstudent who attended poor public schools in the South Bronx means more than the same score \nfor a graduate of an elite private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But assessing test \nscores in light of students\u2019 racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds does not challenge the \nnotion that colleges and universities should admit those students with the greatest academic \npromise; it is simply an attempt to find the most accurate measure of each individual's academic \npromise.\u201d An SAT score is not the measure of one\u2019s academic success, but rather one\u2019s academic \npotential. The idea is that someone from an elite private school would have more time and \nresources to study for the SAT to in turn get a greater score. Someone in a poorer neighborhood \nand school would likely have less time to study due to family and money struggles. They would \nalso likely have less resources due to budget within the school and lack of ability to pay for \npersonal classes. These are all issues that happen in real life and create an education gap between \nstudents. It is important to weigh these things when it comes to acceptances into colleges. This is \ndiscussed on pages 178 and 179 where it says, \u201cThe belief that jobs and opportunities are \nrewards for those who deserve them runs deep, perhaps more so in the United States than in \nother societies. Politicians constantly proclaim that those who \u201cwork hard and play by the rules\u201d \ndeserve to get ahead, and encourage people who realize the American dream to view their \nsuccess as a reflection of their virtue.\u201d It is assumed that if one does what they are told and do \nthe right thing, they will get ahead of others. However, since not everyone comes from the same \n \n\nbackground, it is difficult to determine that everyone has a fair starting position. Maybe someone \nwho comes from a wealthy family has connections for internships and are able to put themselves \nout there easier while someone who comes from a poorer family has to work to afford college \nand doesn\u2019t have time for an unpaid internship that could put them in the position to work in the \nfield they want to be in. \nWhile my situation with less time for other clubs and activities is much less of an issue, it \ncan still tie into this debate. Is it fair for one who does not understand the amount of time and \nwork that comes with being a gymnast to review my application? Is it fair for one to make a \njudgement on my time management levels when they do not understand that I would leave \nschool to go to a five hour practice before even starting the homework I had for the night? While \nthere is not a direct answer to these questions, we can look into the morality and justice behind \nwhy people are accepted into colleges that they are. Earlier in the book, on page 154, it states, \n\u201cOne way of remedying this unfairness is to correct for social and economic disadvantage. A fair \nmeritocracy attempts to do so by going beyond merely formal equality of opportunity.\u201d While \nthis is not directly about the college acceptance debate, it ties into it quite nicely. When looking \nat this through the lens of college acceptances, we can see that while college admissions may not \nknow the differences between sports or how much time they take up, we can see that they try to \ngo beyond looking at economic and schooling opportunities. They want to see what you did with \nyour time, how well you were able to keep up with your academics with the extracurriculars you \nwere participating in, and how involved you were with said extracurriculars. They want to see \nthat you took initiative and did these things all out of your free will and motivation. So, morally \nit may be seen as wrong since there will be some colleges that find it more important for you to \nbe participating in sports while some may believe clubs are more important. Morality will be \n \n\ndifferent between different colleges, but justice will stay very similar or the same. Justice is the \nequality that the book was talking about. It is important to look into the way each student lived, \nmaybe they had more time for extracurriculars and maybe they didn't have any time. This doesn't \nmean that one student is better than another, it just means that each person comes from a \ndifferent background and it is important to understand that when accepting people into colleges. \nAnother very important debate that I found very interesting to read about was the same \nsex marriage debate. Religion was brought up many times and how one\u2019s morality should not \ncross into the justice of others. In the book, on page 253, it states, \u201cCan you decide whether the \nstate should recognize same-sex marriage without entering into moral and religious controversies \nabout the purpose of marriage and the moral status of homosexuality?\u201d This is asking us to think \nabout whether we can say if same-sex marriage is fair without bringing up our own personal \nbeliefs and moral standards. The book then says, \u201cSome say yes, and argue for same-sex \nmarriage on liberal, nonjudgmental, grounds: whether one personally approves or disapproves of \ngay and lesbian relationships, individuals should be free to choose their marital partners. To \nallow heterosexual but not homosexual couples to get married wrongly discriminates against gay \nmen and lesbians, and denies them equality before the law.\" This is claiming that despite the \ndifferentiations on morality between people in society, same-sex marriage is still something that \nis justified because everyone should be allowed to marry who they want to marry. Getting \nmarried to someone should not be prohibited by law according to justice. Later in the book, on \npage 255, it says, \u201cIf marriage were an entirely private affair, \u2026 all the disputes over gay \nmarriage would become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of \ngovernement, but neither would straight marraige.\u201d If marriage is private and between two \npeople, then it would not be of issue to anyone else. The argument that I hear often is, \u201cif it has \n \n\nno effect on you, why should you be worried about it.\u201d This argument is very important and ties \ninto the quote pulled from the book above. Why would one worry about what others choose to do \nwith their lives if it has nothing to do with them? The only argument that I have heard in \nresponse is that it is against what God would want. In this case, we can go back to the morality \nargument and say that religion has zero place in deciding whether people should be allowed to \nget married or not. \nThrough reading this book, it changed my perspective on how I look at certain issues. It \nraised questions that I would have never thought of and provided me with greater insight on \nmorality versus justice. Morality and justice are both very big issues in society today and people \ntend to have a very difficult time differentiating between the two of them. In conclusion with \nwhat I have read, morality is the public\u2019s ideologies and thoughts on certain issues, while justice \nis the balance of virtue, freedom, and welfare. Justice is the most important thing to look into \nwhen understanding different societal issues.",

        "text": "Reflection on A Boy Broken by Douglas Engleman \nCaitlyn Ward \nSOC-433-01 \nDouglas Engleman's A Boy Broken is not a book that skirts around pain. It looks straight at what \nit is to love someone who is seriously struggling with their mental health and to be part of a \nfamily that is trying to hold itself together through that pain. Reading this book hit close to home \nfor me because I\u2019ve seen what happens when mental illness enters a family. It doesn\u2019t just affect \none person. It changes everything; the way people talk, how they act, how they feel about each \nother, and even how they see themselves. \nEngleman\u2019s story about his son made me think a lot about my own brother. He\u2019s struggled with \nserious depression for years, and it hasn\u2019t been a quiet struggle. There have been multiple \nsuicide attempts. There have been nights when everything felt like it might fall apart. There have \nbeen stays in psychiatric wards, moments of fear I\u2019ll never forget, and stretches of time where \nour family felt like it was barely holding itself together. As in Engleman's book, the pain in our \nhouse wasn't just my brother's pain; it became everyone's. My parents were scared, tired, and \nnot sure what to do. My dad hadn't had to handle much mental illness before all of this, so he \nwas learning along with us. That meant not just learning about hospitals, meds, or symptoms, \nbut learning how to sit with something that doesn't have any easy answers. \nWhen one of us is hurt, the whole family feels the pain. My brother's pain did not stay his own; it \ninvaded the way the rest of us lived. My parents' relationship was strained. There were many \nfights that were not really about each other but about fear. My mom and dad handled things \ndifferently. My mom had to talk about everything and hold on to things. My father was more \nsubdued at first, as though he didn't know what to term what he was feeling. As time passed, he \nhad to adapt, to learn how to be there in the life of someone whose mental illness he didn't quite \nunderstand. Engleman describes the same sort of learning in his book. A father who was \nsuddenly and unexpectedly propelled into the world of mental illness, trying to learn, to assist, \nand not lose himself in the process. That resonated. I watched my dad slowly change over the \nyears. I think the possibility of losing my brother compelled him to change in ways he never \nthought possible.  \nWith a family like this growing up, there is a lot that goes unspoken. When someone in the \nhouse is struggling with something as heavy as depression, everyone starts walking on \neggshells, even without realizing it. You start to try not to say anything incorrectly, not to bring \nany more stress. Sometimes you do not say anything at all. There were moments when I felt like \nI had to be the \"good\" one, the one who did not cause trouble, who did not add to my parents' \nstress. Reading about the emotional toll on Engleman's family, I saw my own. When tragedy is \nhappening to someone you love, you start compartmentalizing parts of yourself to make room \nfor their pain. It's not something people tell you to do. You just do. \n\nOne of the most powerful things in the book was how Engleman describes holding on to hope. \nHope sounds easy to have, but when you\u2019re in a situation like this, it\u2019s anything but that. It\u2019s \nhard. You\u2019re constantly hoping this time things will be different. That the treatment will work. \nThat the phone won\u2019t ring in the middle of the night with devastating news. That your family will \nfinally get a break from the hold of mental illness. I know that weight. When my brother was in \nthe hospital, there was this mix of hope and fear that existed in all of us. It was exhausting to \nkeep hoping and, at the same time, be ready to be disappointed. I saw how my parents were \nexhausted from holding that hope too. It did not necessarily equate to the fact that they no \nlonger cared; if anything, they cared so much that it hurt. But it wore all of us down. \nReading about a family experiencing so much also made me consider the other end of it, the \nguilt of being the person in the hospital. I had my own inpatient stay for anorexia. It was a hard, \nscary process, and even though I was trying to survive my own battle, a part of me couldn't help \nbut think about how it was affecting my parents. I remember being in the hospital bed and \nthinking about how my mom was probably at home, blaming herself, and my dad was probably \ntrying to be strong and act like he was fine when he wasn't. That guilt stayed with me. Even \nwhile I was getting help, I felt like I was making more problems for them. It's something that \nEngleman's book depicts so perfectly, not so much guilt on the part of the one struggling, but the \nreality that families are all intertwined in a manner where one person's pain always pulls on the \nothers. \nWhen mental illness comes into a family, relationships change. Some bonds grow stronger; \nothers are tested. I\u2019ve seen my parents fight in ways they probably wouldn\u2019t have if they weren\u2019t \ncarrying so much pain and stress. I\u2019ve seen my dad be shut down emotionally because he didn\u2019t \nknow how else to handle everything. I\u2019ve seen my mom break down because she felt helpless. \nAnd I\u2019ve felt my own role shift between being a sister, a supporter, and at times, someone \nstruggling myself. Engleman doesn\u2019t sugarcoat this reality in A Boy Broken. He shows how love \ncan exist alongside exhaustion, frustration, and fear. That felt honest to me. Love doesn\u2019t \ndisappear when someone is sick, but it gets tested. \nAnother thing the book gets right is the quiet form of grieving that families do. It's not always \nnecessarily about losing a person physically, though sometimes it is, but losing how life used to \nbe. Life wasn't always easy before my brother got sick, but it didn't have the fear factor \nunderlying it. When depression took over his life, it took something from the rest of us as well. \nThere is grief in watching someone you love lose themselves to their illness, even when they \nare standing physically in front of you. There is grief in knowing that your family will never quite \nbe what it used to be again. I saw my parents change. I changed too. \nThere is another important element to this story, the guilt that lies in each and every person's \nheart. My father was guilty for having no clue how to handle mental illness. My mother was \nguilty for not being able to fix everything. I was guilty for being both a part of the family trying to \ncope with the pain of my brother, and, at one point, the source of my parents' further worry with \nmy own issues with mental illness. \n\nEngleman speaks of his paternal guilt, of what he could have done differently. That kind of guilt \nis one that I comprehend, not just secondhand from my parents, but firsthand. I do know what it \nis like to feel like a burden, even when people tell you that you are not. I know what it is like to \nwant your pain not to cause pain for the people who love you. What struck me about the way \nEngleman writes is that through everything his family goes through, they never stop attempting \nto learn and grow. My family has done the same thing. My dad, with no mental health \nexperience, learned little by little to talk about it. He learned to ask more questions. He learned \nto sit in the lack of control. It wasn't perfect, but it was progress. \nI've also learned to talk about things I once kept secret. I didn't tell people for a long time what \nwas going on with my brother or with me. I thought silence would make all of it easier. It didn't. \nWhat I've learned is that families can't navigate pain like this alone. It takes learning, support, \nand a great deal of painful honesty. \nReading A Boy Broken was not simple as it mirrored so much of my life. It made me understand, \nthough, that these stories need to be told. Mental illness is not just a personal battle; it's a family \nstory. It touches every member of the family. It tests love but also shows how deep that love \ngoes. The book also reminded me that hope, pain, and guilt can exist together. It's not tidy, it's \nmessy, but it's real. And even though the pain may never go away, families can evolve and \nchange as a result of it. \nWhen mental illness enters a family, nothing is the same again. I've lived it. I've seen my brother \nbattle depression and survive more than once. I've seen my parents work to stretch themselves \nto the breaking point to hold everything together. I've lain in the hospital myself, bearing both the \nweight of my own illness and the guilt of what that did to the people that I love. Engleman's story \nis so deeply personal, and yet it's not just his story; it's a story with which so many families \nconnect, mine included. It shows the devastation, the learning, and the love that still holds on \neven when it's tested to its limits.",

        "text": "Caldwell 1 \nA Boy Broken: Reflection  \nScary, violent, volatile, psycho, deranged . All words in which I have heard used when \ndescribing the mental disorder schizophrenia. Perhaps the 2019 film Joker is responsible for \nputting these ideas into my head. At the time, I would have only been 15 years old when I \nwatched it. Joker is a psychological thriller in which the main character, Arthur, suffers from \ndelusions and social neglect as a result of a broken mental health system. I recall watching a \nYouTube video after the film, in which it broke down all the ways Arthur\u2019s character was \nschizophrenic. Though it was never explicitly said in the movie, the connections being made \nbetween the character and the disorder were evident. This depiction of schizophrenia is the only \none that the media and pop culture display. I had never heard of a positive or even normal \ndepiction of schizophrenia until I read A Boy Broken. \n\u200bI experienced many emotions when reading A Boy Broken. At times, I felt sadness, \nsympathy, frustration, and more. What I felt most, though, was a sense of realness and \nauthenticity, hearing the story of a real individual's struggle with schizophrenia. I felt the reality of \nthis disorder. Rather than schizophrenia being an otherworldly affliction, I felt the pain, \nconfusion, and a father's dedication to his son. Through this reflection, I'd like to explore the \nrealities of schizophrenia through Doug's experiences, the stigmatization surrounding mental \ndisorders, and my own personal connection with mental disorders through my experiences with \nOCD. \nI can only imagine what being in the position of having schizophrenia would feel like. I \nimagine it is very lonely and confusing. What I\u2019ve never thought of, though, until I read this book, \nis how it would feel to be the loved one of an individual with schizophrenia. I imagine these \nsame emotions of loneliness and confusion are felt, but in a very different way. At the beginning \nof the book, before Doug truly knew what was affecting his son, they were on their way to \nMcDonald's. While Doug is trying to comprehend and make sense of what Doug Jr. is going \n\nCaldwell 2 \nthrough, he learns of his son's hallucinations, named Dave and Wendy. \u201cThey can put their \nhands inside me-stop them Dad, please make them stop (p.g. 14)\u201d. Reading the story in this \nmoment, I could feel the absolute terror a father must have felt hearing his son beg for his help \nbut knowing there is nothing he can do. Throughout the book, I found myself placing myself in \nthe author's shoes, imagining that Doug Jr. was my child or perhaps more appropriately for this \ntime in my life, my parent or sibling. \n\u200b\nAs I continued through the book, there were many moments in which I felt like Doug\u2019s \nstory was allowing me to get a glimpse into the reality of this disorder. Many moments where I \nfelt I was gaining insight about schizophrenia came during the caregiving parts of the book. In \nthe past, it hadn\u2019t occurred to me the emotional and practical strain that having a loved one with \na mental disorder can put on a family. These moments stood out to me when tough love was \nneeded. It\u2019s never easy to tell someone you love no but it was important for Doug to tell his son, \neven though it may have been difficult. In one instance, Doug jr lost or had his money stolen on \nmultiple occasions. When reading this, I can recall thinking how difficult it would be to have to \nwonder if Doug Jr.\u2019s money was truly being stolen, if he was lying, or if this was a hallucination. \nAnother moment I felt that I was gaining a new perspective on schizophrenia and the \nway in which it impacts the individual and those around them was when Doug Jr. went missing \nfor weeks. During this period, Doug was calling and searching shelters in hopes of finding his \nson. He writes in the book how he was unable to focus on work or anything really without the \nconstant wonder of where his son may be. The fear and helplessness a parent must feel when \nknowing their mentally disordered child is on the streets, not knowing if he's alive or safe, is \nunimaginable. This part of Doug's story highlighted to me how this disorder affects not only the \nindividual living with it but also those around them. The disorder consumes those who care most \nfor the individual. It really made me think about how emotionally exhausting and draining it must \nbe to care for a loved one going through this. \n\nCaldwell 3 \nDue to my own personal experiences, which I will touch on later, I've understood the \nstigma that surrounds mental disorders for a few years. However, while reading A Boy Broken, I \nrealized just how deeply these stigmas affect the lives of those experiencing mental disorders \nand those around them. One part that stood out to me most was Doug\u2019s choice to refrain from \ntelling his neighbors and friends about Doug Jr.\u2019s schizophrenia diagnosis. It seems Doug \nbelieved telling those around him about his son's reality would shatter the image of a perfect, \nnormal, put-together life he had worked hard to build. When neighbors would ask about Doug \nJr., he would often make up stories saying his son was still at school, even though in reality he \nwas in a treatment facility. Though Doug would go on to tell some of his extended family, like his \nparents, it saddened me to read that he was surprised by how supportive they were. Due to the \nstigma that surrounds schizophrenia and other mental disorders, Doug was fearful of a negative \nreaction from his family. Perhaps they would think differently of him and his son, or judge them? \nThis is a completely substantiated fear due to the stigma that surrounds mental disorders and \none that can only be stopped through the destigmatization of mental disorders. Doug\u2019s fear and \nuncertainty regarding how his family would react to his son's diagnosis showed the isolation \nthose caring for a loved one with a mental disorder experience due to the rejection and \njudgment that may come if they are open. \n\u200b\nAs mentioned above, I have had my own struggles and experiences with mental \ndisorders. I do not wish to compare or take away from the severity of the disorder spoken of in \nthe book, but to relate my own experiences to the stigmatization that was experienced. I was \nofficially diagnosed with OCD when I was 16 or 17, though I had always had a sense I may be \nsuffering from some form of mental disorder. I suffer from intrusive thoughts and compulsions. \nThese compulsions often involved touching objects with both hands to feel equal, avoiding \ncertain numbers, opening and closing things until it felt right, and so on. Needing a sense of \nrelief, I would often engage in these compulsions at work or school. Though I tried to be \n\nCaldwell 4 \ndiscreet, sometimes I would catch someone looking at me or asking, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d. \nWhen people caught me doing these things, I would feel very embarrassed and like I was \ndifferent from those around me. Though I knew what I was suffering from, I did not tell those \naround me my diagnosis of OCD, even when I was seen engaging in odd behavior. I was so \nfearful of how people would react or view me if I told them. The stigmatization surrounding \nmental disorders greatly affected my choice to refrain from telling people of my diagnosis. \nStigma, though I did not realize it at the time, made me extremely fearful to tell my parents what \nI was going through. I remember the night I broke down to my parents and confessed how much \nI was struggling with symptoms of OCD. I was terrified they\u2019d think I was weird or lying. Much \nlike Doug, I was met with nothing but complete support and love from my parents. Looking back \nnow, it\u2019s clear to me that the stigmatization that surrounds mental disorders is what made me so \nfearful of telling people. I had always known my parents to be loving and caring, yet the \nstigmatization of mental disorders had put fear in me that I would be met with rejection or \nthoughts that I was crazy. This thought came to me several times whilst reading the story, as I \nfelt many parallels in Doug's reluctance to tell people about his son's schizophrenia to my fear of \ntelling my loved ones about my OCD behaviors. \nBefore reading A Boy Broken, the limited knowledge I had of schizophrenia was shaped \nby fear and stereotypes. Reading and reflecting on this book has allowed me to see the \ndifficulties that affect an individual suffering from schizophrenia and those who love and care for \nthem. Through Doug\u2019s experiences, I learned what caring for an individual with schizophrenia \nlooks like and how stigma surrounding mental disorders creates fear and isolation for those \nsuffering and those caring for them. In connecting the book to my own experiences, I felt I was \nable to relate to the book and understand Doug\u2019s story.  \n \n \n\nCaldwell 5 \nReferences:  \nEngelman, D. J. (2023). A boy broken.

        "text": "Midterm Paper \nBy: Bryanna Yarborough \nSOC 345 - 001 \n \n \nIn this paper, I will share my views on marriage and how I think my views are similar and \ndifferent from others. I will also talk about how we all interpret marriage differently, then I will \ntalk about what this means for the overall society, and how we will look as a society in 2035. \n I am an oddball compared to most people in our class. My parents had me in high \nschool; they were together for a few years after I was born, and then my mom took me and her \nout of that environment. To sum it up, I came from teenage parents who were never married, and \nthey split when I was very young. My mom and I moved out, and she became a single mom. My \ndad wasn\u2019t super consistent in my life when I was young due to many reasons. Having gone \nthrough all of that has really impacted the way I feel about dating and how picky I need to be for \na husband. My mom and dad dated different people as I grew up; some were nice, some were not \nso nice. Seeing my mom being treated in abusive ways made me realize what I did not want in a \nrelationship or marriage. It made me feel as if marriage was going to be impossible for me, and I \nwas going to end up alone with a hundred cats. Growing up, I never had an ideal marriage in my \nhead, even in modern times, I don\u2019t because to me, families look different in so many ways. This \nclass has really gotten me thinking lately about my future with my boyfriend. Personally, I want \nto have a husband and 2-3 kids. I want my husband and me to both have jobs that we love and \nare passionate about, and I want us to have a balanced chore list instead of it all relying on me. \nMy boyfriend and I have been discussing marriage and how we feel like we are getting to that \npoint. The only reason why my boyfriend and I would be able to get to that point is because he is \nin the military. Financially, we would be supported, and we could live on base, so there aren\u2019t as \nmany barriers impacting us compared to others our age. I feel that currently there is a somewhat \n\nMidterm Paper \nBy: Bryanna Yarborough \nSOC 345 - 001 \n \nbalance of people my age getting married and then people my age not wanting to get married. I \nreally don\u2019t know where we are as a society when it comes to marriage and family because I see \nboth sides being represented pretty equally. Some of my friends have been in a relationship for \nyears, and they are at the point where they want to get engaged and married, but they also want \nto be financially stable before they take that step. Since divorce rates are higher, some people \nwant to have a nice, stable job that pays them enough in case they need to support themselves \nafter a divorce. I also have some friends who are not ready for marriage, but they live with their \nsignificant other. They figured that if they are always spending time at one place, then why both \npay for expensive apartments and not split the costs. Throughout this class, I started to think \nabout how the military might affect the statistics on marriage. I am around Marines a lot, and I \nhave seen some of them get married really young so they can have that extra financial support of \nBAH. It makes me wonder if military marriages are affecting the statistics in any way. There are \nsome people marrying their best friend in the military to get double BAH, and there are some \npeople getting married to someone they barely know. I wonder if this could affect the statistics of \nhow many same sex marriages are in the United States, and if this is making the divorce rate go \nup. I would really like to see research and the statistics on military marriages. Since, \nunfortunately, I am not able to predict the future due to my indecisiveness, I decided to look into \nwhat people are predicting the next few years will look like based on the research.  \n\u200b\nLooking at the Pew Research Center, I think the numbers will continue to decline. \nMore people are cohabitating, not having kids, etc. I think part of the cause for this is due to the \ncost of everything. If a couple can barely survive working two full-time jobs, then why would \nthey want to have kids? They would be in an even more financial burden with the cost of all of \n\nMidterm Paper \nBy: Bryanna Yarborough \nSOC 345 - 001 \n \nthe crazy things that babies need, hospital bills, and so much more. People are barely able to stay \nafloat as is, so they\u2019re not going to want to bring someone else into this world. I believe this is \nanother factor in why the divorce rates are increasing. People are supposed to be loving their \npartner, spending time with them, and being able to relax in their home. Instead, people are going \nfrom a stressful work environment to a stressful home environment, too. Their home \nenvironments could be stressful due to their partner not working, their home being a mess, or \neven because they simply can\u2019t pay their bills, even though they and their partner are working \nfull-time jobs. Looking at the Pew Research Center, it shows the statistics of families declining \nbut there are newer forms of families. For example, \u201cin 1970 67% of Americans ages 25 to 49 \nwere living with their spouse and one or more children younger than 18. Over the past five \ndecades, that share has dropped to 37%\u201d (Pew Research Center). The data also shows that 0.7% \nmarriages in 2015 were for same sex couples, but in 2021, that percentage went to 1.1%. \nThrough this center and their research also shows how the percentage of married with kids has \ndeclined, but the percentage for cohabitating with kids, unpartnered with kids, cohabitating no \nkids, and other family members has increased. All of these statistics show that even though \nmarriages have declined, the different forms of families have expanded. The acceptance of \ninterracial and same sex couples is becoming more accepted by people.  \nIn conclusion, I think the decline of marriage will keep going down because of financial \nburdens. If somehow we can fix our economy, then I think there will be an increase in marriages, \nbut for now, that number is still going to keep going down. In addition to that, I believe that the \ndifferent forms of families are going to keep increasing. I believe this will keep increasing \nbecause some of those family types are easier financially. Like I said above, many people I know \n\nMidterm Paper \nBy: Bryanna Yarborough \nSOC 345 - 001 \n \nlive with their significant other because rent and mortgages are very expensive nowadays. Other \nthings like your other bills, groceries, and gas are also very expensive. When the cost of those \nthings starts to decline, then in the future divorce rates will go back down and marriage rates will \ngo back up. A huge factor in divorces is usually related to money and being burnt out. If prices \ngo down, then it will create a less stressful home and work environment, which means that \nfamilies will most likely stay together rather than be stressed and give up. \n \n \nRefrences  \n \nArag\u00e3o, C., Parker, K., Greenwood, S., Baronavski, C., & Mandapat, J.
