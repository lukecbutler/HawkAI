Despite the advancements in equality, power, and position, women still face obstacles such as being valued based on their physical appearance and ability to become fertile. The stigma arose in the 1900s, when the Beauty Myth was prevalent. According to the author, Naomi Wolf, the beauty myth is not solely based on beauty, but also \u201cit is composed of emotional distance, politics, finance, and sexual repression\u201d (Wolf 1991). The beauty myth focused so much on women\u2019s appearance for advancement in gender hierarchy, not just for respect within the community, but also for political advancement. Men also faced social pressure to pursue a \u2018beautiful\u2019 woman to gain more political power. According to Wolf (1991), \u201cstrong men battle for beautiful women, and beautiful women are more reproductively successful.\u201d Essentially, men and women were both defined by women\u2019s beauty. \nAs we learned in class, the collective conscious is an unspoken, unwritten, set of rules and standards that society unknowingly follows. Each individual\u2019s collective conscious, during the beauty myth period, focused so evidently on beauty and appearance. There was so much pressure on both genders to be physically attractive. According to Wolf, \u201cmany [women] are ashamed to admit that such trivial concerns to do with physical appearance, bodies, faces, hair, clothes \u2013 matter so much\u201d (1991). Even though women are becoming more powerful within society, their collective conscious will always remind them that there is an unspoken expectation to be beautiful. Insecurities, mental illnesses, and even health issues became more extensive to women. There was a high standard to fit in with society for women, and women worked hard to be within these irrational standards. \n\tDid you know that \u201cMore than 1 million American teenagers and preteens live with an\u00a0eating\u00a0disorder\u2014about 3 percent of that population\u201d (Cooperman 2009)? Currently, in the United States, eating disorders have become increasingly popular. Interestingly enough, it is more common in women than in men. So, is it possible that the beauty myth from the 1900s, that focused so highly on women\u2019s physical attraction for political advancement acted as a precursor to current eating disorders? \nWhat is the Beauty Myth? \n\tNaomi Wolf, author of \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d, discusses the importance of the beauty myth stigma and defines the political movement. As women socially and politically advance within society, Wolf elucidates the decline in mental health. Women in society were constantly being compared to old photographs of what society considered beautiful women. In order to meet society\u2019s expectations, women were constantly focusing on their exterior. How women portrayed themselves to society was crucial for political advancement for both themselves and for the men in society. There were unspoken expectations for men to pursue beautiful women in order to become more politically powerful. How each gender was perceived by society mattered. These irrational standards for physical attraction increased numerous kinds of mental illnesses and, more importantly, eating disorders. \n\tAccording to Wolf, \u201cDuring the past decade, women breached the power; meanwhile, eating disorders rose exponentially and cosmetic surgery became the fastest growing medical specialty\u201d (1991). During the rise of feminism and the fight for equality, women believed that a necessity that contributes to political power was to be beautiful. Back then, women were constantly forced to look at photographs of provocative, thin women. Because of the beauty stigma, women constantly would strive to look just like these provocative women. It was important to have a youthful face, but not too youthful, and to be skinny. It was just as important to dress up appropriately to society\u2019s standards. Women were defined not only by physical looks, but also by the clothing that they chose to wear. Women\u2019s body shape should be the same as the women in the photographs, which led to unnecessary dieting. The pressure for women to appropriately portray themselves to society was uncanny and unfair. Women were vulnerable to outside approval which, in turn, consequently led to self-esteem issues, mental disorders, and most importantly eating disorders. \nWhat is an Eating Disorder?\n What exactly is an eating disorder? An eating disorder can be defined as \u201c...medically and psychiatrically recognized illnesses...they are complex conditions involving mental, physical, and social issues\u201d (Cooperman 2009). An eating disorder is serious and potentially fatal. Eating disorders are so important to understand because they encompass both unhealthy eating behaviors and also mental illnesses. In order to be diagnosed with an eating disorder, the individual must have serious disturbances in their eating behavior. This can include an extreme or unhealthy reduction of food intake, severe over-eating, or feelings of distress or extreme concern about body shape or weight (Cooperman 2009). \nEating disorders begin when an individual is unhappy with their appearance. There are numerous types of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Each disorder is serious and can become fatal because of the biological and physical detrimental effects.  For example, anorexia nervosa is the most prevalent eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa includes feelings of low self-esteem, lack of eating, and an intense fear of gaining weight. Due to this fear of gaining weight, individuals are usually below the healthy body mass index average. Body Mass Index (B.M.I) is defined by the person\u2019s weight in comparison to their height. Unfortunately, being below the BMI average indicates lack of healthy eating and lack of healthy physical involvement. Without proper eating styles, the individual will lack the proper nutrients that enable the body to function properly. Without appropriate physical activity, the individual will lack metabolic movement, and the body will become slower in almost every anatomical aspect. The second most common eating disorder is bulimia nervosa. This eating disorder isn\u2019t as serious as anorexia nervosa, but it still can become unhealthy. Bulimia Nervosa can be triggered by life\u2019s stressors. An individual with bulimia nervosa will binge-eat for an unhealthy period of time, and then later, want to reverse the effects of eating too much. This individual will purge the calories that they just ate by either self-inducing vomit or by excess exercise. This purging stage can become dangerous for the individual but is a hard action to treat due to the positive emotional effects that the reversal can have on the individual. The individual will have these positive emotions because they feel proud that they reversed the caloric gain. An individual with bulimia nervosa likes feeling in control of their purge making this disorder hard to treat. (Cooperman 2009) \nLastly, the third most common eating disorder is binge-eating. Unlike the other two disorders, binge-eating does not correlate with weight-loss. These individuals will eat an excessive amount but will not purge their weight. Interestingly, despite the individual\u2019s lack of reversal of the caloric intake, these individuals will still have low self-esteem. Each eating disorder has one thing in common and that is low self-esteem and / or poor image issues. Statistically, women are more prone to eating disorders than men. So, did the beauty myth stigma leave such a detrimental impact that still effects millions of women today? \nBeauty Myth and Eating disorders\n \tDid you know that at least, approximately, 7 million women are diagnosed with an eating disorder (Kramer 2021)? During the beauty myth stigma time period, women constantly compare themselves to photogprahs of what society considers beautiful. Women strive to look just like the provocative women in these photographs. Similarily, to this day, women are still constantly comparing themselves to photogprahs of models. This has become more evident in shopping centers. When women shop at malls or clothing stores, or even beauty counters, they are constatnly faced with beauty selections for specifically youthful women. In both generations, it has been important for women to have a youthful face and to be skinny. For example, clothing stores are oriented for skinnier women because sizing is emphasized in shopping centers. In beauty counters, the \u2018in-style\u2019 look is to be youthful, to cover-up any flaws. Do these expectations for women to fit into these unrealistic standards of beauty correlate with the high statistic of women with eating disorders?\n\tDid you know that \u201capproximatey 0.5 percent to 1 percent of young women will suffer from anorexia...?\u201d (Kramer 2021). Anorexia is the lack of self-esteem, fear of gaining weight, and insufficent food intake. Anorexia emphasizes insecurities about the woman\u2019s body figure. Anorexia can be correlated with the idea that girls and women need to be beautiful. Society\u2019s idea of beautiful involves the expectation to be skinny. Individuals with anorexia may try to fit in by purging caloric intake and by avoiding proper nutrients just to fit in with society\u2019s expecations. In concldusion, as Kramer discusses in her article, \u201cthe empahsis in American society on physical beauty, thinnness, dieting, and exercise plays a role in the prevlance of eating disorders...\u201d (2021). \n\tThere are too many irrational expecations placed upon women. Women are not only facing inequality in social injustice, but also facing judgements based on physical appearance. Women suffer from eating disorders because of society\u2019s standards of beauty. Just because women are politically more powerful than they were centuries ago, women are still struggling with mental illnesses and eating disorders. These illnesses are crucial because they can become fatal. The collective conscious of each society has an unjust, unfair, high standard for women to be beautiful in order to fit in with soicety. These societal pressures lead to these illnesses, so it is important to spread awareness about eating disorders before it becomes too late. Early intervention, such as therapy, is one of the best practices to prevent eating disorders from becoming suicidal or unhealthy. Not only does therapy prevent suicide, but it will also help build self-esteem and confidence in women. Moreoever, it is important to not ignore the constant pressure that women face politically, physically, and internally. ",

        "text": "Mallory Cieutat\nSociology 105\n18 October 2021\n\nSociety Shaping Slut-Shaming\nSlaps on the back, fist pumps in the air, cheering, and hair ruffling. This is the exact reaction I have seen time and time again when a male walks in the room from a suggested sexual encounter. However, women lose girl friends, and make plenty of new guy friends, thanks to their new title as a \u201cwhore\u201d. The morning after is comical for men, yet embarrassing, and creates feelings of guilt for women. Society celebrates men, but criticizes women, for the same sexual encounters because of the construct of gender roles, defined by the collective consciousness, and the role of anatomy in performing these roles.\nCountless examples come to mind when considering this argument. I recently walked into a room with a guy, whom we will refer to as Kevin, from a late dinner on campus, but the image of us walking in together created a different idea. All of Kevin\u2019s friends, particularly his roommate, were extremely excited. They exemplified the previously stated symptoms of celebration - the fist pumps and \u201cahhh I see you\u2019s\u201d. Watching this unfold, my face reddened from embarrassment, even though I knew that nothing had happened. \nThroughout the entire night, every time Kevin made his way to specifically talk to me, or touch me on the arm, or make any sort of \u201cmove\u201d, cheers from the other men began. However, not a single girl spoke to me the rest of the night. I had officially won the unwanted title. I was made to feel guilty and outcast for something I did not even pursue. This is one of many, many similar experiences I have encountered in my relatively short lifespan.\nAdditionally, I have heard the gossip and the truth to many comparable experiences. Just a few nights ago, a girl, whom we will refer to as Carla, sent a photo of her and a guy to my dorm\u2019s group chat. Only about half of their faces were visible, but because of the messiness of Carla\u2019s hair, it was immediately assumed they \u201chooked up\u201d. This girl had recently moved into our dorm, and only a few nights into meeting new people, she was automatically labeled a whore. Her ability to make her own positive impression disappeared. \nI was in the room with most of the people in the group chat, and the guys were shocked, impressed, yet also disgusted with her behavior. \u201cDamn, he got with Carla?\u201d was asked repeatedly. Her sexuality was discussed, and decided to be readily available and unwanted. Many of the women listening to the debate were just as disgusted as the men by her assumed actions, however, my roommate and I happen to be friends with Carla. My roommate reached out to her and told her what was being discussed. Carla was, understandably, extremely upset. She responded, explaining that she hadn\u2019t even kissed the guy. Similar to my experience, Carla was made to feel guilty and outcast for something she had not even done.\nWhile sex is assigned at birth, gender is a societal construction dictating how the male versus female should behave. Everyone is expected to \u201cdo gender\u201d by conforming to their assigned, socially learned set of acceptable behaviors. This set of actions is created by the collective consciousness - a system in which the population creates a set of uniform ideals and standards based on overarching values, experiences, and practices. \u201cDoing gender\u201d is following these standards, and can be exemplified by women wearing longer hair and shorter shorts, while men do the opposite. Men \u201cdo gender\u201d by acting tough and strong, while women submit to their dominance. Gender is an achieved status, in which one can become successful or fail, depending on the way each individual chooses to behave (West & Zimmerman). Our ability to perform these expected actions is specifically dictated by our physical bodies.\nEach gender has been defined to have a specific body for a specific purpose. The male\u2019s body is viewed as a direct and normal link to the world. However, for centuries, women have been seen as imprisoned, or held captive, by their bodies. Supposedly, women only think with their hormones, are held back by their ovaries and uterus, and are seen as incomplete. The woman is viewed only as a sexed being. The collective consciousness has defined a woman's purpose to make use of these hormones and internal organs and find a partner to complete them. Men, however, have been defined as perfectly complete by themselves, with the ability to think rationally and make decisions free of anatomical inhibition. Both men and women have hormones, yet our society has created the idea that women are completely dictated by these hormones, while men are completely unaffected (de Beauvoir).\nThis idea is also related to the toxic institution of hegemonic masculinity. This cultural practice legitimizes men\u2019s dominance in society by celebrating the male gender role. Men are defined as strong, competitive, initiative-taking providers. The practice of these roles hurls men up the world\u2019s socio-economic ladder, with new job opportunities and respected reputations. The beneficial outcome reestablishes the idea that men are the dominant, successful gender, and encourages men to continue being strong and independent (Stroudt).\nBecause the male is defined by strength and independence, sexual encounters are seen as an active choice. In other words, men can control their emotions and passions and reactivate these drives when they want to. They are celebrated for being strong, for leading the act with a level head, and for being independent. However, dictated by their hormones, women are viewed as \u201cout of control\u201d when acting on their emotions and participating in sexual behaviors. De Beauvoir\u2019s exploration of the difference in purposes of the male and female body explains the expected actions and reactions of \u201cthe act\u201d.\n\tAdditionally, the idea that men supposedly control themselves, and consciously, actively engage in sexual activity reestablishes the idea that they are mentally, emotionally, and physically strong, and are dominant because of their self-control. This cycle furthers the institution of hegemonic masculinity, and thus furthers the idea that women need support and are too mentally weak to fight their emotions. The guilt and embarrassment women feel when accused of a sexual encounter stems from this idea. Women feel like they have done something wrong, that they should have been stronger, should have controlled themselves differently, should have presented themselves better, even when they did not participate in anything at all. \n\tMen are celebrated, while women are criticized, for the exact same sexual actions, or even assumed sexual actions, in the exact same context. Sexual encounters reestablish men\u2019s strength, independence, and dominance defined by their gender role. Becoming successful in this role grants men overall respect, and countless opportunities in the \u201creal world\u201d. This celebrated dominance instantly labels women as \u201cthe other\u201d and treats half of the population as a weaker minority. \nAs our society begins to shift to accept \u201cgirl-bosses\u201d and female empowerment, it becomes even more embarrassing and frustrating for \u201cslutty\u201d actions to be assumed. Women desire to be respected, to be accepted for who they are, and to be viewed as controlled, intentional beings, who are more than just a sexed body. The assumptions that women are \u201ctoo eager\u201d, have \u201clet their guard down\u201d, have \u201clost control\u201d, or just don\u2019t have a desire for a sexual partner to \u201ccomplete them\u201d, invalidates the real emotions and intelligence hiding behind the hyperfocus on women\u2019s hormones and uterus. In order to continue progression into a more equal and just world, we have to begin recognizing that men and women can both cultivate self-control, and both deserve respect, not punishment.",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n28 April 2021 \nInequalities in the Mental Health Care System \n\tMental health is extremely significant in American society as it constitutes part of an individual's identity. Although there is a consensus that mental health is very important, many groups in society have considerable barriers to accessing comprehensive health care. This begs the question: If mental health is so crucial to our society, why doesn\u2019t everyone have equal access to it? According to Community of Hearts, an advocacy for the importance of mental health care, \u201c1 in 4 people live with a mental health issue\u201d (Community of Hearts). However, not all people who suffer with their mental health get appropriate care, especially minorities in America. This paper identifies how the mental health stigma, an individual's culture, and lack of resources discriminate in the mental health care system and create barriers to equitable access to proper care for minorities compared to non-Latino whites. \nIn The Matrix of Domination, Patricia Hill Collins depicts how African American women have a perspective that should be utilized by society to advocate for change. By using an oppressed groups perspective, institutions are able to assess what needs to be changed to create a more inclusive mental health care system. The Matrix of Domination will be addressed throughout the paper to show that by focusing on oppressed groups, the American mental health care system can give minorities the accessibility and attention they deserve. \n\tThe stigma of mental health leads to a lack of people getting help for their mental illness because the stigma creates an illusion that it is something to be embarrassed about. Some people even feel like it is something you can\u2019t talk about without negative repercussions.  Factors of these repercussions could be judgment from society, how they feel about getting help, and how their family and friends view mental health care. For example, an individual may be more hesitant to address their problems to a family member or friend on account of the backlash they might receive. The stigma can have extremely detrimental effects on an individual, as it prevents them from getting the help they need. A 2017 study by the APA proved, \u201cgreater self-stigma was associated with poorer recovery from mental illnesses after one and two years\u201d (American Psychiatric Association). What this study by the APA indicates is that less people are getting the help they need as a result of the stigma associated with mental health harming your identity. Some effects of this harmful stigma can be strains on relationships, a negative self attitude, withdrawal from beloved activities, and so much more. Furthermore, the data shows that attributing a negative connotation to getting help for a mental illness is actively contributing to making the individual\u2019s mental health worse. \n\tDue to the negative connotation of receiving care for your mental health, groups in America fear the judgment of the public. These groups already receive judgment in the United States due to their race and culture, why would they want more? Throughout United States history, minorities in American have been segregated from non-Latino whites and stripped of respect. Fear is prevalent in their lives as they have to fight for equality every single day. Wiley Online Library states, \u201cThe fear of experiencing double discrimination- from mental illness and from being black- was a significant barrier to care\u201d (Alang). The double discrimination expressed by Alang indicates how African Americans are scared that they will have one more thing to be discriminated against. The persistent discrimination against minorities in America for decades has instilled fear in them that the discrimination has the potential to get even more severe. \n\tA lack of understanding for one\u2019s culture has also constructed a barrier in certain groups in America from receiving proper mental health care. Cultures all have different rituals, narratives, and artifacts that form them, which are called collective representations. These factors can influence racial/ethnic groups not to seek help. According to Sage Journals, \u201cVariation in cultural orientations, adherence to social norms, and location in the system may generate variation in self-labeling across racial/ethnic groups\u201d (Villatoro). Villatoro describes in the Sage Journals article that certain groups will restrain from seeking help for a mental illness due to the beliefs their culture has instilled in them. For example, The American Psychiatric Association states, \u201cin some Asian cultures, seeking professional help for mental illness may counter cultural beliefs of a strong family, emotional restraint, and avoiding shame\u201d (American Psychiatric Association). The assertion made by The American Psychiatric Association illustrates that some Asian Americans are not willing to get help due to the collective representations their culture has embedded in them, such as it being shameful to seek help. Cultures around America differ in their beliefs and the way they carry themselves, which can influence their stance on whether they seek help for their mental health. \n\tAlongside cultural barriers, If an individual cannot find someone proficient in their language for their mental health needs, it can create a barrier from receiving proper help as well. Language allows individuals and groups to communicate with one another in a plethora of ways; however, individuals speaking different languages can cause misunderstanding and affect the conversation immensely in a negative way. According to Psychiatry Online, \u201cprevious studies have shown that psychiatric patients with limited English proficiency underutilized specialist outpatient services and that those who did receive such services were less likely to participate in psychotherapy than fluent English speakers\u201d (Alegria). The Psychiatry Online quote describes the difficulty those who do not speak English have in finding proper mental health care. Non-English speaking individuals have a hard time trying to navigate how to get help when they can\u2019t engage in a conversation about their needs. \n\tThe lack of respect in American institutions towards minorities has caused oppressed groups to avoid seeking help from them, which reduces the resources available to them. According to the American Psychiatric Association, \u201conly one-in-three African Americans who need mental health care receive it\u201d (American Psychiatric Association). The policies, regulations and employment positions in American institutions have left oppressed groups feeling under-represented and unheard which alter their appeal to mental health care treatment. The Wiley Online Library conducted a study which showed an immense lack of trust in United States institutions from minorities. The study conveyed how \u201cblack people have gone into the mental health care system to get help, but have lost things that are important to them\u201d (Alang). The conclusion made by the study shows how mistreatment in American systems has made oppressed people frightened to go back to them. In other words, the fear instilled in minorities due to oppression in American institutions is drastically reducing their urge to get the help they need. \n\tResources are a vital aspect to acquiring proper care for an individual\u2019s mental health. The link discovered between race and availability to resources proved to stagger the opportunity of getting proficient help. Villatoro states,\u201cthe benefits of educational and economical resources for the identification of need for treatment and its response may not extend to racial/ethnic minority populations in the same way it benefits non-Latino whites\u201d (Villatoro). Villatoro is concluding the benefits non-Latino whites have in accessing resources and being able to use them proficiently. Resources may conclude facilities and programs embedded in the community to connect people with information on how to seek help. The resources in your community allow easier access for help, but what if there is none? According to the Psychiatry Service article, \u201cresearch has found that the more behavioral health specialists there are in a community, the more likely individuals are to use these services\u201d (Alegria). The research states in the previous article that this is often seen with marginalized races or ethnicity, as well as within those experiencing poverty or homelessness. Non-Latino whites have an advantage over other races/ethnicity who do not commonly have the access to those crucial resources. \n\tThe sources throughout this essay conclude Collins' discussion in The Matrix of Domination on how oppressed people in our society have a beneficial perspective that should be looked at. When white men are the focus point of so many US institutions, the institutions are listening to the group that is the least oppressed in America. A black resident took note of this in the Wiley Online Library article by stating, \u201cif the board of directors are all white, they should be asking themselves why\u201d (Alang).  This retort suggests a reexamining of the people in charge of making the policies. When the least oppressed group is controlling the situations, it allows for unfair treatment towards minorities to be suggested. \nFor Collins, African American women show a perspective that can illustrate where in the system inequalities are shown between minorities and non-Latino whites. By looking at this perspective, institutions can contribute to decreasing the stigma in communities. Decreasing stigma in communities can be attributed to evaluating where the stigma is stemming from and how the oppressed groups think it can be nurtured. The knowledge obtained from these groups when creating new policies and regulations in the mental health institutions is crucial for reducing the stigma in communities. \nDiscussing an oppressed group's culture from their point of view allows a universal understanding of their needs. Not everyone will accept different cultures, but it is important to get members of mental health institutions to understand where their clients are coming from and how to help them to the best of their knowledge. The oppressed groups' knowledge is obtained from personal experience and is a direct correlation of how their culture has impacted them. Educating others on a culture has to come from an individual in that culture because those who are not oppressed cannot fully comprehend what it is like for them. \nMental health care institutions can assess where they need more mental health care resources by attributing Collins theory. Primarily focusing on oppressed groups and services they lack, will lead to an increasing number of the population receiving proper mental health care. Collins summarizes the importance of community oppressed groups, such as African Americans, have sparked. Communities built by oppressed groups provide strength in fighting injustices. The communities need accessible resources for mental health that allow them to use their strength to help others and themselves. \n\t Learning from the current issues, such as the stigma, culture barriers, and lack of resources, we can ensure that the prominence of discrimination in our system can change for the better. Change can be attributed by placing those who are oppressed in the center of focus, so mental health institutions can identify factors that are wrong with the system. Mental health affects individuals everyday life and it is crucial to ensure proper care for it is taking place. In American society, individuals and systems need to influence change on expanding accessibility of mental health care resources. This change will not be an easy one; however, with reduction to the mental health stigma, cultural understanding, and proper allocation of resources, a definite improvement can be achieved in American society with equitable access for all. \n\nWorks Cited\n\nAlang, Sirry M. \u201cMental Health Care Among Blacks in America: Confronting Racism and Constructing Solutions .\u201d Health Service Research , Wiley Online Library , 27 Jan. 2019, onlinelibrary-wiley-com.liblink.uncw.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.13115. \nAlegria, Margarita, and Glorisa Canino. \u201cMental Health Care for Latinos: Inequalities Is Use of Specialty Mental Health Services among Latinos, African Americans, and Non-Latinos Whites.\u201d Psychiatry Services , American Psychiatric Association , 1 Dec. 2002, ps-psychiatryonline-org.liblink.uncw.edu/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547. \n\u201cMental Health Advocacy .\u201d Community of Hearts, www.communityofhearts.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnJyaDULUj2lNe8fLN6fPfpqeTdvYLnrK3DeDVlQ1LgThCaVYmGYHU8aAsBKEALw_wcB.  \nStigma, Prejudice, and Discrimination Against People with Mental Illnesses .

        "text": "Sociology 105\n29 November 2021\n\nThe Role of the Collective Consciousness in Religious Discrepancies\n\u00c9mile Durkheim, a renowned French sociologist, explored the societal dispositions caused by collective thought. By first defining collective representation as a symbol, artifact, or narrative that embodies collective belief, Durkheim had a reasonable explanation for the objective unification of a society. For example, America is united by the symbol of the American flag, and Christians are united by various Christmas traditions. Durkheim, however, still had to do some research into the effects of collective representation on the individual. \nShortly afterwards, Durkheim discovered the related concept of collective consciousness. The collective consciousness is essentially the shared and intertwined sense of reality we all experience because of shared collective representations. Its purpose is to provide universal truths and values we can all understand, accept, and follow as individuals. Individuals collectively fabricated our society with the help of collective representations, thus creating a collective consciousness, in order to justify our own daily thoughts and actions. Traditions and objects were created and celebrated so that humans had a sense of meaning and a sense of unity. These traditions and objects, over generations, invented a collective mindset we all today share. For example, the tradition of gift-giving at Christmas time began as a way to pay respect to and honor the three kings that brought gifts to Jesus Christ. It gave citizens a sense of meaning and purpose, and brought the society together in humility and gratitude. After becoming a tradition, or norm, the act brought people together in likemindedness. The action of exchanging presents brought people together physically, and was then followed by a mental and emotional unification. The collective consciousness was formed thanks to collective representation. The mindset was created because of the accepted \u201cobject\u201d.\nYuval Noah Harari, an Israeli historian and author, explored the related topic of the 2 versions of God. The first God is the \u201ccosmic mystery\u201d, the God that makes us ponder the purpose of life and the mysteries of the world. This God is the mystic aura that explains the deepest riddles of the universe. The first God is pretty much universally agreed upon and accepted. Many believe that there is some greater force, a greater being that knows all and watches over all. Though it may be vague, it is still an idea that universally connects our society.\nThe second God is the \u201cworldly lawgiver\u201d. This is the God that blurts out rules about dress, language, diet, appearance, sexual behavior, daily conduct, etc. This God is more controversial, more disagreed upon. In fact, this second God is what split up the Christian religion into dozens of denominations, creating rivalries and even hatreds of opposing groups. The first God is more of a general belief, while the second God creates daily rituals and practices. In reality, the two have no logical correlation. For example: why do the mysteries of the universe determine what length of dress a woman can wear? However, followers use various holy books that teach rituals and food taboos to justify the connection. \nMost people began with a general belief in a greater force, or higher being. But thanks to newly instituted (at least in the span of time) religious rituals, or collective representations, the mindset, or collective consciousness, has thus shifted. We, as humans, long to be a part of something bigger. We need a purpose, a higher reason, and we want to feel supported in it. We seek unity. Therefore, overtime, different groups have instituted different practices in order to coordinate our social lives. The shared goal to discover more about the \u201cgreater force\u201d causes us to create shared plans, practices, etc. But obviously, sometimes people disagree. Different groups stuck together on different topics, and a variety of different religions were born. Even those basic religions broke off several more times to create different branches and denominations. As time goes on, more groups are created. Objects and habits, such as the Bible and its teachings, were created as physical structures to glue the institutions together. The Bible is an example of a collective representation. The variety of representations created, such as the Bible, the Tipitaka, the Quran and the Hadiths, and the Tanakh and the Talmud, paved the way for dozens of new mindsets, or collective consiousnesses, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism.\nIn other words, collective representation is to scripture as collective consciousness is to religion. The second God that Harari describes creates these divisions as new symbolic objects and belief systems integrate themselves into the world. The more divisions created in scripture and teachings, the more extreme the different collective consciousnesses become. The mindset of religion, defined as the first God, or collective consciousness, is formed thanks to collective representation, or the object of scripture or worship. The first God was originally a much broader topic, but as generations have instituted and accepted new collective representations, the first God has been redefined. There are now many new versions of this first God, based on any given specific belief system, which is why we now see so much rivalry and competition in religion rather than worship. In the effort to uncover truths and individual value systems, we have forgotten the basic, shared foundation in our first God. \nIn order to recultivate our shared curiosity and love for the greater forces in the universe, and unify ourselves once again in vague belief, we must reevaluate the importance we place upon our various collective representations. Is it more important that we feel justified in our dress length and word usage, or that we are a unified society? At the very least, we should take just a few steps back, far enough where we can be civil, become educated about, and respect specific religions. Just as bloodshed is never the answer, convention will never bring peace. Rather than pushing practices onto people, we as a society should celebrate and worship the greater forces together and unite in the common goal for the betterment of society. ",

Men's mental health is becoming increasingly stigmatized, according to societal norms, religious, and cultural views. Hegemonic masculinity is a term used to describe this phenomenon. Hegemonic masculinity is a means for a society to force men to fit into the mold they desire. Telling them that they cannot express emotion, that they must be powerful and aggressive, and that they must adhere to these rules in order to be \u201ccool and popular\u201d. Hegemonic masculinity is a toxic mold in our culture that must be acknowledged, and the community must work to change for the welfare of all.\n\tHegemonic masculinity is often everywhere in a growing boy and adult man's life. Yet, why and how do societal standards within military or leadership schools effect the development of young men? The most prominent area to affect growing boys, however, is schools. As boys develop and get older, they are pushed into a system that will change who they are. They need to play sports and be muscular, wear cool clothes and have a kind personality but not too kind. \n\tIn today's society, hegemonic masculinity has been demonstrated in a variety of texts and other ways. In the text \"You're either in or out,\" the author discusses how hegemonic masculinity impacts young boys in a private school setting. The boys are bound to a societal hegemonic masculinity structure. \"Obviously [you're]... the coolest man ever if you're dating the lead cheerleader in a coed school, but... because there are no girls, that's simply one less way for guys to... prove themselves, so they have to find other methods\" ( pg.275). The passage also mentions how the guys are shamed for expressing emotion and are always competing with one another. Though the teachers and adults are very satisfied with the boys' behavior, they earn high grades, which helps them get into excellent schools; their athletics are above and beyond typical standards, and the teachers believe it makes them feel more connected to the boys. While the hegemonic masculinity system pushes boys further in life and everyone around them admires how they act, the system's impact on the boy as an individual is negative. The guys will grow up believing that they must prove themselves in various ways, such as having the newest automobile, the prettiest woman, being the best athlete, or owning the largest home. However, their brains are conditioned to believe that human emotions are unacceptable and that a guy must constantly be put together and provide for others in order to be a man.\n\"Bias\" is defined as \"prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group when compared to another, usually in an unjust fashion\" (oxford languages). Negativity bias explains why bad events have a greater psychological influence. This could explain why it's so difficult to get past \"initial impressions.\" This explains why we recall negative experiences more easily than good recollections, and why trauma flashbacks are more common than joyful flashbacks. This bias can be acquired throughout one's life; it can be forced on people by societal standards or incorporated into one's childhood to make one believe that this is how things should be. A negative bias is commonly created in many schools where hegemonic masculinity impacts growing boys. This would be a voice in the boys' brains asking them to do better in this or that so that they can outperform other males, and if they don't, the negativity bias would focus on that moment and they will believe they are not good enough.\nFor high school, I went to a private boarding school where the boys were in the military and the ladies were in leadership. I am more passionate about the topic of why hegemonic masculinity is wrong and negatively effects guys now that I've witnessed it myself. When boys first arrive at Culver, they go through a process known as \"new cadet,\" in which they must clean and memorize \"common knowledge\" about the school in order to pass boards at the end. Board is a three-day test in which they must have a spotless room and be able to answer difficult common knowledge questions at random while being shouted at. New cadets are treated with contempt and ridiculed until they pass. Whenever you go to Culver, you see the bright young males go in on orientation day and almost completely transform into a new person. You wouldn't recognize them if you saw them from their first day of high school to their last. You see kids participate in sports and you see everything about who they disappear and they become a whole new person. While they do excel in academics and athletics the personal effect on the boys is negative. \n30% of men between the ages of 18-24 suffer from mental health issues, the percentages are only going up as age goes up. Mental health is a growin probelm throughout the world and becoming a very publzied and prominent issue. Many organization and people are focusing on overcoming this problem and working to help people through their mental health issues. Something our society often ofrgets about though is menal halt problems effect men also and not only women. While there is not as large of a group of men with mental health problems as there is women there is alot of people that still need help. Many times men will nto reach out foe help because they do not want to be seen as weak and not \u201cmanly\u201d enough. Society has created such a stigma around emotions for men and that they should not cry and more. Hegmonic masculinity is to blame for many mental health problems. Men feeling like they have to do certain things or they will be critzied and ridiculed, feeling like they can never show emotion, must provide for others and be strong and athletic, love sports and outdoors. This negatively effects the mental health of men heavily. They go from being care free and living life however they want to living life inside a world of standards and conformitys they must fit into. This is why hegemonic masculinity negatively effects men in such a bad way, especially in growing boys because their brains are still malleable and when this is pushed onto them it is just what they assume is normal. \nHegemonic masculinity has transformed what it means to be a man over history, but many aspects have remained the same. Despite the changes and chances that come, hegemonic masculinity continues to have a negative impact on men's mental health. Growing boys' mental health deteriorates whenever they are exposed to rigorous societal expectations, whether they show it or not. They are pressured to meet societal standards in order to gain status in their schooling system and in life; they try to be viewed as cool and popular and to be better than everyone else.

Many women in the world are treated different and have different expectations upon them. They might be told that they only need to do 20 pushups, while a man has to do 40 pushups, or that woman have to be the cook in the family.  These expectations show the opposing views that are placed on men and women throughout the globe. For example, in many countries, especially the Middle East, women are talked down to, as to say that she deserves the same treatment as a dog. At the same time, men are treated as they are superior and deserve to have more respect. So, why are women treated with less respect than men are? Are women not as deserving of the same respect as men in society? \nIn dealing with the complexity of the roles of men and woman in the world, we have to take a look at what how society view this. Society believes this to be the norm. There are certain unwritten rules that people follow, so everyone can calmly follow their role in life. But are these roles starting to change as the world becomes more modern?  People are starting to do different tasks because of modernization and more acceptance with others.\nTo take it back to better understand the changes that we are seeing now in the modern world, let us take a look to what it was like in the early 1900s. In the early 1900s though, the roles between the two genders had not changed. The roles were always the men worked and the women would stay home. Women were expected to help take care of the children, cook all the meals, and clean the house. This was their \u201cjob.\u201d  They were not allowed outside of the home, like in today\u2019s societies. You never saw a woman out of the house doing something besides her job of being a mother. As the years went on, women started gaining more rights. They started to change the history. The first time the world saw this change was in the 1920s. The 1920s was when women were able to fight for their voting right and gained the right to participate in elections. This was just the beginning the women\u2019s movement. As one can see, women starting fighting for more freedom and demanding more change. This change started to be seen in the movies and shows that were produced. It showed the gender roles being flipped from what they had been where women went to work and the man would stay home. \nThis change in the roles of men and women are now prevalently seen in the modern world. I have watched the different roles in life change. One thing I have observed is fathers are staying home more, while the women are going out to make the money. There are different reasons why this might be. It might be better financially better for the family or it might just suit the family dynamic better this way. My family has not experienced this, but I recently watched a movie The Interns that speaks to this situation. The two characters that are in this are Jules, the mom, and Matt, the father. Jules recently started up her company called \u201cAbout the Fit,\u201d which is an online fashion website. Since the company is such a big hit, Matt stayed home to help take care of their daughter, Paige. He helped take Paige to school, birthday parties, had tea time with her, and so much more to be there for their daughter. \nThe Intern shows how the roles of men and women are depicted differently than how society had demonstrated them to be. In society, the mom is typically the one that stays at home but for this family, it made since for the dad to stay home to watch the daughter. This is one of example of how peoples gender roles are changing. \nAnother example this is the show Full House. This show is about Danny Tanner (the dad) and how he raises his three daughters. He has help from his brother-in-law, Joey Gladstone and Uncle Jesse watches the daughters as well. This shows was filmed in the early 90s, so it marked the beginning where we started seeing men stay at home. \nEven though roles have significantly changed as seen in the show, there is another problem that women are faced with. Women are judged everyday for their physical appearance by men and society, in general. They are expected to look perfect. Their body size must be small. This view of women makes women out to be less important and only fit just to reproduce. \nIt is made to seem that women\u2019s only contribution to society is just for reproductive purposes only. And, it also underlines the myth that beauty is subjective to the end. Thus, we can see that women have made quite a progression in certain areas, while in other areas, things have not changed at all. \nThe same thing can be seen in the workplace. Men and women\u2019s salaries are not always equal. Men are usually always paid more than women are for doing the same job. This has given men more advantages. They do not have to prove their worth to the boss or to society as a whole in the same way that women do. Men can more easily get a job and do not have to go through the same inspection of the interview process to prove that they are qualified to have the job. It has created an unequal divide regarding the paychecks, occupations, and how the views of the genders are changing. \nAnother issue that we have seen in society is the LGBTQ+ society. This is an issue as the genders are not given the same rights. They also have to fight for the rights that are given to other individuals. This can be seen in a worldly fashion. LGBTQ+ in many parts of the world are being punished for what they believe to be who they are and what they deserve. An example of how mistreated LGBTQ+ people are in the world. Let us take a look at what happens in the Middle East for being gay. In Middle East, they are killed for being who they are. Just like women are. Both groups of people are being scrutinized for being who they are. \nThese examples of my own personal family dynamics, the movie, The Interns, and Full House, and other examples have demonstrated how the family roles have changed over the years. The women\u2019s movements from the early 1900s to modern day reflects how much progression and change we have gone through as a society. Women are able to participate in virtually every aspect of society and do not have to just be a stay-at-home mom. This fight for women\u2019s rights can also be seen in the LGBTQ+ group fighting for their rights. Even though women and the LGBTQ+ have attained many more freedoms, we are still seeing a constant battle to equal out the playing field among the two genders and LGBTQ+. \n\n\n850: 9829\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105\n\nThe spread of McDonaldization in society\n\tDespite its name, the theory of McDonaldization actually spread in to a variety of other industries other than just fast food. Industries like banking, news papers, grocery shopping, schooling have all started to implement the ideals of McDonalization into their businesses. With each new generation we seem to be growing more and more impatient as a society with the expectation of instant satisfaction being at an all time high. The continuous evolution of the tech industry has become the biggest driving factor in all this as things like streaming services, online shopping, and social media continuing to fill our need for instant gratification. And in a world with 7 billion people and counting who expect all tasks to be performed with near perfect execution the theory of McDonalization has flourished. \n\tGrowing up there are very few sights that are more beloved than that of seeing two golden arches in the horizon while on a long road trip. Its the most gourmet meal you have ever had, the pinnacle of all restaurants, your yelling and pleading becomes more intense the closer you get, with the exit nearing you can almost taste those golden French fries, only to have your heart broken by your parents passing it by uttering the most heart breaking phrase \u201cwe have food at home\u201d. While there were fast food restaurants before it and continue to be more after it McDonalds has truly perfected the formula when it comes to fast food.  The speed at which their food was made, the low price making it seemingly affordable for everyone, and the entertainment for the kids in happy meal toys and play grounds built into the establishment were all firsts with in the food industry. This was something that no restaurant before them had done before and catered perfectly to new \u2018on the go\u2019 family lifestyle that was beginning to be popularized. \n\tHowever, as we continue to grow up there comes a time in all our lives where our tastes begin to change and allure of the golden arches starts to fade. For me this time was right before I started middle school, the happy meals no longer filled me up like they once did and I had started to get to big for the play place. It is at this point in life that we start to see the ideals from the McDonaldization theory being put in practice inside of the stores. There are four main ideals that the McDonaldization theory puts into practice, efficiency, calculability, predictability and standardization, and control. Efficiency is the choosing of means to reach and end rapidly and is usually portrayed as a benefit to the consumer but in reality is in the interests of the company. For example, drive thru windows and filling your own drink are both ways fast food restaurants cut costs as their employees are doing less work and making sure all the food is pre-made helps to speed up wait times letting the restaurants serve more customers faster. Calculability emphasizes the companies desire to have things like money and supplies calculated and accounted for as this lets companies know exactly how much each aspect of their product costs. Predictability and standardization refer to companies attempts to make sure that their products are all the same no matter where a consumer may buy them from. The best example of this comes from the fast food industry as you could go to any two McDonalds and a Big Mac would taste the exact same at both locations. The final ideal is control, which is what these companies want to have over their customers. Any company using the McDonaldization theory has a set way of doing things which is made abundantly clear to the customer as soon as the walk in the door. Take any fast food restaurant for example, it is expected of you to know what you want when you reach the register, money already out to pay, and then you stand off to the side while you wait. \n\tThe theory of McDonaldization was developed by sociologist George Ritzer in his book \u201cMcDonaldization of Society\u201d which he released in 1993. Throughout this book, Ritzer is providing the reader with insightful knowledge about how the principles predominately found in the fast food industry are working their way into other aspects of society. Ritzer\u2019s main basis for this argument comes from the theory of rationalization which was developed by Max Weber. In essence the theory of McDonaldization is the process of rationalization as one of its fundamental aspects is that any task should and can be rationalized. Rationalization is a sociology term that refers to the replacement of traditional decision motivators with the ideals of efficiency and rationality instead.  As a result of this the user is left with an easily controllable process of efficient and logical tasks that can be completed in the same manner each time to produce the same outcome without fail. \n\tOutside of the obvious in McDonalds, on of the biggest corporations to adopt the McDonaldization theory is Amazon. With its continuous digital growth and focus on stream lined efficiency with their customers, Amazon has been able to use the McDonaldization method to create on of the most successful business to date. Its most basic principle being that of efficiency as Amazon has developed a straight forward direct to consumer sales approach that allows its customers to buy any product they need from their couch. There is also an aspect of predictability and calculability when shopping through Amazon because there are clear steps you need to follow when placing your order and when you do you know exactly how much it is all going to cost as the prices of products are clearly marked on the website. \n\tAnother major industry that has seen more of a reliance on the McDonaldization method is banking. Going to the bank used to be an ordeal that could last you hours but now with the advancements in technology the whole process has become for more efficient and calculated. Some of the biggest ways that the banking industry has become more efficient is through ATMs, mobile deposits, direct deposits, and the ability to automatically pay your bills. The efficiency in banking has grown drastically through the use of ATMs allowing use to withdraw money at any given time and the development of mobile deposits which allows us to cash checks with just a few photos. Auto bill pay has also helped with efficiency as customers can now have their bills automatically paid straight out of their account each month instead of having to deal with paying bills manually. Calculability has also seen a sharp increase now that we banks have developed their own apps, allowing us to see exactly how much money is in our accounts at all times. \n\tThe media has also been affected by the McDonaldization theory as news outlets are producing more stories that, like the food found at McDonalds, are fast easy reads that lack any true substance for the consumer. Many of the stories now are written with the hopes of reaching as wide of an audience as possible and usually are very cheap to produce maximizing profits. The biggest form of media that utilizes the McDonaldization method is social media. Social media has a focus on quick content that are meant to keep the audiences attention for long periods of time. Prime examples of this are the apps Tik Tok and Instagram as they produce short meaningless clips that use the simple act of swiping to keep the audience engaged. \n\tOverall the McDonaldization theory has seen continued success in a variety of different industries over the years with many more industries starting to adopt its ideals. Its focus on the four main ideals of efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control make it easy for any company to adopt and helps to satisfy our ever growing need for instant satisfaction as a society. As our society continues to grow and as technology continues to advance, the theory of McDonaldization will grow as well finding its way into even more industries in the future. \n\nWorks Cited\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1469540518818628 \nhttps://culturalstudiesnow.blogspot.com/2019/04/summary-mcdonaldization-of-society.html ",

        "text": "SOC 105 - 006\n5/2/22\nRacism and Prejudice in Contemporary Society\n\tWhy do individuals of color face racism and prejudice from all angles of society? Judgment based upon race and ethnicity is omnipresent within contemporary society and extends much farther than the traditional discussion. Often, when discussing the plight of individuals of color, it can seem that these individuals are solely oppressed by the dominant social group. This dominant social group is said to be well-to-do white individuals, who are primarily male. However, people of color face judgment and prejudice from not only the dominant social group but also those in their own social group and those of similar ethnicities. Individuals of color and of various ethnicities face this racialization from other minorities as well as the individuals within their own race or social class. Why is it that minorities face this hardship from not only the dominant group but also other minorities? It is a complex issue that has a complex reasoning behind it. While it may be easy to assume that individuals of the same race or similar minority status would have a shared empathy for one another, this is often not the exact reality. \n\tThe roots of this issue are based on the fact that there is a \u2018matrix\u2019 nature to social status and privilege. This matrix is known as the \u2018Matrix of Domination\u2019 which explains the varying levels of privilege in society by acknowledging how the characteristics of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality all intersect. This matrix gives way for varying levels of privilege and can often pose minority groups against one another, creating prejudice and racialization from all sides. This phenomenon can be observed in various situations within the lives of individuals in contemporary society.\n\tThroughout my own childhood, I have seen the levels of privilege and reracialization amongst minorities take form in many situations. This has primarily been observed through my involvement in the sport of soccer. I have played soccer throughout my entire life, beginning when I was around 5 years old. I have continued on to play soccer in middle school, high school, and still today while in college. Along the way, I have made many Hispanic friends who are deeply engaged in the culture of the sport. Due to our similar passions, I have built a strong connection with the Hispanic community throughout my childhood. Many of my current friends are Hispanic and frequently invite me to cultural gatherings and family events. I even currently play on an adult league soccer team that is exclusively Hispanic aside from myself. This team, made up of many of my best friends, plays and practices together every week and often go out for dinner together. \n\tOne of my many experiences with this team came several months ago when we had an open practice that anyone could attend. As usual I arrived early with one of my best friends, Adrian, and a few others on the team. When we arrived at the park, the field we normally practice on was taken up by a large group playing flag football. The rest of the team and I all waited by our cars as more and more people showed up for our upcoming practice. As the time for practice arrived, the field was still occupied and everyone on my team started to get a bit frustrated. As we all stood around, some of the Hispanic players began to talk to each other about the people taking up the field in a very crude way. These people playing football were primarily black and the Hispanic individuals started using racial slurs amongst each other and making many racist comments. I was shocked that they were so disgusted and offended by these black individuals doing absolutely nothing wrong. Eventually, we were able to practice and these comments eventually stopped. However, this was not the last time I saw this happen. \n\tNot only did I see this type of racial judgment and prejudice applied to individuals of another race, I also saw Hispanics do this within their own ethnicity. Many of the hispanics who come to practice are Mexican or Honduran, while some come from other backgrounds. During one game in particular, we played against a primarily Columbian team who were made up of individuals of a different heritage and slightly different complexion. After the game, several slurs were used between players of my team and the Columbians. Both seemed to be very resentful of each other and judge each other based on their complexion and heritage.\nPatricia Collins explains this phenomenon in relation to the concept of the \u201cmatrix of domination\u201d. The matrix of domination is made up of various levels and determines an individual's privilege based on their race, gender, sexuality, etc. In this matrix, each individual has a position determining their privilege. Collins states the following, \u201cDepending on the context, an individual may be an oppressor, member of an oppressed group, or simultaneously oppressor and oppressed\u201d (Collins 405). The dominant group made up of white, well educated, male individuals are positioned at the top while subordinate groups fall beneath. Amongst these subordinate groups, there are differences in heritage, education, race, etc that determine their level of privilege in relation to the matrix. All social aspects of an individual intersect to determine a person's \u201cposition\u201d in this hierarchy of perceived status.\nIn relation to my personal experiences, the Hispanic individuals on my team have a position on the matrix of domination. Being that they are Hispanic, they are often oppressed by the dominant group on both a systemic and personal level. Not only are they oppressed due to their race but also their ethnic background. However, they see themselves as positioned higher on this matrix than black individuals. It is almost as if subordinate groups seek to position themselves closer to the dominant group and distinguish themselves from other subordinate groups. In an effort to position themselves as not completely subordinate, the Hispanic individuals in my personal example choose to oppress another minority group. Thus, Blacks face prejudice from not only the dominant group but also other minorities who seek to impose the same oppression as the dominant group in an effort to advance their social position. There is almost a mindset amongst the Hispanic community that while they are oppressed, they are not at the lowest position on the matrix of domination.\nNot only does oppression occur across different minority groups, it can also occur within a particular minority or amongst a certain ethnic group. This concept is discussed in Tomas Almaguer\u2019s piece, \u201cRace, Racialization, and Latino Populations in the United States\u201d. Almaguer states, \u201cthese groups [Mexicans and Puerto Ricans] then reracialize each other under the discursive logic that structures the meaning of race in the United States' ' (63). This means that minority groups apply similar patterns of racism as the dominant groups amongst their own ethnicity/race. This reracialization occurs as race is a symbolic concept and there is an established logic of a racial hierarchy which individuals seek to perpetuate. Not only is racism applied from the dominant group but also across the individuals of a particular subordinate group.\nThe Mexican individuals of my soccer team exemplify this instance of reracialization amongst the Latino community. The Columbians and Mexicans that I met, have similar cultural backgrounds and experiences of oppression. However, the Mexican individuals attempt to position themselves higher on the \u2018racial hierarchy\u2019. To do so, these individuals apply the same patterns of racism as the dominant group does. In turn, a structure of hierarchy is created amongst their own ethnicity. Through applying racism amongst their own ethnicity, these individuals seek to position themselves as a dominant group within their own Latino community. The negative ideas of blackness that are present within the United States are imposed amongst individuals within the Hispanic community as well, explaining why these Mexican individuals have a negative outlook on the \u2018darker skinned\u2019 Columbians on the opposing team. The same structures of racism that oppress the Hispanic community are utilized by Hispanics to oppress other Hispanic individuals and establish a separate social hierarchy where one group is dominant to the other. \nThe plight of individuals of color is complex as there is not only systemic racism that they face but also a reracialization by other individuals of color. Each individual in contemporary society seeks to improve or maintain a particular status. No one wants to be considered to be at the very bottom of the matrix of domination. Thus, oppressed individuals seek to oppress others in an effort of self advancement and placement in a higher social status. The logic of a racial hierarchy is not only perpetuated by the individuals with the most privilege, but also those who are oppressed. This makes for an experience of racism and prejudice that is very complex for individuals of color in contemporary society.\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n18 October 2021\nLight-Skinned Fetish and the Looking-Glass Self\n\tSixty years ago, most would question a man who darkened his skin.  Surprisingly, skin-darkening is essential to 21st-century white Americans.  To such claim, one may argue that \u201cwhite people aren\u2019t dark-skinned, so what have they done?\u201d.  Counterarguments are ironically self-damaging, for skin alteration is so commonplace that it camouflages itself as beauty.  Bronzer, tanning booths, and sunbathing are beautifying practices, though they are also manifestations of society\u2019s adolescent fixation with olive skin.  Truly, black people\u2019s culture is interpreted by many as \u201ccool\u201d, though black people\u2019s struggles are undesired.  As non-black Americans want not to be black, but rather black-adjacent, corporate America monetizes olive skin.  Using James Cooley\u2019s concept of the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d, Americans of all races internalize society\u2019s \u201clight-skin\u201d obsession, which we measure our value with.  \nRomil Hemnani, producer for rap group Brockhampton, once said, \u201cI want to live in the White House\u201d.  Here, Hemnani is not referring to the office of the President, but rather to a figurative structure that exclusively benefits white people.  For clarity, Hemnani is a brown-skinned Pakistani man.  In expressing his reservations for those who are racially privileged, Hemnani conveys a belief that is shared by millions of American minorities: fair skin makes life easier.  Needless to say, slavery\u2019s horrors are not still existent, and the days of pre-1964 are behind us.  Yet, public schools remain largely segregated, incarceration is racially disproportionate, and low wages primarily affect minority workers.  America\u2019s racist policy is blatant.  Simultaneously, ignorance must be bliss, for the whole of white Americans are current participants of skin-darkening practices.  These practices include tanning, bronzer application, and sunbathing.  Lip fillers, butt lifts, braids, and other Afrocentric features are occasionally assumed by non-black women.  A general population of non-black Americans don articles of clothing that are associated with hip-hop culture.  Attempts, by non-black people, to present themselves as black are ever-present in both suburbia and high-profile circles; celebrities like Madonna, Kylie Jenner, and Kim Kardashian-West have publicly presented themselves as black-adjacent.  The list of culture offenders is never-ending. \n\tFor many non-black Americans, particularly those who are neither non-black nor a separate minority, privilege is one hell of a drug.  Considering America\u2019s racist policy, one would concede Romil Hemnani\u2019s argument that fair skin eases life\u2019s societal burdens, though a population of non-black Americans seemingly want to be black.  Meanwhile, many dark-skinned people undergo surgeries to disassociate themselves from others who look similar.  In both cases, Americans want to appear \u201clight-skinned\u201d, which implies a black complexion that is light when compared to dark-skinned black complexions.  American beauty standards are so olive-toned that they are expected, but other countries encourage Eurocentric standards of beauty.  American magazines are significantly \u201cwhite\u201d, but general media tells a different story, one that includes racial ambiguity.  American society\u2019s obsession with a light-skinned aesthetic may be explained by Charles Cooley\u2019s \u201clooking-glass self\u201d.  Cooley was an American sociologist who developed numerous theories of societal effects on one\u2019s self, but the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d remains his most famous concept.  The \u201clooking-glass self\u201d refers to a self-perception that is based on how one is perceived by others.  This concept is dependent on how one\u2019s self appears in another\u2019s mind, similar to psychologist William James\u2019 \u201csocial self\u201d.  According to Cooley, we decide our peers\u2019 opinions regarding us, and we base our self-confidence, self-worth, and self-value on these imaginations.  Subsequently, we either dislike ourselves or like ourselves.  With relation to society\u2019s focus on racial ambiguity, the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d places value on olive skin.  This particular \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is accredited to several factors, and efforts of non-black people\u2019s to be associated with blackness are proof.\n\tPrior to its collapse, the Roman Empire admired Egypt for its giftedness in science, technology, engineering, and math.  Such international relationship would shock today\u2019s Americans, for the federal government has ties to few African countries.  Furthermore, we undoubtedly discourage black citizen\u2019s advancement via policy, culture, and legal loopholes.  That said, individuals cannot alter systems in a similar manner that is used to alter town-wide trends.  Social media has supplied youth with additional influence on fashions, styles, and trends.  Youth\u2019s proximity to aesthetics is much, much closer than their proximity to anti-black institutions, and the former is how a light-skinned ideal has fogged millions of non-black minds.  Simultaneously, visually multiracial beauty standards communicate value, which defines the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d at hand.  In most cases, the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is regarded as a basis for one\u2019s satisfaction with himself/herself that is, in-and-of itself, based on other\u2019s opinions of him/her.  The \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is a concept comparable to American psychologist George Mead\u2019s \u201csocial self\u201d, which assumes we internalize other\u2019s opinions.  The social self is popular as a sociological concept, and it concedes that our identities are conceived using socialization.  The \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is, essentially, cousins with Mead\u2019s \u201csocial self\u201d because it advocates that an individual\u2019s self-value is correlated with widely-held beliefs regarding him/her.  \n\tDescribed by the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is a cognitive process that utilizes perception to interpret social contexts.  That said, social ability is vital to one\u2019s understanding of the world.  In 2021, for example, users of Instagram recognize a relationship between popularity and monetary value.  Influencers may gain popularity by posting photos that alter their skin tones to match those of mixed-race people.  Money is earned when influencers pander society, and photo manipulation becomes survival.  The \u201clooking-glass self\u201d encourages humans to decide other\u2019s opinions of them, and it punishes, or rewards, us for deciding how we are perceived.  \n\tNon-black celebrities, influencers, and youth\u2019s audacity to assume a light-skinned aesthetic is enabled by accessibility to social media, spin, and popular culture, but rationale for such appropriation is embedded in the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d.  As previously mentioned, American society\u2019s \u201clooking-glass self\u201d uses a racially ambiguous standard to encourage appropriation of black culture by non-black people.  As black musicians, black athletes, and black actors have overcome enormous obstacles of racist policy, mainstream culture is more diverse than it was fifty years ago, and even white nationalists view black culture as \u201ccool\u201d.  Many white people have even attempted passing as African American.  In 2015, former NAACP president Rachel Dolezal received backlash for claiming to be half black.  In 2020, activist Sean King received online criticism for performative activism as he, too, pretended to be black.  Also in 2020, author Jessica Krug\u2019s European roots were uncovered, despite Krug\u2019s self-prescribed Afro-Latina identity.  Efficacy of society\u2019s mulatto-favoring \u201clooking-glass self\u201d is evidenced by dark-skinned Americans, as well.  Famous cases of skin-bleaching include Michael Jackson, Sammy Sosa, and Blac Chyna, all dark-skinned at birth.  Black casts like those of Black-ish, Grown-ish, and #BlackAF are predominantly light-skinned.  Most notably, influencers like Emma Hallberg, Jesy Nelson, and Kylie Jenner have been accused of \u201cblackfishing\u201d, which describes the act of an influencer using skin-darkening filters on photos to receive likes and, by default, gain sponsorships.  Not only does the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d value black culture, but it is also recognized by 21st-century workers as a method of accumulating wealth.  For black Americans exists an added \u201clooking-glass self\u201d that rewards assimilation, which partly configures a double consciousness within such Americans.  Regarding both appropriation and assimilation, all Americans are overwhelmed with a \u201cself\u201d that generates from the \u201clooking-glass\u201d, which places both societal value and monetary value on olive-tone skin.  In this case, the \u201clooking-glass\u201d refers to positive views of light-skinned Americans, and those not succumbing to light-skinned beauty are either void of monetary gain or insecure physically; black people are vulnerable to both negatives of dissatisfaction with their looking-glass selves.  \n\tTo be mixed is desirable, according to American youth, American influencers, and American celebrities, whose appearances decide trends.  Demand for tans, hairstyling, and plastic surgery is monetized under a capitalist economy.  To be unaware of racial ambiguity\u2019s desirability, one must live under a rock.  America\u2019s \u201cmixed\u201d economy produces both satisfaction and dissatisfaction in Americans of all races regarding their \u201clooking-glass selves\u201d.  Specifically, white Americans seek social, cultural, and financial gain through appropriation of black culture.  Simultaneously, black Americans experience additional effects, namely pressure to avoid adversity of racist institutions.  Light-skinned privilege pales in comparison to white privilege, but it also poses a threat to dark-skinned Americans.  Effects of the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d on opportunistic non-black Americans who determine their actions by a fetishizing society\u2019s views of them are damaging.  To be black in America will never be easy, yet passing for light-skinned in a community that oppresses is no different than passing for white in a community that enslaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sociology\n28 March 2021\nGraded Essay 3\n\tHow does the collective conscious relate to politics? How does disillusionment correlate with the collective consciousness? Author, Yuval Noah Harari, discusses in part one of his novel, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the importance of advancing technology and how it plays a role in politics, more specifically, liberalism. Views on politics have been construed from the collective consciousness. Similarly to Emile Durkeim\u2019s idea that religion gave birth to society, society places politics on a high pedestal. Without politics and government, there wouldn\u2019t be another form of organization and control. This need for government and politics stems from the collective conscious.\n\tTo begin, Emile Durkeim explains collective consciousness and collective representations. He believed that society is made up of individuals with ideas. These ideals are unspoken rules that organize the society of individuals. The collective consciousness forms collective representations which are symbols that define a specific thought, idea, or object. Emile Durkeim felt strongly about religion being one of the most highly viewed upon moral forces. Essentially, Emile Durkeim viewed religion as the reasoning behind society\u2019s morals and ethics. Similarly to Emile Dukeim\u2019s view on religion and how it shaped society\u2019s morals, Yuval Noah Harari believed that politics and liberalism shaped society.\n\tSociety places a high value on liberalism. These expectations create situations when political agendas fall through, a concept known as disillusionment. Harari emphasizes the idea that individuals tend to think in stories rather than in facts. He believed that society\u2019s current political situation is not progressing, it is not working. He believed that it\u2019s not working because individuals fear the concept of change. Like Emile Durkeim\u2019s view of how religion shaped morals, change behind a solidified concept is a hard idea to grasp. It is hard to accept and adapt to change. He believes that society should be working to welcome disruption in technologies, accept advantage objective realities, and reduce suffering and brutality. Harari sees that society places a high value on government, but unlike Durkeim, he feels negatively towards the way it has shaped society. He believes that reform is needed because this story has started to become problematic for society. However, he does recognize that society needs democracy and free markets in order to function. \n\tIn conclusion, both Durkeim and Harari have similar views that religion and government shape society. However, as life progresses, it is important to keep up to date with technology and society. Society constantly advances itself, so it is important to accept change and adapt in order to not be left behind. It is important to recognize that this story of disillusionment of liberalism is not working for society. It is important to start looking towards change even though the collective conscious created unspoken rules, generations ago, and representations that society is unknowingly expected to follow. ",

        "text": "\nWho defines gender? We, as a society, have a subconscious set of guidelines for the expression of gender and how individuals that identify with a specific gender should portray themselves, but who is coming up with these concepts and social expectations of gender expression? The definition and social construct of gender is constantly changing and being redefine in society. However, society knows these guidelines we subconsciously have for gender, but how do we formulate those common expectations? \n\tThroughout much of history, women were seen as the inferior gender. Women were considered to be weak, frail, emotional, and their purpose was to take care of the house, children, and serve their husband. Women were seen as needy, and they were expected to get married and rely on their husband to provide them with basic needs. However, men were thought of as the providers or supporters of the family. It was the man\u2019s duty to work, put food on the table, and put a roof over their family\u2019s head. Men were considered to be tough, emotionless, and superior. Men were the head of the household, the ones making all of the decisions for the family as a whole. These ideas within the gender roles have begun to change over the past few decades as individuals begin to challenge these roles and standards. Women are becoming more independent of men, obtaining a higher level of education, working towards equality in the job market, both genders making money along with providing for the family, sharing responsibilities at home, and more. There is still progress to be made in changing the gender roles from what they used to be, however, there is a lot of change that has already taken place and continues to grow in providing opportunities for change and equality for women. \n\tSociety has set expectations on what is believed to be \u201cnormal\u201d expression of male and female genders. We apply society\u2019s expectations of gender expression subconsciously with every person we meet. Think about it this way, when we see an individual walking past us on the sidewalk, wearing a dress, has on makeup, has long and curly hair, is wearing heels, and is carrying a purse, we automatically assume that the gender of that individual is female just based on what we observe initially before we have even met that individual. This assumption is made due to the fact that the characteristics they are expressing are consistent with societal norms of expression for the female gender. When we see an individual walking past us on the sidewalk, wearing a suit, a tie, dress shoes, wearing a nice watch, has very short hair, and is carrying a briefcase, we automatically assume that the gender of that individual is male simply based on what we can observe in that brief interaction. This assumption is made due to the fact that the characteristics that they are expressing are consistent with societal norms of expression for the male gender. However, if we see an individual walking past us on the sidewalk, wearing a skirt, floral blouse, has very short hair, has facial hair, is wearing tennis shoes, and is carrying a bookbag, we will be a little confused and not sure quite what their gender is exactly, just based on the characteristics they are expressing, since they are not completely consistent with a specific gender as determined by societal norms. \nThis idea behind gender expression roles occurs due to society having an unspoken standard for the way that individuals should conduct themselves based on which gender they want to portray to the rest of the world around them. When discussing the \u201cDoing Gender\u201d reading by West and Zimmerman in class, we came up with a list of traits that society associates with a specific gender. The traits that were outlined as being associated with the female gender include having long hair, wearing dresses, wearing makeup, being overly emotional, and being subservient. These are some of the traits that individuals wanting to portray a feminine gender would \u201cneed\u201d to display, according to society. The traits that were outlined as being associated with the male gender include having shirt hair, wearing suits or button up shirts, not wearing any makeup, being stoic, and being dominant. Again, these are some of the traits that individuals wanting to portray a masculine gender would \u201cneed\u201d to display to others, according to societal norms. Gender is said to be a routine accomplished in everyday interaction; it is not considered a property of individuals. The idea of gender is a social construct and society sets a sort of \u201crubric\u201d for individuals to follow when \u201cdoing gender.\u201d We also discussed that the second wave of feminism, which occurred in the 1950s, challenged the cult of domesticity and had the goal of working towards things like equality in the workplace, changes in gender roles, and more. Society is coming to a point now where individuals are challenging the idea of gender and making it more of a fluid concept, meaning that gender can change depending on the intended expression of the individual. This is obviously a huge shock to the older population in society who are used to the gender roles that existed many years ago and the younger population challenging these ideas is receiving a lot of backlash due to the resistance to change most people have. West and Zimmerman also discuss the idea that gender is an ongoing accomplishment, reinforcing the idea that gender is a fluid concept and is constantly changing. Society is having to unlearn and relearn the idea of gender as it changes, like the introduction of male to female transexuals as well as female to male transexuals. \nAs a society, we know and understand the subconscious standards that exist for gender expression. Although gender is becoming more and more fluid as the definition changes according to societal standards and norms, collectively, we all know and understand the roles we play in society and how we are supposed to portray ourselves towards others based on the gender we identify as. In Durkheim\u2019s passage about \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation,\u201d the concept of \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d is explored. This is a very important concept in sociology and when trying to grasp how society forms the norms and standards that are commonly understood among citizens. The collective consciousness is defined as the norms, beliefs, and ideas that characterize a social system. Different social systems have different collective consciousnesses, which is why gender norms and expectations differ from place to place throughout the world. The collective consciousness of a group represents the ideas or values of that group that are commonly shared and accepted. We define gender based on how the collective consciousness of society views gender. The collective consciousness is constantly changing as the values, beliefs, norms, and ideas of a society change. We can see this very prominently in today\u2019s society as the fight to change gender expression and gender norms is ongoing, especially in the younger generation.\nThere are many different sociological concepts that tie into the formation and implementation of gender roles, norms, and expression. The collective consciousness of a society has the biggest impact on how society collectively views gender and what the accepted norms are for gender and expression. This concise representation of the ideas behind gender are constantly changing and being rewritten. The collective consciousness is constantly being challenged in a way that gender is becoming more and more fluid. Individuals are able to express their gender identity in a more widely acceptable way, especially if it does not align with the strict gender roles/ representation of the past that some members of society still value. Gender is something that is constantly changing as society changes the standards, norms, ideas, and beliefs that it has towards gender, expression, roles, and characteristics. ",

        "text": "The Paradox of Heather\nI wish I were Heather. In the beginning of 2020, I heard this lyric countless times. I would scroll for hours on end on TikTok, watching girls compare themselves to celebrities, influencers, models \u2013 any woman who they believed to be perfect; any woman they deemed a Heather. This was a trend that had taken off on TikTok rather quickly. Given that this was the beginning of quarantine, teenagers spent much of their time online to make up for the lack of social interaction. In doing so, women began to closely follow the lives of beautiful and famous models and celebrities, which bred comparison. Young girls found comfort in each other, creating an environment where they could speak freely about their insecurities and self-image issues with no fear of judgement. This trend allowed women to display their despair about feeling inferior to other woman, feeling as though they weren\u2019t, and could never be as beautiful, as skinny, as tan, as popular as these women; that I could never be Heather. \nAfter watching so many of these videos, I began to feel the same way: How could anyone ever think I\u2019m beautiful, when there are women who look like that?! Although there were many different women who were deemed Heathers, all of them had an indescribable quality. Everything about them was beautiful \u2013 and everything they had was something I felt I lacked in myself. When looking at these girls, I couldn\u2019t help but envy them. The beauty standard for women is regarded as completely unattainable, but somehow, they were able to perfectly embody it. \nNot only were these women beautiful, but they were popular, rich, and famous \u2013 more things I could never be. Although I knew some of them spent thousands of dollars on plastic surgery and continued to pay for injections, that didn\u2019t affect how I felt. I still wanted to be them. I still wanted to be free from insecurity and the thought that I could never be worthy of anything.  \nI continued to watch the videos, and after some time, I noticed something. The women who originally posted these videos were Heathers. They were the women that others were scrupulously comparing themselves to. As I continued to watch these videos and notice this pattern, I began to feel differently. Being Heather wouldn\u2019t keep me from feeling insecure or stop me from comparing myself to other women. Women that I felt were the beauty standard still felt the same insecurity that I did, and still found women who they deemed to be perfect. \nIn reading comments, I found that many other women had reached the same conclusion. So many girls felt that they were so below what was considered perfect, when others found them to surpass that. Naomi Wolf explains the reason why women think this way about themselves. Wolf describes women being judged based off their appearance as the beauty myth. The beauty myth is defined as, \u201cAn obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society\u2019s impossible definition of the flawless beauty.\u201d This concept is a violent backlash against feminism because it uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women\u2019s advancement. Wolf argued that the beauty myth affected women in multiple categories such as work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. This myth established by the mind of men has carried its way into the mind of women immensely which has caused a mass amount of competition between women. Due to the competition women face with one another, because of a man\u2019s idea of a perfect woman, has prohibited the ability for women to create a community. Men have been able to hold onto their power over women because of this. Women must learn and start to oppose of the beauty myth and see their worth through more than just their looks. \nEvery woman wants to be Heather because that\u2019s what men have deemed as perfect. The unrealistic beauty standard that women try to achieve doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect their own personal beliefs, rather, the ideal woman that men have defined.  While men are not the ones who are the targets of the standard of beauty for women, they still are the primary influence for what it is.\nWhy do women stare at celebrities every day idolizing their looks? Why do women constantly compare themselves to unrealistic standards of beauty? Why do I want to be anyone but myself? The beauty myth, created by the minds of men, has taken over the way women perceive their worth. The beauty myth has convinced a lot of women that they need to be flawless or else they aren\u2019t worthy of love, or respect. \nMany women have begun to believe that when they get cheated on, it\u2019s because they weren\u2019t pretty enough, or they just weren\u2019t enough in general for their boyfriend at the time. This was a sentiment I shared. I believed that I got cheated on because I wasn\u2019t pretty enough for him. But now, I realize I can\u2019t blame myself or my looks for the wrongdoing of a man. I recognized that I blamed my looks because the beauty myth created by men was engraved into my mind regarding my self-worth. The beauty myth explains why I\u2019m sometimes unaware of what I deserve because I\u2019m so wrapped around the idea that I wasn\u2019t perfect enough for him; that he cheated on me because the other girl was much prettier, and I should\u2019ve done better. \nThe beauty myth has rerouted the minds of women into thinking that they are the problem. That they weren\u2019t pretty enough for their boyfriend to remain loyal to them. Wolf states, \u201cIt is no accident that so many potentially powerful women feel this way.\u201d The beauty myth impacts so much of a women\u2019s own worth and respect. Women need to come together to take down the power men hold over their self-worth. They need to break the unrealistic cycle of beauty created by men that has gone on for countless years. \nWomen put so much pressure on themselves to seek out perfection due to the beauty standard created by men in society. I see this everywhere on social media and specifically through \u201cthe Heather\u201d trend on TikTok. Beautiful women and girls comparing themselves to other beautiful women. Beautiful women blaming themselves for the disloyalty of a man. Beautiful women suppressing their worth because of their looks. The beauty myth has disrupted the raw understanding of the world, that everyone deserves the best in life no matter who you are or what you look like. Women must come together to fight the unrealistic standards created by men and men must stop putting so much pressure on women to fit such unrealistic standards of beauty. Women must learn to believe that they are deserving of everything and anything no matter their looks. There shouldn\u2019t continue to be a beauty standard through the eyes of men, there should be a beauty standard created by a woman for that woman and no one else. Every woman is Heather, and every woman should fight to break the unrealistic beauty standard and take their power back. \n\n",

        "text": "1214\nSociology 105\n1 April 2024\nComparing the Working Class and the Discriminated Class\n\tIn the United States a large majority of the population is made up of the working class, similarly a large majority of the country is also made up of people who have experienced a form of discrimination. While the working class experiences economic oppression, the group of people who have dealt with challenges of discrimination often face societal oppression along with various other forms of subjugation. Domhoff's idea of the working class takes the time to dissect many groups within capitalist societies. The concept of discrimination offers insights into how social society forms deep suppression and prejudice. However, with an understanding of these two concepts people still often fail to realize how frequently these two notions tend to cross paths. After analyzing Domhoff's take on the working class and the concept of discrimination, it is evident that these two classes have many daily similarities. Understanding of the similarities and variations of these theories allows individuals to gain a broader comprehension of what many people around the country experience daily.\n\tAn eye opening example of these two concepts colliding is the explanation of a simple norm for families all around the United States. To provide better clarity, there is a hypothetical yet realistic story about a woman named Maria. Maria happens to be a single, Latina mother who is currently working numerous jobs to support herself and her children. Everyday Maria experiences multiple acts of discrimination in the workplace due to many factors. She was being judged for many characteristics like her ethnicity, her gender, her clothes looking cheaper than others, and more. This discriminatory behavior is part of the reason why she faces limited career improvement opportunities, and is paid a lower wage compared to her white and male coworkers. Discrimination is known as the unjust treatment of people based on certain characteristics. Domhoff's view of the working class puts emphasis on the role it plays as a subordinate group in capitalist societies. This example of Maria shows how these two subjects can intertwine and leech off of eachother in many negative ways. Maria is unable to get a higher paying job due to the reasons she is discriminated against. However, a significant reason why she is discriminated against is for not having an extremely well paying job. In the end, the process comes full circle. The intriguing example provided showcases the disadvantages faced by these groups. The expectations are set impossibly high for people in these minorities and within the working class. As there are so many opportunities available, but all of them lack a sense of reality and attainability. Maria struggles everyday to keep her family financially stable as she is stuck in this perpetual rotation of inequality. Race, gender, socioeconomic examples of discrimination in the working class are all very prime examples. However, there are even more ways that these two concepts can intersect. This same concept also applies to those who are in the working class and the LGBTQ+ community, society often fails to accept them and treat them with the same respect they would treat a heterosexual with. This also goes for those who struggle with disabilities. Lastly, a more hidden form is discrimination in the workplace can be age! Many who achieved goals young, or work into their older years, are often judged or misvalued. Because of these issues, there is also an issue within job security. The large majority of wealth in our country is held within a very small amount of people on the large scale of population. Why are we treating the majority of our country disrespectfully just because the top one percent holds the most wealth? The system often feels backwards. Overall, all of these representations of discrimination in the workplace contribute to the difficulty with advancement opportunities. These individuals struggle daily within society because they are stuck between a rock and hard place due to things they often have no control over. \n\nDomhoff's approach of the working class, and the concept of discrimination overall show deep connections through the daily similarities that these two groups face. Gaining a broader insight of the similarities and variances of these two concepts allows individuals to grow a deep comprehension of the loops and twists of our society's economic system and social systems. Our country has learned how to use personal characteristics that are out of an individual's control and vilanize them in society. Overall, Domhoff explains the details of the working class and numerous forms of discrimination in an informative way that is eye opening. The widespread effect of these boundless walls, created for individuals that fit the profile to be discriminated against, is something that people around the country fail to understand. In total, the working class and the discriminated class share more similar struggles and intersections than many often realize. ",

        "text": "How Gender Affects the Workforce\n\nOur personal beliefs and morals are heavily influenced by society and the people in it. As a society, we have determined that gender is dichotomous and an important social identity. This means our conception of gender is part of our collective consciousness. The collective consciousness is the shared beliefs and values that connect individuals in a society. In other words, we view society through a group consciousness. In his article \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations,\u201d Emile Durkheim explains this phenomenon in terms of religion. He writes, \u201cThus the collective ideal which religion expresses is far from being due to a vague innate power of the individual, but it is rather at the school of collective life that the individual has learned to idealize.\u201d  In this quote, Durkheim explains that our values do not stem from individuals, but that individuals learn to idealize certain values. According to Durkheim, these shared ideas are manifested through collective representations in the form of rituals, artifacts, symbols, and values. This is true for gender, as it is represented in art, advertisements, language, celebrations, institutions, etc. The idea of two distinct genders is a common belief that is deeply rooted in our society. The gender binary stems from the concept of sex. This comparison is inaccurate, however, as there are some key differences. According to authors Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman in \u201cDoing Gender,\u201d sex is determined by biology, anatomy, and hormones. Gender, in contrast, is achieved through psychology, culture, and social means. The two are connected through a concept known as sex category, or the identifying features that categorize someone as male or female. West and Zimmerman argue that because of this, gender is something we \u201cdo\u201d when we align our outward appearance and behavior with those expected of a specific sex category. For this reason, western society believes that men and women are inherently different, with phycological and behavioral discrepancies that can be determined based on reproductive organs. This aspect of our collective consciousness has been used to justify the social consequences of assuming \u201cgender roles.\u201d\nThroughout history, the female gender has been considered inferior. In the article \u201cWomen as Other,\u201d author Simone de Beauvoir argues this is because women have always been considered the \u201cother\u201d in society while men are considered absolute. Beauvoir argues that this ideology didn\u2019t just appear, as women have always been treated as subordinates. Women often submit to this point of view because they do not have a history, religion, or community of their own separate from men. Women have always been tied to men, and therefore have been unable to separate from their oppressors. This historical mistreatment of women is evident when examining the unequal division of labor in western society. In the article \u201cTwo worlds of female labour: gender wage inequality in western Europe 1300-1800,\u201d authors Alexandra de Pleijt and Jan Luiten Van Zanden examine the underutilization of women in European labor markets from 1300-1800. Pleijt and Zanden argue that for women to be autonomous and remain single, they must be able to earn a living wage. Additionally, women participating in labor increased the human capital formation, but required women to be educated, skilled, or limit their fertility, all of which were undesirable for the time. For this reason, opportunities for women to work were not comparable to that of men. Following the Black Death, poor economies and low population required more women to join the workforce. In southern Europe, the gender wage ratio was approximately 0.5. In northern Europe, however, the gender wage ratio was much higher at 0.8. In medieval England, there were legal constraints that discouraged young, single women from working casually, and many were not allowed to work enough days to earn a livable wage. The sixteenth century market a time of labor market slack, in which the demand for labor was less than supply. This resulted in the gender wage ratio decreasing rapidly, with women making less than half of that of men. This trend continued through the nineteenth century. By examining these statistics, it becomes clear that gender has played a key role in determining who can participate in the labor market. This was a strategic decision to prevent women from making a living wage and becoming independent from men.\nBecause women were often unable to make a living wage, they were forced to marry young. A consequence of this is that women were often unskilled and uneducated. This allowed the traditional gender roles to remain intact as women became reliant on their husbands. Women were valued in society only for their fertility and were often patronized by their husbands. An example of this can be seen in Charlotte Gilman\u2019s \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper.\u201d In this story, the main character\u2019s husband, who is a physician, refuses to believe she is sick and insists that she is just hysterical. For this reason, she spends many hours in her room, unable to write or work. The woman feels guilty for not feeling more grateful for her husband, but she cannot deny her feelings of resentment. She directs this resentment towards her yellow wallpaper, a metaphor for the oppression she experiences as a woman. This demonstrates the struggle many women faced in the ninetieth and twentieth centuries. During this time, many women were unable to work or pursue an education. This often left women at the mercy of their husbands, who considered them hysterical for expressing resentment towards their gender roles. This power dynamic can also be seen in the cult of domesticity.\nThroughout history, women have been denied career opportunities and burdened with domestic duties such as childbearing, cooking, and cleaning. This reflects the cult of domesticity, or the belief that women should embrace these duties and create a loving home. As a result, women complete approximately 2/3 of all domestic work. Women are primarily responsible for the tasks that must be completed daily, while men complete scheduled maintenance. Domestic responsibilities are time consuming, especially raising children. This can prevent women from pursuing careers and fulltime jobs, often leaving them unemployed or employed part time. Women who work fulltime are not exempt from these duties, however, as many are involved in a junior partner/senior partner relationship. These relationships exist when both partners have careers, but the woman has a \u201csecond shift\u201c in which she must also complete domestic work. This issue has only worsened recently due to the covid-19 pandemic. In the article titled \u201cA gendered pandemic: Childcare, homeschooling, and parents\u2019 employment during COVID-19,\u201d authors Richard Pettes, Daniel Carlson, and Joanna Pepin explain that the availability of domestic support like daycare and school are important for mother\u2019s labor force participation, while father\u2019s participation is generally unaffected. As a result of daycares and schools closing due to covid and the domestic labor that follows, mother have been significantly more likely to reduce their work hours. According to Petts, Carlson, and Pepin as of April 2020, the beginning of lockdowns, the unemployment rate for women was 16.2% and 13.5% for men. This is an example of traditional gender roles in which women are responsible for childcare and housework and men for breadwinning. The responsibilities associated with each gender are harmful to women, as they are often unable to participate in the workforce due to responsibilities at home.\nThough women have made many advancements in the workforce, there are still many obstacles. One example is the gender pay gap. In the article \u201cThe Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations,\u201d authors Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn examine why and how the pay gap has changed. According to Blau and Kahn, there are several reasons why the pay gap exists. Firstly, familial attitudes and gender norms often reduce women\u2019s work life and discourage them from pursuing formal schooling. Secondly, women tend to gravitate towards lower paying college majors like art as opposed to science. Thirdly, it is often difficult for women to make advancements in the workplace due to bias. In the early twentieth century, women made approximately 60% as much as their male counterparts. Around 1980, however, women\u2019s wages rose, and the gap changed to around 67%. This trend has continued at around 79% today. Blau and Kahn argue that this improvement is due to the shrinking education and experience gaps. In 1981 only 15.3% of women had a bachelor's degree and 13.5 years of work experience, with men at 18.1% and 20.3 years. These gaps have shrunken, with 24.7% of women in 2011 having a bachelor\u2019s degree and 16.4 years of experience, with men at 26.2% and 17.8 years. The gender wage gap reveals that women often receive less opportunity for advancement and higher paying jobs based solely on the concept of gender. These statistics show the division of labor between genders.\nGender is a social construct embedded in our collective consciousness. As a society, we have come to believe that there are two inherently different genders who assume different roles. This idea is ingrained in our institutions and affects many aspects of our society. This is extremely evident when examining the workforce. Throughout history, it has been difficult for women to find and maintain job opportunities because of traditional ideas of gender, as women are mostly responsible for domestic labor. This made women reliant on their husbands and has kept them as the \u201cother\u201d in society. Though women have made advancements, the gender wage gap and the unequal unemployment caused by the covid-19 pandemic are continuous reminders that there is still progress to be made. By adjusting our understanding of gender, we can create equal opportunities for everyone in society.",

        "text": "Profesor Elliott\nIntroduction to Sociology\n26 February 2021\nEssay Brief 5\n\tThe collective consciousness is a critical aspect of studying Sociology when developing theories of race and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity are two different concepts symbolizing different aspects of the United States\u2019 society. Studying the differences between race and ethnicity are crucial components to spreading awareness of racism, as spreading awareness is the first step to liberties for every matrix. Author, Patricia Hill Collins, portrays the subconscious hierarchies of oppression. She discusses the structure of domination within the country\u2019s society through a rank-ordered preference. Collins explains how the United States structures power and authority, the way in which the country is run. Similarly, the podcast \u201cGet Back to Where You Once Belonged\u201d highlights the oppression black women faced through personalized stories. The story focused on a specific family and the struggle the family endured based on their race. It\u2019s important to talk about how the collective consciousness developed a structured society based on a hierarchy of domination, with components such as race and ethnicity, and Collins illustrates the controversial themes of oppression.\n\tPatricia Hill Collins paints a picture of ranking within society -- ranking based off of order of a specific, unfair, preference. There were multiple levels of domination based on three levels. These levels are: level of personal biography, group or community level of the cultural context created by race, class and gender, and the systemic level of social institutions. Each level plays a role in symbolic privilege, this unspoken advantage that certain \u2018categories\u2019 of people have over other types of people. Patricia Collins advocates that the known studies of systematic disadvantage have been biased, only one race has studied the effects of racism on communities. Because of this biased research, she believes that scientists should approach the study in a different manner. She believes that the first step to freedom and rights for every group, even those considered minorities, begins with acknowledging intersectionality, the combination of different race and ethnic groups, including the different genders. Once awareness of different personal, cultural, and institutional knowledge is spread, scientists will be able to gain a better understanding of inequality. The Podcast \u201cGet Back to Where You Once Belonged\u201d is a prime example of spreading awareness.\n\t\u201cGet Back to Where You Once Belonged\u201d was an interview with a woman of African descent. She talks about the struggles she faced as an African American, light skinned, woman. She illustrates the feelings of unease, the feeling of being out of place. At a young age, Lily was faced with unfair stereotypes and cruel comments. Unknowingly, she would defend the perpetrators with the defense that these kids were just \u2018ignorant\u2019. She held high spirits, she chose to see the good in the people causing social unjust. Lily lived in Russia with her family because, although Russia wasn\u2019t considered Utopia for racism, Russia stood by the fact that they were less racist than the United States during World War II. African Americans stood by the Soviet Union in hopes for a better, more free life. Lily\u2019s family took the option to move to Russia, but still faced hardships, and although Lily chose to have good faith in her society, she was still oppressed. She talked about her damaged self-esteem, the feeling of loneliness, and the lack of trust in her community. Lily tried to date a Russian boy, but instead, she was faced with a cruel racist nickname, she even believed that the Russian boy was only dating her to see what it was like to date a black woman. She became more self-conscious of her skin as she grew older, but she also grew wiser. She talks about her philosophical beliefs about facing racism as a woman of color. She believes that in order to live a satisfying life of a minority, it is important to stop listening to the voice in her head blaming every little wrong on the color of her skin. She believes that she, and people like her, should just live their life, they should stop wasting time trying to change to conform to society and instead, drop the racist people who segregate, and continue to live life with people who aren\u2019t threatening. She ended up living a satisfying life as she grew older, she learned how to adjust to the oppression in order to be happy. \n\t\u201cGet Back to Where You Once Belonged\u201d is an important illustration of racialization. Racialization is the process that became ethnic identity, it\u2019s the process of counting and defining immigrants because they went against the norms of society -- the norms that the collective consciousness created. As society grew and advanced, the creation of community formed. Ethnic identities were based on commonalities. Lily, from \u201cGet Back to Where You Once Belonged\u201d faced racialization living in a community unlike the people of her own culture. She felt lonesome due to lack of commonalities with her community, she felt out of place because her identity was outnumbered by people of different identities. Lily had to adapt to a social hierarchy, as discussed by Collins in \u201cBlack Feminist Thought in the Matrix of Domination\u201d that went against her ethnic identity. It\u2019s important to spread awareness, to acknowledge institutionalized differences in order to create liberation for every community, including minorities. It\u2019s important to fight for freedom for everyone in society, to help those oppressed. More specifically, it\u2019s important to find ways to advocate for freedom for those oppressed. ",

        "text": "6386\nSOC 105-007\n1 May 2023\nWage Gap Empirical Puzzle\n\tAre women truly given a fair shot to make money compared to men? Millions of women are in the workforce today but make significantly less money than men. There is a wage gap that exists in America, and currently, it is eighty-two cents to every dollar a man makes. Women have already overcome many obstacles when it comes to oppression. The wage gap is another obstacle that must be overcome. The wage gap is not a problem that begins when women are in the workforce later in their careers it starts right when they enter. Not only is it difficult for women to make fair wages, women of color struggle much more when it comes to making fair wages in the workforce. There is a societal standard or view of women that their worth stems from their beauty rather than their qualifications. A lot of these standards can be tied to the concept of the beauty myth and doing gender.\n\tWhen I was 16 years old, I got my first job at a local Panera Bread. I was quickly trained and became one of the most dependable employees they had. I was the first one they always called to cover shifts, train people, and handle mishaps at the cash register. All the while I was working there, I was paid $9 an hour. I was training boys my age who were making more than I was. When I brought this up to management, they denied that there was a gap in my pay with the boys I was training. I knew that this was quite fishy so everything I did following that was done contemplating what management's plans were. Management tended to hire a lot of \u201cpretty\u201d people, but these people were not good at their job. The people they hired tended to fit into the norm and beauty myth. They just needed to be conventionally attractive to get the job it seemed. After all of my hard work, some of the managers started to realize, after a year, that I was a good employee to have around. They started to promise me a promotion and raise, but that never did happen. In my attempt to try and resolve the problems that existed at Panera, I spoke with managers on multiple occasions about the promotion, promises of a raise, and harassment from a male co-worker with nothing to be changed. The constant feeling of having no power was solidified and confirmed with all of the power that men had in the chain.\n\tThe power struggle can be explained by Naomi Wolf\u2019s \u201cbeauty myth.\u201d The concept of the beauty myth is that women are judged purely on their appearance and nothing more. In the \u201cbeauty myth,\u201d Wolf states, \u201cFeminism gave us laws against job discrimination based on gender; immediately case law evolved in Britain and the United States that institutionalized job discrimination based on women's appearances.\u201d (Wolf 2). The appearance of women takes an abnormal precedent when it comes to hiring decisions and the compensation between men and women. There is an inherent bias when it comes to men and women in the workplace. Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to pay equality. The current pay gap is 82 cents to a dollar which tends to relate to the beauty myth. A large portion of the gap comes from the basis of judging women and placing their value on their looks. For example, a man and woman who are hired at the same time with similar qualifications and work history will commonly have a wage gap. This can often be attributed to the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d within the working communities. \n\tThe concept of \u201cdoing gender\u201d also ties into the wage gap currently. \u201cDoing gender\u201d is a concept that refers to conforming to a certain gender type whether that be with clothes, mannerisms, or actions. Often women in the workforce do not get the same opportunities that men do. Women can certainly aim for jobs that are higher in the chain of working but sometimes they are not awarded those jobs. Women can be guided or coerced into job positions that are more \u201cfit\u201d for women. Some of those jobs include receptionists and assistants as opposed to leaders within their realm of work. The coercion for women in certain roles does not fall just into the corporate world it is everywhere, it is in college majors too. For example, gendered expectations say that women should major in more feminine things like nursing or teaching which is the opposite for men. The gender expectations for college majors can be an immediate disadvantage to how much money in a career path women can make. The \u201cdoing gender\u201d concept highlights the wage gap and the gendered expectations that loom over women especially. \n\tTo summarize, the gender wage gap is a complex issue that is influenced by many factors, including discrimination, workplace segregation, and differences in education and experience. However, the concepts of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d and \"doing gender\" shed light on how gendered expectations and norms can play a significant role in extending the wage gaps existence. The \u201cbeauty myth\u201d reinforces the idea that women must meet certain physical standards to be considered valuable and successful, which leads to discrimination in the workplace and limits women's earning potential. Similarly, \"doing gender\" focuses on how gendered expectations can influence the types of jobs that men and women pursue and how they negotiate for pay, which can also contribute to the wage gap. Overall, addressing the gender wage gap requires a wide-focused approach that recognizes and challenges the ways in which gendered expectations and norms can limit women's earning potential at any age. By promoting gender equality in all areas of life, we can create a more just and equal society where all individuals have the opportunity to succeed and thrive.\n\tIn conclusion, women are not given a fair shot to make money compared to men in the workplace. My own experience while working at Panera Bread is an example of the unfair and unequal pay between men and women in the workforce. Men have a leg up on fair wages because of certain fields they dominate in career paths as well as negotiations for pay ranges. While working at Panera I can now say that the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d and \u201cdoing gender\u201d largely contributed to the people that worked there. The \u201cbeauty myth\u201d was utilized quite often as how people would be compensated. The conventionally attractive employees were the ones who made more money regardless of their skill set and ability to do their job well. As for \u201cdoing gender\u201d among the employees at Panera it was something that was also commonly seen. Management would oftentimes try to get more of the male employees to higher ranks or work in the kitchen as line cooks whereas female employees would be recruited to work in the bakery or as a cashier. These opportunities are not equal and give a clear view into the inner workings of how the wage gap remains and is encouraged today. The wage gap is still very much something that currently and historically affects our pay which is an obstacle that must be overcome.",

        "text": "Essay 6\nThere are many myths circulating our collective consciousness regarding class and whether it truly exists. For example, as highlighted by Mantsios, many believe that class is not relevant, as everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. Another misconception, as highlighted by Domhoff, is that because we live in a democracy, we all have power in the government. In reality, the upper class is advantageous because they have more opportunities and influence in government and policy making. Mantsios explains that class affects where you live geographically and therefore what education you receive. Mantsios provides statistics showing that low-income students often score lower on standardized tests. This then translates into fewer job opportunities and a less optimistic outlook on life. Lower class individuals also have a higher mortality rate caused by health issues and less access to medical treatment. For these reasons, it\u2019s often difficult to ascend between classes. Domhoff also supports that the upper class receive more opportunities on an institutional level because of their heavily influence in economics and government. Nonprofit organizations often share many directors with large corporations. These nonprofits provide money to education, research, and political campaigns resulting in tax cuts, subsidies, and less regulations on business. Overall, they can leverage their wealth to support ideas that are compatible with their goals and set the standards by which the working class must operate. \nThough many fail to realize, one\u2019s class heavily influences their experience and what opportunities they receive. Authors Mantsios and Domhoff attempt to refute common misconceptions about class in America by highlighting the many ways the wealthy benefit from our capitalist society on both a personal and institutional level. The class system is very much alive in America and by recognizing its effects, we can lessen the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. By doing this, we can provide everyone with equal opportunities despite the family they\u2019re born into.\n",

        "text": "3034\n \nRationalization and McDonaldization: Exploring the of Efficiency and Control\nThe Concept of McDonaldization which was created by George Ritzer, is about the process through which methods of fast food restaurants, particularly exemplified by McDonald's, procreates through our various aspects of society. McDonaldization is made up of four key characteristics: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. All of these dimensions permeate through the fast food chains and outwards into greater society. McDonaldization also involves the change of traditional, human-centered methods with rationalized, systematized approaches aimed at maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs. This phenomenon results in the proliferation of standardized procedures, the prioritization of speed and convenience over quality, and the commodification of experiences. While McDonaldization facilitates convenience and expediency, it also engenders consequences such as homogenization, loss of individuality, and the erosion of traditional social interactions and cultural practices.\nThese two concepts, albeit holding similarities, do have some glaring differences in that they have completely different goals. The main idea of rationalization is that is reaching for one common goal and being rational all the time, its entire goal is to come to what is believed to be the best outcome and that people will be completely rational for the sake of others. This is contradicted by the belief of McDonaldization which in a way is entirely different in that it seeks to gain an increasing large stake in peoples lives by making everything simple and efficient via proven principles of specifically fast food everything is to be productive, etc. Another difference between these two is the approach in formality, the concept of Rationalization is deeply suited in formality and through old means of control such as things like governmental bureaucracy, etc. While its counterpart McDonaldization is informal and controls through newer means such as corporate control and that everything can and should be controlled and it wishes to spread through every aspect of life which it has.\ndespite their apparent disparities these two concepts are far closer than anything as in logical sense they form branches on the same family tree of sociological, ideological family tree with McDonaldization and both of these concepts use similar points being those of Efficiency, Calculability, Predictability and Control. Efficiency, the cornerstone of both rationalization and McDonaldization, dictates the relentless quest for optimal resource utilization and output maximization. Whether in bureaucratic procedures or fast food assembly lines, while calculability shows the measurement of inputs, outputs, and the like and leads to a process of standardization. Predictability entails the establishment of clear guidelines, protocols, and routines to minimize uncertainty and ensure consistency, and control which is the most important of these two imposes rules, hierarchy and order whether it benefits societal or corporate interests. In the end, both the ideals of Rationalization and McDonaldization harness these shared principles to rationalize and optimize processes, whether for the collective benefit of humanity or the narrow interests of profit-driven entities and that is what makes them the same yet different.\n. \nTop of Form\nBottom of Form\n",

One way is the increase in the spread of ideas and connectivity of the world through social media. According to Statista, in 2020, social media users included over 3.6 billion people worldwide. An implication of the prevalence of social media is the significant amount of false information that is spread throughout the population and perceived as truth by thousands, if not millions of people. In the United States, this issue came to light during the 2016 presidential election when Donald Trump utilized the phrase \u201cfake news!\u201d throughout his campaign and presidency. \u201cFake news,\u201d or false information disguised as truth, can be difficult to distinguish from credible news information. Additionally, an increasing number of people are turning to social media as an avenue for consuming news, where anyone has the freedom to post whatever they want. This is why it is so important to recognize and identify this dangerous force as it relates to the spread of ideas, beliefs, and the development of a collective consciousness. \n\tDurkheim argued for the existence of collective belief and idea systems throughout society. He believed that religion contributed to this collective consciousness which can be observed through collective representations. Collective representations are symbols that exist in society and have meanings placed upon them that have become fabricated and prevalent through the development of society. The concept of the collective consciousness is important to acknowledge because it can explain a lot about our society and can help us understand why certain behaviors and ideas are popular among the general population and among certain groups. In our current American society, there are various groups that have strong belief systems that are consistent among members of the group. For example, the groups of this kind that get the most attention are Democrats and Republicans. The belief systems of these groups have become more and more solidified and polarized through the use of social media. Fake news is important to fit into this narrative because it can help explain some of the tension between these two groups in the United States. \n\tA study conducted in 2018 by Pennycook and colleagues sought to examine the relationship between exposure to fake news headlines and perceived accuracy of these headlines. There is a previously proven idea in psychology called the \u201cillusory truth effect\u201d which is the process of being exposed to information and therefore being more likely to perceive the information as accurate, solely based on the fact that one was exposed to it, sometimes even only subconsciously exposed. This theory says that there is a positive relationship between amount of exposure to information and perceived accuracy of the information. Pennycook and colleagues (2018) attempted to understand whether or not the illusory truth effect would apply to fake news headlines that seem less plausible than the information used in previous research that examined this effect. In order to do this, they conducted three studies with slightly different conditions. The first study included \u201ctrivia\u201d statements that were easily identifiable as highly implausible. Researchers concluded that exposure/repetition to these statements had no impact on perceived accuracy due to the high implausibility of the statements. \nThe second study conducted by Pennycook and colleagues in 2018 included fake news headlines which included warnings about the possible inaccuracy of the information being presented. The results of the second study indicated that exposure to these headlines, (whether true or false, regardless of whether there was a warning indicating possible false information, and regardless of whether the information agreed with the person\u2019s political identity) increased perceived accuracy of the information. The third study found that exposure positively influences perceived accuracy of information, even with a week-long delay. Researchers pointed out that these findings have significant implications related to everyday life. For example, when politicians repeatedly communicate an idea to the public, based on these findings, people will be more likely to accept it; and the same applies to other ideas that may be impossible to definitively confirm or deny, such as religious beliefs (Pennycook et al., 2018). This study reinforces the idea that a high amount of exposure to information through social media, regardless of whether it is true, has a significant impact on the evolution of our collective consciousness and belief systems. \n\tThe social aspect of this issue is highly important to acknowledge because our belief systems are highly influenced by our environment. \u201cGroupthink\u201d is a phenomenon in psychology that occurs as a cycle, when group members\u2019 beliefs are strengthened through the influence of the group (Groupthink, n.d.). Individuals in society often classify themselves and are perceived to be included in many groups whether these groups are imaginary or institutional. According to Psychology Today, Groupthink is similar to the concept of conformity, but exclusively occurs during decision-making processes related to a group. The Psychology Today article explains that Groupthink can have dangerous implications when it occurs in parts of society that contain large scale groups such as politics. This is because the phenomenon of Groupthink can cause people to dismiss ethics and morals in favor of conforming to their group\u2019s priorities. According to Psychology Today, \u201c(\u201can \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality\u201d)\u2026 can prompt members to accept group perspectives, even when those perspectives don\u2019t necessarily align with their personal views.\u201d This displays the high impact of Groupthink on individuals. This phenomenon is important to note in the context of fake news and its impact on societal beliefs because it definitely seems to play a role in the perceived accuracy of fake news. For example, when Donald Trump and some media outlets downplayed the Coronavirus pandemic, it appears that many Republicans went along with these ideas. This was very dangerous because it prompted many people to disregard important CDC community safety guidelines; some even protesting important aspects of these guidelines such as mask-wearing. The simple use of the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d adds to a general mistrust of the media which could lead to issues for our society. \n\tResearch conducted by Colliander in 2019 examined the relationship between fake news on social media and individuals\u2019 conformity to its ideas through two studies. The first study included 3 experimental conditions in which participants were exposed to fake news social media posts. In the first condition, these posts included comments from social media users that expressed support for the information. The second condition included fake social media posts with comments that expressed disbelief or the acknowledgement of the post as fake news. The third condition included both types of comments: supportive and critical. The findings of this study indicated that the comments from other social media users influenced the likelihood that participants would share and/or comment on the posts. The second study was designed similarly to the first study but included a condition with no comments and another condition where there was a warning from the social media platform about the possible inaccuracy of the information. Based on the results of the second study, Colliander (2019) states, \u201cSocial media users seem to use the comments of other people as a guide for how to respond to disinformation online rather than disclaimers.\u201d This finding emphasizes the significant impacts of social influence on beliefs and perceptions of information, even false information. \n\tA study published in 2021 by Michael and Breaux aimed to examine whether political affiliation has an impact on the perception of fake news. Three almost identical studies were conducted, one in 2017, the second in 2018, and the last in 2020. Researchers hypothesized that people would trust news that agreed with their beliefs, and distrust news that disagreed with their beliefs. Participants were given a list of news sources and asked to rate them based on level of trustworthiness using the categories \u201creal news,\u201d \u201cfake news,\u201d and \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Participants were also asked to define the terms \u201creal news,\u201d \u201cfake news,\u201d and \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Researchers grouped participants based on \u201cself-reported political identification.\u201d (Michael & Breaux, 2021) The results of the study suggest that in general, more conservative people would view the news sources included in this study as less trustworthy than more liberal people. The two additional studies yielded similar results although there were some changes in the results due to the passage of time. Overall, researchers found that news sources that were rated as more trustworthy by liberals were likely to be rated as \u201cfake news\u201d/\u201d propaganda\u201d by conservatives and vice versa. Steps were taken to rule out level of familiarity as an explanation for perceived trustworthiness of the news sources. The findings of this study raise questions surrounding the influence of political groups on media consumption among the general public. Personal belief systems evolve over time partly due to the consumption of new information, therefore, with a high level of information absorption among individuals in society due to the current prevalent use of social media, it is important to acknowledge the influence of political ideologies on the acceptance and sharing of information. \n\tAllen and colleagues (2020) argued that the spread of fake news may not be an urgent crisis due to the actual prevalence of this type of media compared to other media types. Through their research study, they sought to understand the prevalence of fake news based on the ideas that people use various platforms to consume media and that there is a high variety of types of media and news content. In order to do this, they measured TV consumption and consumption of media through desktop and mobile devices. They found that on average, Americans spend over 7.5 hours per day consuming media (Allen et al., 2020). The results also demonstrated that news constitutes only a fraction of individuals\u2019 total daily media consumption, therefore, fake news must constitute a tiny fraction (about one tenth). Researchers noted that according to Google Scholar, between 2017 and 2020, 2210 English publications with \u201cfake news\u201d in the title emerged, while before this there were only 73. Although fake news is not widespread when compared to total media consumption, the increasing magnitude of the conversation surrounding it is enough to constitute an issue. \n\tIn conclusion, societal influences have a huge impact on personal values, beliefs, perceptions, and ideas. Social media is a new way that this has been occurring over the last ~25 years. Social media is the perfect tool for spreading misinformation over a large audience. This is why it is so important to acknowledge, identify, and fight the spread of fake news, other misleading propaganda and inaccurate information. To the naked eye, it might seem as though fake news is easy to avoid and will not become a huge problem. However, based on the research, fake news is not always as easy to reject as one might expect. As a society, we need to learn to be cautious among the constant flood of information that we are being exposed to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nAllen, J., Howland, B., Mobius, M., Rothschild, D., & Watts, D.

        "text": "Sociology 105\n12 February 2021\nThe Expected Gender Roles\n\tUnknowingly, there are numerous expectations and standards that men and women incessantly face in society just because of their gender. There are unspoken rules implemented that women and men follow to \u2018fit in\u2019 with their community, if these rules aren\u2019t followed, those men and women are seen as outcasts. Within society, genders have roles. Men are supposed to be dominant, to be superior, while women are supposed to be inferior to men. Fortunately, in the 19th and 20th century, a concept known as feminism, rose. Feminism is a political movement in which the goals are to reduce the stigma of gender roles.\n\tIn regard to gender and sexism, gender differs because it is a set of roles put in place through the collective consciousness. Sexism is biologically based; sex differentiates men and women based off of physical features. Interestingly enough, author of \u201cWomen as Other\u201d, Simone de Beauvoir, illustrates the roles that women should play in society. She emphasizes the differences anatomically between men and women. Men view women as \u2018obstacles\u2019, as their \u2018other\u2019 because of their anatomical parts. Men are expected to be of authority because they are built to be stronger, forcing women to be submissive, to live in their shadow. Women were not expected to speak up, they were expected to follow society\u2019s idealism of gender roles. Simone de Beauvoir validates the argument that gender is just assigned rules thought up through the collective consciousness. \n\tSimilarly to Simone de Beauvoir, Naomi Wolf, author of \u201cBeauty Myth\u201d speaks about how women should behave. Just like de Beauvoir\u2019s argument that men should be assertive, women were expected to not only act a certain way but look a certain way. Although there was a rise of women empowerment in this timeframe, Wolf illustrates the negative mental illnesses that women of this century faced. Women were expected to be beautiful, to be youthful, and thin. In the 1840s, the first nude photograph of a prostitute emerged. This photograph was of a woman considered \u2018beautiful\u2019, which resulted in society\u2019s women striving to look like the woman in the photograph. Wolf highlights the increase in cosmetic surgeries, eating disorders, consumer spending, and pornography during this timeframe because of how intense the yearn to be beautiful was for women. \n\tFortunately, despite the gender roles implemented in this century, feminism and reproductive rights came to surface giving more freedom to both genders. Feminism forces people to have a broader perspective on gender roles, to challenge the negative stigmas. This movement enabled women to have more rights and freedom within society. Reproductive Rights gave women the power to control their own body. Even though there is still a prominent stigma with how genders should behave, look, or act within society, society is slowly becoming more progressive.  ",

        "text": "Hegemonic Masculinity - Reflection Essay\n\nWhat does it mean to be a woman in America, or what does it mean to be a member of the LGBT community? To put it another way, what does it mean to be considered unequal to the ordinary male? In America, gender roles and stereotypes are often founded on taught actions and conditions that are used to give one another authority. Despite the fact that American ideals are built on a patriarchal controlling position of men, it causes men to be more prejudiced against particular groups of people, displaying hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity is clinging to life in a way that feminine and heteronormative values aren't. Many people, on the other hand, see a common ground between homosexuality and femininity, putting persons who fall into any of these categories in a major inherent deficiency.\nWomen, like others who belong to various sexually oriented groups, are more likely to be considered as permanent outsiders. For a variety of reasons, gay men constitute a special risk to hegemonic masculinity. To compensate for their lack of masculinity, gay men frequently surround themselves with a female presence in mitigate negative opinions toward their sexuality. They represent a threat to the average male by demonstrating their dominance over women. Men are \"protective othering\" in response to a threat to hegemonic masculinity. Men care to remove themselves from anything that devalues their own identity and collective consciousness.\nIn my own personal experience, I had overheard constant discussions and a noticeable obsession with \"fraternities and frat parties\" when I arrived at UNCW for my first year. Of course, any female going to college is thrilled to meet a massive amount of people and to put the high school boy image everyone all had in their heads to the test. I was drawn to the problem of hypermasculinity in fraternities as an exaggerated organization of men. As a woman who demonstrates many loving and sensitive traits it would be an interesting mix. So, when I attended to my first frat party with my new college mates, it commenced right away.\nAfter dollishly getting ready for hours to impress a group of strangers we had never met, my friends and I ordered an Uber. When we arrived, there were five older college boys in front of the house, seated on filthy lawn chairs. All five of them stood up as we approached in a group of four. That was the first thing that caught my eye; they were exerting their control, and it reminded me of castle guards. They assessed our \"beauty\" by looking at all of us up and down, then turned around and talked for a few seconds. My friends and I stood there, uneasy but curiously anxiously anticipating these boys' approval. One of the boys asked for my friend's phone number and asked if she wanted a drink, but she refused, and the boy gave her an odd and disturbed expression. With an irritated tone, he welcomed everyone except her\u00a0to the event. We certainly couldn't go without her, so we left the party. \"Don't ever come back,\" one of the boys said as we walked away.\t\nThis particular incident reminded me strongly of Simone de Beauvoir's Woman as Other. These males had no regard for us because their parties were exclusively female. They needed us more than we needed them, in order to establish a position of condescending service. They encouraged us to have a great time, but they really wanted us to be grateful for their approval, and in doing so, they conceptualized women's subordination in this brief encounter. Furthermore, in that situation, our bodies were the only thing that defined us. Because we individualized ourselves in a position of power by saying no, we were perceived as an inconvenience. We were portrayed as the Other because he was the Subject, the Absolute.\u00a0We were firm and distinctive, and then\u00a0we were viewed as inessential since men are viewed as virtues, while we, as women, were merely seen as pillars in their party fantasies.\nOf course, I'd been to a lot of other parties like this, and when I stepped inside, I saw a lot of girls standing around waiting for men's approval to have a nice time. The next example, which demonstrated hegemonic masculinity's anti-homosexual bias, touched near to home. In a similar situation, one of my best friends at UNCW who is gay asked if he could join us for a frat party one night. We made the decision to give it a shot. All boys are welcome to attend these gatherings only one week out of the year, at the start of the semester, even if they are not members of a fraternity.\nWe reasoned that our friend would enjoy himself and would be able to spend time with us girls. When 7 of my friends and I arrived, including my gay friend, we approached the boys, and a similar, but even more heated situation ensued. The boys rose up and looked about, wondering, \"What is this?\" referring to my friend, who was dressed in girl shorts and a cropped t-shirt. My friend, who was too shocked to speak, simply let it go. As we began to walk in, some of the boys began to come at us, forcing my friend away. He informed us that individuals like him are not allowed to attend these events. We asked several questions and tried to come up with a solution.\nPeople like him, the boys continued, pull the females away from the very premise of the gathering. In this instance, their self-assurance and aggressiveness told us that any conventional values they held could not be shattered by someone who did not fit the stereotype. We were also thrown out of this fraternity as a result of this.\nAs discussed in the paper \"Doing Gender,\" many of the social expectations of \"sex\" related to this circumstance in a perplexing way. Our biological differences, which in this case were purely physical, identify our sex. If there are 100 straight boys and one gay boy, they should be treated equally. However, homosexuals do not seem to behave in the same way or have the same societal standards that heterosexual boys appear to perceive as acceptable to their institutions in the area of behaving as expected.\nCollege boys, in my opinion, are predicated on hegemonic masculinity. In a weak position, this concept might be seen as a marginalized version of what it is to be a man from a social standpoint. The fact that this idea is articulated for a single gender of male demonstrates how Zimmerman and West revere \"Doing Gender.\" Hegemonic masculinity is a historical idea, and how we shape gender shapes social structures in the same way that the scenarios I discussed previously in this paper do. It is hypothesized in this essay that I fell into the trap of promoting toxic masculinity. I was willing to participate in activities that are\u00a0well-known for demonstrating my own oppression and surface-level prejudice towards my gender, as well as others I care about who didn't fit into the stereotype of this concept. When hegemonic masculinity is clearly produced, males are complicit in the physical\u00a0rewards of women's subordination through a fantasy of a place and time in which they have authority. What women want is dependent on what men can supply, and men's acceptance and enjoyment of having a system of servitude is what keeps them on the margins. \nTo conclude, the argument provided in this study discusses what Brett Strout observed in his work \"In or Out\" for the reproduction of toxic masculinity. Similarly, males who exhibit the characteristic are able to shame others in order to express their compliance and avoid engaging in \"feminine\" activities in public. As one of my examples and personal stories reveals, certain masculinities in this culture \"find masculine femininity in homosexuality and then use it to discipline masculinity\"(Stoudt, 2006). Even if it's in jest, from Stoudt\u2019s article, a man who calls someone a \"faggot\" or refers to someone as \"gay\"\u00a0conveys that he isn't, establishing his innate privileged masculinity by subduing and ostracizing another's masculine identity. It can be frowned upon and against the norm to be gay. After witnessing how effortlessly misogynistic or homophobic remarks elicit embarrassment and avoidance, I know can look at oppressive situations of homophobic and anti-feministic as something I do not want to contribute to; not giving men the ego they want so badly. \n",

We get up every day and stick to a routine; most individuals work like clockwork and don't recognize the drawbacks. Similarly, advances in A1 systems have led to predictions that our lives would one day be governed by algorithms; many individuals do not see this as a problem, while others do. Both Harari and Durkhiem are concerned with A1 systems and how people will react to something new.\n\tHarari discusses the growing problem of A1 systems, the strength of algorithms, and how they dominate our life in his book 21 lessons for the 21st century. While we currently have control over our daily lives, this may not be the case in the future. An algorithm would control our life, telling us things like \"how to react in a breakup,\" \"when to smile,\" and other things. While this may help our world function more smoothly, we would lose the very thing that makes us human: our emotions. Everyone should not react the same way to a split; some people may cry, while others may be fine, and still others may become enraged; but, this should be a personal choice, not one dictated by a system that does not know you. A1 systems are already invading our lives through different aspects. Many people often will say \u201cmy phone is spying on me\u201d while it definitely is not in the way most people assume it is in a small aspect. Each website you go onto tracks your searches; such as amazon if you were searching for a rug you are more likely to start seeing ads for rugs than anything else because companies know you are more likely to buy that than something else. With the growing problem of A1 jobs are effected too. Harari says that not having a job right now may be beneficial in the long run. Because we don't know what the \"work market\" will look like in 2050, not having a job for a while may be beneficial. According to Harari, and as we all know, technical advancements and electronic takeover are destined to replace many manual jobs with \"robots.\" So, if you don't know what career you want or what to commit to in the long run, it's best to avoid committing to something that will no longer require people in 10 years, and you'll have wasted time and money on something you won't be able to pursue.\n\tDurkheim wrote that people feel better when they are in groups, and when they all agree upon the same thing. He concluded that \u201csociety exists because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other\u201d (Cole, Nicki Lisa, Ph.D).This is how many social standards are established; if one person believes something and the rest of the group agrees, it appears to be more acceptable because the entire group agrees. This could be advantageous to A1 systems in both good and bad ways; it could help everyone embrace the takeover of A1 while also helping everyone reject it. A1 has a lot of advantages, but it also has a lot of disadvantages. Many people in society say things like \"we shouldn't let technology dictate our life,\" and we should really listen to them. Allowing A1 to control our life would be giving up the very thing that makes each of us unique, akin to surrendering our freedom. What freedom do you really have if you can't make decisions for yourself in your daily life? When a parent or sibling dies, or when you get your favorite dish, an algorithm can't predict how you'll feel because these events are unique every time. You wouldn't respond the same way to every breakup, so there's no reason for an algorithm to know because you don't.\n\t",

It is seen through commercials, television shows, school, and other institutions in our society; however, it is not always depicted correctly. There are myths about our perception of class ingrained in our collective consciousness, that we may not even be aware of.\u00a0\n\tAlthough the middle class is a term used commonly in society, the opposite ends of the class spectrum do not use the term \u2018class\u2019 as often. In Class In America, Mantsios discusses how the middle class in America does not occupy most of the nation's wealth. This is misconstrued in society because most of the commercials on television advertise towards the nation's middle class, which leads us to believe that the middle class has a large portion of money that is increasing, but it is actually decreasing. A large portion of Americans fall under this category; however, the upper class obtains the largest amount of money in our society. Domhoff discusses, in The Class Domination Theory of Power, that the upper class holds a dominant amount of power, although the United States is a democratic society. As a society, we have believed that since we have free speech and can vote and have rights that we are all equal; however, Domhoff emphasized the fact that the upper class possessed much more power in practical terms, because they have more revenue into the federal government and the corporations that rule the country.\u00a0\n\tClass is a term that can make people feel uncomfortable because as a society we all want to feel equal. There are differences shown in the media and in our society as a whole that affect our collective consciousness about how we view the impact of class in society. We must address the reality of the situations in order to convey change and stand for equal rights. \n\n\n\t",

        "text": "Sociology 101 \n12 April 2021 \nEssay Brief 10\nPolitics has become such an essential power that controls society. Politics organizes each community so that there is organization. Without organization, there would be chaos. However, politics has become competitive, especially between differing countries. Harari discusses the terrorism in his book, 21 Lessons for the 21 Century. The goal of terrorism is to change a political situation by conducting fear in a country\u2019s enemy. Terrorism is ruthless and destructive. Terrorism threatens the heart of each society, the government. Government stems from politics. Society places the government on a high pedestal of importance. This stems from the collective conscious. The collective representation of government is authority, control, and law-making. Harari\u2019s description of terrorism is emphasized because of differing collective representations of politics between countries.\n\tHarari describes the impact terrorism has to each society. For each country under attack of terrorism, threats to security and safety become a pressing issue. Each country has to scramble for resources to protect themselves from terrorism. Terrorism occurs due to differing collective conscious representations. Each society runs their government differently which, consequently, can cause a rift. This rift can become so evident that terrorism arises.\n\tIt is important to understand the collective conscious to understand why issues like terrorism occurs. The collective conscious shapes society\u2019s views, norms, expectations, and more. Each society is different, and differing opinions can often clash causing a disagreement or altercation. This can sometimes lead to terrorism which is often alarming and threatening towards the safety of the society being under attack. ",

        "text": "Lilly Calogero\nSOC 105-001\n18 October 2021\nFirst Reflection Essay\n\tAre men and women truly equal in America? Although it may appear so when considering the country\u2019s laws, the social power structure and culture that exists gives men a big advantage over women. In essentially every profession in America, women make less money than men. Despite women being far more likely to have a higher educational degree than their male counterparts, women on average make 80 cents to each dollar paid to men. There are many initiatives and state-level policies that are trying to combat this problem, but the root of it lies in the societal view of women and how their value is determined. In western society, women\u2019s value is generally based more off their appearances than their achievements. They are expected to fit into a mold based off stereotypes perpetuated by men.\n\tSince women are often judged based on their appearance, they are subjected to stereotypical beauty standards created by men. To gain back their power, women must oppose the beauty myth and use their traits that are considered \u2018weak\u2019 to overcome the male-enforced stereotypes. \n\tI am a lifeguard at a pool, and I have been told that I look weak, so people often assume that I am not very good at my job. Despite what people say, I believe that I am competent, and I believe that I determine my own worth. To give some background, there are two managers at my work, Megan, and Marco. I have also been working there for multiple years. When Megan is managing, she just asks me to do various jobs around the pool because she knows that I can handle it. She even had me teach the new lifeguards how to vacuum at the beginning of last summer. However, I started noticing that whenever Marco was working, he favored the boys. He would always make comments about the girls\u2019 capabilities. We have to carry stacks of chairs across the pool deck every Thursday, so he used to get upset when only girls were scheduled for that shift, saying things such as, \u201cI wish the guys were here\u201d or \u201cWe would have had this done in 10 minutes if there were no girls working\u201d. \n\tOne day when I was working, Marco asked me to finish vacuuming the pool. I vacuumed the whole pool, then one of my guy friends who was also working came over. He said that Marco told him to come help me take out the vacuum because he did not think that I could do it myself. My friend tried to convince him that I was capable enough to take it out, but he still thought that I needed the help. Later, my friend told me that our manager was making jokes about me to the other guards and saying that I was probably too dumb to understand them. Not only was he questioning my physical capabilities, but he was also degrading my intellect. Now that I think back on the summer, it was not an isolated event. Every time that Marco asked me to sweep under the pavilion, he would come with me and watch me to make sure I was doing it right. He would even take the broom and dustpan out of my hands and show me what he thought was the \u2018right\u2019 way to sweep. Another girl that I work with tried to defend my abilities to Marco, but she took it too far and ended up calling him a \u201ccunt\u201d. Our boss is also a white male, so he trusts Marco\u2019s opinion over everyone else. Knowing this, he used it to his advantage and threatened to get my friend fired. Since then, everyone else has been scared to defend themselves or their friends to him.\n\tIn an attempt to resolve our problems with Marco, my friends and I talked to the other manager, Megan, one day about how he was making us feel. We told her that he would belittle us in front of the other lifeguards and make sexist remarks. My friend even confided in her about how he tried to have her fired for standing up to him. Megan, having never experienced this side of him or heard about what was happening, was very surprised. She told us that our descriptions do not fit into her experiences with him and that we should not let what he says get in our heads. While it may seem like she was trying to silence our experiences, she was just protecting herself. Since she was offered the position as manager, no one on the board has shown her any respect, and they do not think that she is competent enough to run the pool without help. So, the culture of men having power over women is perpetuated throughout the whole chain of command at the pool.\n\tNaomi Wolf explains why women are judged based on their appearance as the beauty myth, \u201ca social construct that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon to combat female advancement\u201d (Wolf 1). The idea that a woman\u2019s identity must be based on their beauty puts women in a competition with each other, so they are unable to form a community. The only way for women to gain more power is for them to realize that they are being suppressed, come together for a common cause, and stand up against the male-enforced beauty standard. However, it is not possible if women are constantly in competition. This structure keeps men in power and creates a specific beauty standard that is controlled by them. Although women often play into this standard, the beauty myth is a product of men\u2019s institutions and the power they hold, not what women believe. \nThe idea that men are expected to be strong and not show emotions is at the root of the concept of hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity is when a man portrays stereotypical masculine traits that fit into the cultural norms. For example, men are expected to be strong, be the \u2018bread-winner\u2019 for their family and take care of women. These are all stereotypes that people often associate with males, especially \u2018many men\u2019. When society validates these beliefs, then it gives men a more dominant social role, and further suppresses women. This form of masculinity is often portrayed in the media as the ideal traits of a man. The setting that we were raised in also affects how we participate in these misconceptions. Someone who grew up in a homogenous environment, or one that lacks diversity and encourages one specific set of beliefs, would be more attune to certain stereotypes because they were never exposed to opposing ideas. If a male was raised in an environment where he was surrounded by other rich, white men and was exposed to media that also enforces the same rhetoric, then he would be much more inclined to believe it. \nI often feel like I play into the stereotypes that go along with the beauty myth because my physical appearance is consistent with the conventional beauty standard in America. Therefore, people often make assumptions that I am not smart or that I am not strong enough to do my job. My manager used this beauty myth to justify his opinion that I need help completing tasks that require physical strength or other skills. When my manager made a male lifeguard help me with vacuuming, a physical task that I had done countless times before, his thinking coincided with hegemonic masculinity. He believed that a woman was supposed to be weak and need a big, stronger man to help her. He also Along with this, Marco judged my intellect based on my appearance, so he thought that I was too dumb to know how to sweep. If he did not buy into the beauty myth, then he would have a similar mindset to Megan, so he would just give me tasks to do without supervision. \nThe environment at my pool is an example of a homogeneous environment. The community is almost entirely made up of white families, and most of them are in the upper-middle class. Therefore, the members of the board, my managers, and the people who supervise the pool are also of that socioeconomic and racial status. Since they are generally not exposed to diverse ideas, their beliefs are encouraged by everyone in their community. The board is comprised almost entirely of men, except for one or two women, but the women do not hold any power. Their beliefs are never challenged, so they can continue to do what they want. Their ideas are also perpetuated in the way that the pool runs. This explains why they treat Megan in the way they do. Although she is the manager and Marco is the assistant manager, the board members tell Marco important information about the pool instead of her. They also only trust him with repairs to the pool and solving problems. Marco also perpetuates their beliefs. He knows that since he is a white male, the board and our supervisors favor him. That\u2019s why he can say what he wants and if anyone threatens him, he knows that he can easily get them fired. Essentially, his actions are supported by the homogenous community at the pool and by the stereotypical traits of hegemonic masculinity.\nWomen are often forced into beauty standards that were created by men to keep their power, and these standards are often encouraged by their surroundings. I saw this play out in the way the male manager treated me compared to how the female manager treated me as well as in the standards that are created in the male-dominated, predominantly white community. So, how can we change the standard to make the workplace equal for both men and women? Standing up to the men who oppress us is a start, but it would make more of an impact by talking to their superiors. Although there are many equal opportunity plans being started, they do not account for the microaggressions and bias against women in various workplaces. Creating government-endorsed initiatives to change these conditions is a step that can be taken. However, these are just ideas. The biggest way to create change in one person\u2019s life is to not buy into the hegemonic masculinity and beauty myth stereotypes that engulf society today.\n\nWorks Cited\nWolf, Naomi.

        "text": "Lilly Calogero\nSOC 105-001\n29 November 2021\nSocial Constructs in Modern-Day Society\nDo all sociologists interpret social constructs such as religion and racism in similar ways? Since these topics can be abstract and there are many ways of viewing them, sociologists often disagree. However, they also agree on the implications of some of these social institutions. In Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, he explores many different problems which he sees to be the most relevant for today\u2019s dynamic society. In this essay, I will specifically be focusing on his chapters about religion and immigration. I plan to compare them with a piece from \u00c9mile Durkheim and one by Patricia Hill Collins. \nReligion is a topic that many sociologists have explored. They try to determine why religion was a unifier, specifically in primeval societies. They also explore the trajectory that religion took and how it came to play the role it does today. \u00c9mile Durkheim is a French sociologist from the late 19th century-early 20th century who is considered to be one of the founders of modern-day sociology. In one of his papers, The Cultural Logic of Collective Representations, he explored how religion was developed. His main argument to explain the development of religion is that it was a way to unify groups of similar people to form a collective consciousness. Collective consciousness is an idea developed by \u00c9mile Durkheim and is defined as, \u201ca group or society\u2019s commonly shared fundamental beliefs, customs, norms, and values\u201d (Bell). \n\tDurkheim talks about how religion was essential to societies forming because they needed something to believe in. When societies were first forming, they revolved entirely around religion. In the collective consciousness, the ideas or beliefs that are unique to a certain group are called the collective representations. They help differentiate people\u2019s identities. Since religion became the foundation of these collective consciousnesses, all of the collective representations in each society were tied to the religion that they believed in. Durkheim argues that without religion, society would not exist, and he believes that religion is essential for its functioning. He says that the collective consciousness of a group provides the group members with stability. When someone is surrounded with people who have similar beliefs, then they feel supported, so it is easier for them to see these beliefs as the truth. Religion became the foundation for all the important social institutions within a society, so Durkheim\u2019s main idea when writing this piece is that society and religion are heavily intertwined. \nIn the chapter about religion, Yuval Noah Harari discusses the uses of religion in the past versus the present. He acknowledges that religion used to play a big part in society, but its hold on people\u2019s lives has loosened since it is not relevant to important aspects of life such as medicine, science, and economics. In the past, when people\u2019s lives revolved around religion, it did control these fields. However, as knowledge adapts and we learn more about the world around us, religion becomes increasingly insignificant. In short, Harari\u2019s argument is that although religion still has the power to unify and divide people, it is no longer necessary for our sense of community nor for us to develop as a society. He asserts that religion is essentially worthless in today\u2019s society.\nAlthough they have different takes on religion, both authors make good points. Durkheim focuses on the past and why religion came to play such an important role while Harari explores the present functions of religion. Harari makes good points about why religion is not as important and does not have as much power over people\u2019s lives, but it seems like he allows some of his biases to seep into his writing. He calls religion a problem and says that it cannot be part of the solution. While some religious practices are problematic and have the tendency to ostracize people, they still have a way of gathering people together. In the midst of tragedy and despair, many people turn to the gods they believe in for hope. Most religious rituals include an aspect of community, or they bring people together, so I would argue that the positive impact religion has on people\u2019s lives outweighs the negatives. This is not to disregard the negative experiences that people have had with religion. Instead, it is to offer a more neutral view that considers multiple perspectives. \n\tOne topic that was discussed in class is racism and how people are treated based on their unchangeable characteristics. Patricia Hill Collins wrote The Matrix of Domination. In it, she explained how people are either oppressed or oppressors based on their situation. She also argues how people can exist in both of these positions depending on the system of oppression. For example, a black man could be oppressed because of his race, but also be an oppressor because of his gender. She argues that the way people experience oppression and fit into the matrix of domination is very fluid and is subject to changes. The systemic level that racism functions on is one of the main factors in how the dominant group maintains control. On this level, social institutions such as schools or churches will only expose people to the ideas of their group, and they encourage thinking that coincides with their own. These institutions also require people who are not in the dominant group to be submissive, and they discourage any media that challenges their rhetoric. This essentially means that the dominant group often uses its power to continually oppress the submissive group.\n\tThe chapter that Harari wrote on immigration ties in well with Collins\u2019 argument. He talks about how people are treated differently in various cultures because of their appearance. He uses immigration as the primary example of this and goes into multiple debates surrounding this issue. The debates primarily revolve around immigrants assimilating to a country. For example, how much should immigrants have to assimilate. Or, at what point have they fully assimilated and can then be considered citizens? The anti-immigrant side argues that immigrants should have to assimilate to all aspects of European culture, but they also believe that Europe should not let in too many immigrants for fear that they are intolerant. They say that their society cannot manage an abundance of illiberal people. Some will even go as far to say that national community is the most important European value, so immigrants should go as far as to change their culture. This is where the debate of when someone fully assimilates comes into play. There still lies the question of what extent do immigrants need to go to if they want to become full citizens of a country. Some would argue that they have to change everything about themselves and their beliefs while the pro-immigration side would favor a faster acceptance. Nonetheless, it still takes a long time for immigrants to be considered a part of society instead of outsiders, and are they really ever fully accepted by the people they are surrounded by?\nHe concludes this chapter by discussing the switch from racism to culturism and how they are similar yet different forms of oppression. Historically, racism was more biologically based, so people were treated differently because of their DNA and their physical appearance, but it has evolved to be more a reflection on the places they are from. Harari says that the degrading comments people make about people of color are more about their culture instead of their biology. This is how the term culturism came to be. Since there is so much variation between cultures, they are the root of the differences in humans. He also discusses how their standing in a country change how they are treated. Regardless of political party, people often find immigrants to be a threat. Not only are they seen as outsiders, but many people also believe that they came to take something from them. Despite there being no real evidence to support this claim, it still instills a negative attitude toward immigrants. When immigrants are portrayed as a threat or as the other, then citizens of the country are more likely to react badly when encountering them. It also subjects immigrants to higher rates of racism. \nCollins\u2019 theory that someone can be an oppressor, oppressed, or function on both levels depending on the situation can be applied to immigration. Although Harari and Collins do not have the exact same argument in their writings, their ideas are complementary. On one hand, Collins talks about the different levels that racism can exist on, and she discusses the implications of the institution that is perpetuating the racism. On the other hand, I would argue that Harari uses immigration as an example of the different functions of racism. Instead of directly stating how immigrants suffer from the racist ideas and actions that are perpetuated against them, he describes the tension surrounding immigration and discusses the effects of it. His explanation of culturism, or modern-day racism that focuses more on a person\u2019s culture than their biology, directly correlates to Collins\u2019 theory. For example, if a Muslim man immigrated to England, then he would most likely face hate, exclusion, and oppression from the people who live there. Alternatively, if an American man immigrated to somewhere with high populations of Muslims in the Middle East, he would be seen as a threat and untrustworthy. The Muslim man would then occupy the position of an oppressor instead of the oppressed. Therefore, one person could be both oppressed and an oppressor depending on the situation.\nWhether religion is still important or has become a trivial institution is something that sociologists could debate. There is strong evidence for it being essential in the past, but Harari believes that the past is where it should stay. For this reason, Harari and Durkheim\u2019s arguments are contradictory. However, the one concept that most sociologists can agree on is racism and that it is still a problem on a global scale. Both Harari and Collins give examples of how it is still present and creates injustices for the oppressed, but neither offers a solution. Their arguments have the same basis, so they are complimentary. All three writers offered good support for their conclusion and make a strong argument in favor of their position. Now, it is up to us to determine what we see to be the truth.\n\t\nWorks Cited\nBell, Kenton. \u201cCollective Consciousness Definition.\u201d Open Education Sociology Dictionary, \n2013, https://sociologydictionary.org/collective-consciousness/.\nCollins, Patricia Hill.

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n29 November 2021\nMeaningless Work and Corporate-Owned Data: Comparing and Contrasting Marxist Theory with Yuval Harari\u2019s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century\n\tMovies Back to the Future, Meet the Robinsons, and Robots portray the future as a utopia, perhaps because history has only credited humans\u2019 capacity for evolution.  Today, however, society takes a rather ominous path toward the future.  Karl Marx\u2019s theory of estranged labor has proven itself in 2021, and it will continue to do so until capitalism is replaced by an economic system that prioritizes workers\u2019 needs.  Frighteningly, advanced technology legitimizes a need for employee relations.  Modern technology also restricts humans to a livelihood that, under capitalism, is no different from that of feudal serfs.  As an increasing number of humans\u2019 basic needs become monetized, our self-autonomy is slowly undermined by large corporations.  Who is to say that humans\u2019 future selves will not be at executives\u2019 mercy through technological forces?  When assessing economic circumstances of the present, which match Marx\u2019s theory of estranged labor, one may predict a future that aligns with Yuval Harari\u2019s corporate-owned, employee-harming outlook.\nWith the exception of humans, every species may thrive only in a particular environment.  Humans are unique from other species because our imaginations enable us to adapt to a variety of environments.  Humans are the universe\u2019s most valuable resource, and our advanced capabilities materialize our thoughts.  Historically, humans have used our imaginations to establish civilizations, create industry, and discover agriculture, all of which further our chances of survival.  In accordance with Marx, labor perverts unique activity by enforcing production of goods that are unnecessary for humans\u2019 longevity.  Coinciding with Marxist theory, the market assigns monetary value to all things, and human energy is commodified.  Prior to the 1800s, which is when the Enlightenment birthed liberalism, labor was interpreted as a means to survive.  A village that existed in Europe at this time consumed all of its produced goods.  For instance, a farmer who lived in 18th century Europe may have supplied his village\u2019s most popular \u201crestaurant\u201d with ingredients.  In return, he/she paid no amount for food.  Ultimately, relationships incentivized villagers to labor, and villagers knew who consumed their goods.  Pre-modern societies are reproduced using exchange of goods, services, and resources that occurs within a singular net.  Market societies are reproduced using goods that are provided to consumers by third parties.  Markets are third parties that estrange laborers from their \u201cfruits\u201d.  Thus, the theory of estranged labor is born.\n\tMFW, also known as meaningful work, weakens alienation of labor.  To lose a job in effect of technological advancement is rather beneficial, according to author Yuval Harari.  In his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari argues that if humans lose jobs to algorithms, then we may be able to pursue meaningful careers.  Specifically, \u201closing our jobs to algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing\u201d, for doing so may motivate us to pursue our interests.  Chapter 2 of 21 Lessons for the 21st Century warns humans of a future composed of \u201cartificial\u201d labor.  In such a future, scientists will have studied the brain enough to influence formation of algorithms.  Resolutely, artificial intelligence will possess abilities of determining various situations\u2019 maximum outcomes, driving, and performing surgery.  In addition to pursuing meaningful careers, humans may generate little human errors, should A.I. overtake job markets.  Human error includes car crashes, doctor shortages, and employee discrimination.  \n\tAlthough Harari acknowledges in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century that fears of an A.I. uprising \u201chave never materialized\u201d, his opinion that for an algorithm to overtake one\u2019s job is a blessing contradicts the theory of estranged labor.  Harari insists that an economic safety net would replace the market, if A.I. supplants manual labor.  Marx warns that capitalism separates property-owners from propertyless workers.  Present-day consumers are often unable to afford their own products, justifying need for an economic safety net.  Contrarily, A.I. requires management.  Harari\u2019s image of a picturesque, jobless universe is inspiring, particularly as we exist in modern society.  Still, an economic safety net does not answer to those who manage algorithms.  Marx states in Estranged Labor that all functions of human survival begin with human action.  Again, Harari contradicts the theory of estranged labor by disregarding concern for employees\u2019 invulnerability.  Sure, opportunity for humans to pursue meaningful work at welfare\u2019s hands may still be attained, but what economic system will replace capitalism so that those operating A.I. are better-recognized for their labor?\n\tEstranged Labor spotlights dangers of a society that is too immersed in the market to repair itself should humans become alienated from their customers.  Class is a large aspect of Marx\u2019s worry that for-profit labor removes propertyless workers from property-owners.  Today, the \u201cfree market\u201d controls every aspect of humans\u2019 lives between Europe and the United States.  However, a low class would be impossible without neoliberalism, specifically.  As evidenced by the Occupy Wall Street movement, which began in 2011, every-day Americans are upset with the top 1 percent of earners.  Marxist fears of an unchecked class have finally boiled over.  Previously, for-profit labor was means to an end; initial uprisings indicated boundaries past which executives were not permitted to travel.  Coupled with ministries of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Margaret Thatcher, 1970s stagflation ushered an era of corporate dominance, which has yet to conclude. \n\tToday, humans\u2019 lives are not only affected by modern technology, but also entangled with it.  As modern society is defined by corporate-dominated markets, large corporations may only gain power over humans.  Chapter 4 of 21 Lessons for the 21st Century concerns data, which is presently used by Facebook, Google, and Amazon to procure customers.  Technology advances so quickly that humans may not regulate distribution of data before large corporations obtain such data.  Deregulation of the market may empower large corporations to withhold data by dominating competitors.  Already, gas, internet, and other necessities have been monopolized.  Harari cites the \u201cliberal story\u201d as a primary reason for humans\u2019 inevitable imprisoning livelihoods.  Full ownership of incomprehensible\u2014yet fundamental\u2014technology by large corporations is certain to dictate societal function.  \n\tIn his research, Marx uncannily predicts the future.  The market is not only a method of obtaining land, but also a necessity for modern society\u2019s functioning. Between McCarthyism, Reaganomics, and general conservatism, many civilians of the global West cannot remove the \u201cfree market\u201d from freedom.  Advanced technology, which Harari alludes to when reprimanding large corporations, is no less than a part of this functioning.  Wherein algorithms outline increasing parts of humans\u2019 lives, large corporations face no difficulty controlling narratives.  Harari states that, in the future, algorithms will decide what humans eat, where we buy groceries, and how we commute to work.  To predict humans\u2019 every-day decisions, algorithms retain data that they have already collected.  Were private companies to access human data, much of which they already do, humans would have no choice but to pay for actions that we currently consider to be second nature.  In a technology-dominated future, the top 1 percent of earners may oversee not certain resources, but humans\u2019 entire lives.  Neoliberalism has managed to negatively alter human existence, but one aspect of life that it has not affected is technology.  Humans already live in generally dire economic conditions, considering numerous recessions that have crashed markets regarding housing, employment, and other goods.  Contrarily, there once stood a time at which point working-class citizens had stake in their job benefits.  Fortunately, a similar time still remains for technology.  Yes, Silicon Valley is composed of privately-owned enterprises.  Simultaneously, Apple, Google, and Facebook are unique from State Farm, Food Lion, and CVS Pharmacy.  Before humans are unable to determine reality from virtuality, we must reevaluate our economic system.  In Harari\u2019s words, \u201cit is unclear what [private ownership of data] actually means\u201d.  A government-run system of distribution regarding data may sound unappealing, but so does big business\u2019 control of humans\u2019 lives.  It is entirely possible for data-dependent functions to \u201cstagflate\u201d and charge more than that which laborers earn.\n\t2050 may be defined by A.I. doctors and data-generated algorithms.  Dissimilarly, 2050 will still include markets, which\u2014if we aren\u2019t careful\u2014may decide limits of human decision regarding technologically composed activity.  If A.I. executes future labor, then working-class people might foresee rather nongreen pastures, for even robots must be upkeeped.  Even with presence of a safety net, those who operate A.I. find themselves ever-trapped in meaningless pursuits.  Likewise, one can assume that large corporations will eventually control human data.  If algorithms that humans currently use are updated for buying groceries, dining out, and transportation, then large corporations will be first to decide at which restaurants we eat, what groceries we buy, and how we commute.  The future toward which humans are headed is a terrifying one.  Technology advances too quickly for modern society to match.  If humans refuse to rework the world\u2019s dominant economic system, then we will seal our own fates. ",

        "text": "Goffman and Mead\nThe Dynamic Concept of Self\n3034\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead\u2019s concept of the self is a challenge to itself as according to Mead the self is not inherent to itself and is its own unique set of characteristics and experiences that separate itself from one\u2019s body. The Self vs Body is one of the key aspects of his philosophy as the Self relies on the physical aspect while the latter does not rely on the former. With the body being the propulsion or machine for the self, it is not unlike how the body would be the stage for Erving Goffman\u2019s principles. \nOne of the most important aspects of the self in Mead\u2019s eye is similar to Cooley\u2019s \u201clooking glass self\u201d where in individuals imagine how others perceive them and adjust their self-concept, accordingly, usually based on the specific group. Though this pails in comparison to his primary point of language or communication, individuals learn to interpret symbols and meanings within their cultural context, contributing to the ongoing development of the self. The fluidity of oneself, according to Mead, arises from the continuous negotiation and reinterpretation of social experiences, shaping our identities and our lifespan. Though the main issues of Mead\u2019s philosophy come in that he hardly provides any notion of how emotions and conflict shape one\u2019s personality rather than focusing on the language and group setting even so his persuasive argument is compelling.\nThis is all further supported by Erving Goffman's dramaturgical approach which complements Mead's ideas by portraying social life as something akin to a theatrical performance with how we as the actors play roles in settings, people must navigate through life\u2019s many different social situations by portraying aspects of their identity deemed appropriate for the context such as how one would seem studious and observant around a teacher while acting more of oneself and relaxed around close friends at recess. This self-presentation shows how fluid oneself, as individuals actively move to conform to societal expectations while navigating the intricate social stage though, this is not so true in every case as the stage is divided into a fore-and-back where one shows different levels of who they truly are. \nOne of the faults of Goffman\u2019s view as it does not account for how social media affects one\u2019s performance as people fake their backstage view and spew out a highly curated slop of a front stage with social media not being a truly collective work where people can build and react off one another as they would. Making this an empty husk of oneself.\nA Proper example of how these two concepts would work in synchronization in the average day would be this; Imagine being a new employee joining a corporate team. In the initial weeks, they would engage with colleagues and superiors. Through this one would begin to see how others view them and with feedback, this contributes to the self-concept. If their ideas are well-received, and they successfully integrate they may act one way or if it is seen negatively, they will adjust their behavior to fit in more appropriately. While Goffman\u2019s work would be more suited for day-to-day actions this comes up most apparently within meetings as one has to manage to appear professional, choosing what and when to say things. This strategic self-presentation is influenced by the desire to be perceived as competent, cooperative, and aligned with organizational goals. The dynamic nature reflects the fluidity of the self as individuals adapt their self to fit the social concept circle setting.\nThe combination of Mead and Goffman's perspectives on identity construction shows a comprehensive understanding of the ever-changing social-based nature of the self. The ongoing negotiation of social experiences, as emphasized by Mead, intertwines with Goffman's theatrical metaphor, illustrating the performative aspect of one\u2019s identifiable self within society. Though these two both add they also have many negative spots as they imply that we as people have no identity or self perfectly set in stone, nor do they explain what factors properly affect and cause the growth and change in our identities throughout our life as mentioned earlier with how mead mostly overlooks emotions and conflict within one\u2019s personal life.\n",
