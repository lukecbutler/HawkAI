Most people at some point in their life have changed something about themselves in order to fit in. We grow up and think that we must fit our specific gender stereotypes. As a girl you are expected to wear pink, play with dolls, wear dresses, and have long hair. If you want to play a sport and you\u2019re a girl, its suggested that you either dance or cheerlead. We shouldn\u2019t be conditioned at such a young age that certain styles, colors, interests, or athletics fall into gender categories.\n\tUp until high school, I was what was known as a \u201ctomboy\u201d. I grew up on a farm, so I enjoyed activities such as hunting, fishing, and riding four-wheelers. Part of these hobbies came from being part of a family of all boys. All of my cousins were boys, and I also had a younger brother. We would play different sports like basketball, football, and baseball. I was always just hanging out with my family and never understood these activities weren\u2019t typically participated in by girls. \n\tNot only did I act the part of a tomboy, I also dressed like it. I was always wearing baggy t-shirts and athletic shorts. Dresses, skirts, and sandals were not part of my wardrobe. Additionally, I wouldn\u2019t wear colors such as pink or purple. All of my clothes were either blue, black, or grey. Many of my mom\u2019s friends or my family members would always tell her to dress me in pink so I would look more like a girl. However, my mom didn\u2019t like pink or bright colors anyways, so I never had to worry about that.\n\tWhen I got to high school, I was districted to a school in the city. I decided that I needed to switch up my look so I would fit in. I changed out my typical tomboy look for skirts and crop tops. I even dyed my hair blonde and started growing it out. It worked and I made friends quickly, but it didn\u2019t really feel like me. I wanted to get involved with something that actually felt true to my interests, so I tried out and made the women\u2019s basketball team at my high school. It was the best decision I made but I was quickly brought back down again. All of the guys on the men\u2019s team would tell us that women\u2019s basketball isn\u2019t a real sport. I was the team captain so I tried to help the other girls get past these comments, however I couldn\u2019t really get over them myself. I started to question if they were right. Additionally, some of the guys in my grade would tell me that I was \u201ctoo pretty to play basketball,\u201d and that I should do something that was \u201cmore girly\u201d such as cheerleading. Even though I loved playing basketball, I ended up quitting my junior year because I was tired of all the remarks about my looks and ability to play a sport as a girl.\n\tCandace West and Don Zimmerman wrote an article titled, \u201cDoing Gender.\u201d It talks about how gender is an ongoing accomplishment in your everyday interactions. Your sex is your biological differences that you were born with. However, your gender is the societal expectation of you based on your sex. Therefore, doing gender is behaving as expected based on your biological identifiers.\n\tNaomi Wolf wrote about the \u201cBeauty Myth.\u201d The beauty myth is essentially an idea that is designed to control women by telling them that their identity is in their beauty. This makes women become more obsessed with how they look than pursuing a strong leadership role. This makes it hard for women to come together and make a community since they aren\u2019t striving for power together. It is a tactic used by men and political authorities to keep women virtually submissive. They want women to believe that a woman is more desirable if she is domesticated and beautiful.\n\tWhen I was growing up, I wasn\u2019t \u201cdoing gender\u201d to societies standards. Society has set standards for girls and boys. Girls are told in order to be a real girl you need to have long hair, wear dresses, paint your fingernails, wear makeup. They are also told to be emotional and subservient. As a boy you are told to have short hair, wear suits, and not to wear makeup. They are told to be stoic and dominate. If you don\u2019t follow these expectations, then you are told you aren\u2019t a real girl or boy. As a child I was typically taking part in activities and wearing clothes that were typically reserved for boys. This is why I was always called a tomboy. However, I never wasn\u2019t a real girl. These were activities that I truly enjoyed. We shouldn\u2019t grow up and be told by society that we can\u2019t dress a certain way or do certain activities because of our sex. We shouldn\u2019t have to prove that we are a real girl or boy by doing gender. These expectations keep people from being their true authentic self.\n\tWhen I was in high school, I played directly into the beauty myth. I became obsessed with how others viewed me. I wanted everyone to like me so bad that I changed myself to the point where I didn\u2019t recognize myself anymore. I changed my hair color because I thought it would make me more desirable. Additionally, when my ability to play basketball was doubted, I didn\u2019t try to stand up for myself. I would just brush it off when I could have done more about it. Even when I was told I shouldn\u2019t play basketball because I didn\u2019t look the part, I didn\u2019t even try to disagree. It all led me to quitting. This is exactly what Wolf meant when she talks about how women won\u2019t be able to form a community because they become more obsessed with their beauty than their fight for power.\n\tSociety tries to control women in multiple ways. They try to question their beauty so that they won\u2019t try to fight for more power. They also try to convince women that they aren\u2019t a true woman if they participate in activities or dress different than the norm. This became apparent to me throughout my whole life. The beauty myth along with doing gender have forced me multiple times to adjust my identity in order to fit societies standards. We need to change societies expectations that a woman\u2019s identity is in her beauty to hinder her drive for power. We also need to teach the younger generations that they can participate in any sport, activity, and dress however they want. Just because a girl doesn\u2019t want to wear skirts and dresses doesn\u2019t make them any less of a real girl. We also need to teach society as a whole not to judge others based on their appearance. The number of times I was told I should dress differently eventually did drive me to changing my appearance. We shouldn\u2019t be convinced to change our appearance to fit societies standards. I am a real woman no matter what activities I choose to participate in and how I decide to dress.\n\t",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n4/27/2021\nAlienation in the Workplace and how it Affects a Worker.\nHave you ever been unsatisfied with your work? Feel as though your job doesn\u2019t stimulate your creativity? Does your job give you a sense of purpose? These feelings are not uncommon with in the workplace, and many people around the world experience alienation within their place of work. Karl Marx, a German sociologist, explained these feelings and the concept of alienation in \u201cEstranged Labor\u201d. \nKarl Marx believed that the feeling of alienation comes from a person labor. He describes four different types of alienation and why this alienation is experienced by the worker. What Karl Marx does not explain however is how this alienation effects the worker outside of their workplace. How it affects their social life and their mental wellbeing. After further research into this matter, it is clear that alienation within the workplace has a distinct negative effect on a person life outside of the workplace. \nThe four different types of alienation that Karl Marx describes are the separation the worker has to the product, the estrangement that the worker feels during the production process, alienation from the human identity, and finally alienation of man to man.\u00a0These feelings of alienation all stem from different things but they all occur within the workplace, and they all have a negative effect on the worker. A study titled \u201cThe effects of work alienation on organizational commitment, work effort, and work-to-family enrichment\u201d focused on the powerlessness and the meaninglessness aspect of alienation. Karl Marx's concept and theory of alienation is predominantly in regard to the worker, and it focuses on how the capitalist production process is what makes the worker feel alienated. Marx believed that alienation is the result of being within a society where there are social classes, and that wage labor resulted in a feeling of alienation. Marx also believed that our society was divided into two classes, the first one being capitalist, and the second one being the laborer\u2019s. He argued that labor is an essential part to a man's core concept of himself. When a worker creates something, he puts himself into that object, but alienation occurs because the production of that object is not his. As the worker creates more this feeling of alienation grows. In our economy work is about surviving, and we do not work for the sake of ourselves. For the labor, their work is not driven from the core concept of themselves but instead driven by survival. The alienation that occurs when a worker feels alienated from the human identity, or as Marx called it \"species being\u201d, occurs when the labor feels separated from their basic humanity. Referring to the idea that labor is the essential part of a man's core identity, Marx believed that we are what we create. Due to capitalism, private ownership, and the division of labor however a worker has no ownership over his creations. This division between the capitalist and the labor creates another form of alienation between man and man. Due to the labor producing goods for others it separates the worker from the person who truly \"owns\" the goods being produced. Therefore, creating a divide between man and their fellow man.\nThe purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of work elimination on organizational commitment, work effort, and work to family enrichment. They had three hypotheses that they studied the first one is that work alienation will be negatively related to passive performance at work, the second one is that work alienation will be negatively related to active performance at work, and the third and final one is that work alienation will be negatively related to life outside of work. The way that they test their hypotheses was by using surveys collected among a national sample of midwives in the Netherlands. They chose to do midwives because of their growing scarcity as well as the fact that most midwives are the primary caregivers within their families. This study in particular is important because it recognizes that work and family are no longer separate life demands but that they are becoming increasingly related, therefore also recognizing that work has an effect on life at home. The three things that the study was looking at is organizational commitment, work effort, and work to family enrichment. Organizational commitment is the emotional feeling that an employee has towards the organization that they are employed to, workers who experienced this are more likely to stay with the organization because they are able to identify with it.\u00a0 This is also an important feeling for the worker to experience because it\u00a0positively influences the employees\u2019 health and their well-being. Work effort is when employee extends their work beyond what is written in their employment contract. Feelings of powerlessness or meaninglessness can affect the performance of a workers work effort.\u00a0 The two aspects of alienation, powerlessness, and meaninglessness are negatively related to organizational commitment and work effort. This is due to the fact that having control over the way that work is done is likely to increase organizational commitment and work effort within the worker. Available studies show that there is a negative relationship between meaninglessness and job performance. A lot of them also show that meaninglessness is negatively related to a worker\u2019s commitment to their work. Meaninglessness and job satisfaction as well as work effort also have a negative relationship. The study found that work powerlessness and meaninglessness both have a significant negative influence on organizational commitment of workers. This means that when workers feel that their work has no meaning and when they have no power over their work, they are less committed to their job or their employer. The data of the study also shows that when the worker feels that they have no meaning in their work or when they feel powerless at work, they are less willing to put effort into their jobs. Finally, the study showed that work meaninglessness does in fact have a negative effect on work family relationships, it found that when the worker felt that their work was not important, they also experienced less positivity in their family life.\nAnother study titled \"on the personal consequences of alienation in work\" aimed to study the consequences of feeling alienated at work. They conducted the study by examining a random sample that consisted of working males in a Swedish community. The consequences that are usually allotted to work alienation consist of hostility, political withdraw, a sense of powerlessness, and the seeking of a status. Alienation can be considered the wrongful denial of a man to his potential. This concept connects to mark's idea that a man's labor is his core concept of self. When a man is consistently working in an environment or a job that is unfulfilling it can have very serious social affects. The consequences of unfulfilling labor do not just consist of the refusal of a personal fulfilment but also consists of trouble within a person's political life, as well as their social life and many other aspects outside of the workplace. Alienation within the workplace not only affects a worker at their job but also at social events, political affairs, and their home life as well. The theory is that the effect of alienation in the workplace trickles into a person's social and personal life therefore affecting those aspects as well. The feeling of powerlessness also has a negative effect on the worker's mental well-being. This study in particular raises questions about what can alleviate the feeling of alienation. Things such as becoming a member the worker's occupation, friendships with fellow workers, especially those who work face to face. The friendship idea in particular has been found to help alleviate the feelings of being alienated within the workplace. This study in particular found that there was little evidence that length alienated work to being less engaged in political and social matters. However, the study also raised interesting questions about what factors could have played a role in these findings. Like whether or not outside friendships contributed to the worker's well-being.\u00a0\nWhile looking further into Karl Marx\u2019s theory of alienation I realized that it is still a very prevalent issue to this day, and that lots of people are studying the effect that it has on workers who experience it. Marx contributed a worker\u2019s creations or their work to their sense of purpose, explaining that a man\u2019s core concept of self was what he creates. Feeling as though one has no control or ownership over their creations and their work leads to alienation. This occurs because of the separation between the two classes the laborer, and the capitalist. The laborer has no ownership over what they create therefore creating a divided between the worker and their work. As human beings we find purpose in our work, and we work for our own self-fulfillment, but in today\u2019s society most people have to work for survival. Working only because you have to in order to survive does not give a sense of fulfillment and leads to the separation between the worker and their job. Feelings of alienation contribute and led to feelings powerlessness and meaninglessness within and outside of a person\u2019s job. Even though the studies had different results in regards to how alienation affects the worker outside of the workforce, they both found that it did have some type of affect. The first study found that those who felt a feeling of meaninglessness within their jobs, also felt less positivity within their home life. That there was a direct negative correlation between feelings of alienation to negative feelings outside of work. Feelings of alienation also affect the workers work effort, when they feel as though their job has no meaning, they are less willing to put effort into their jobs. Alienation not only effects a person while at work but also outside of their job, such as in their home life and their social lives. The second study found that friendships within the workplace can help to lessen or alleviate feelings of alienation, especially when the friends are those who work closely with you. In conclusion alienation within the workplace has a negative effect on personal aspects of a worker\u2019s life, such as their family and social lives. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSORCES \n\nTummers, L.G. & Den Dulk, L.

He mentions, at one point, that in 2100 the rich could have the ability to be better than those who don\u2019t have money because with the way technology is advancing, people will be able to buy themselves \u201cenhanced bodies and brains.\u201d The gap between the rich and the poor will continue to widen, and it won\u2019t be able to close again. Domhoff discusses the ways of the upper class and how they are the groups that work in the higher up areas, such as corporations and federal government positions. Working people don\u2019t hold power in this world because they don\u2019t have money. They work to survive and buy groceries so they can eat. The working class, in 2100 won\u2019t have the ability to buy themselves enhanced bodies and brains. They are already set apart by the upper class, so imagining a world where the gap is bridged even wider is intimidating already. ",

        "text": "\tCuauhtemoc Glaindo\n10/18/20201\nEver since I was young I have had something of an identity crisis. My mother is a second generation American, but she grew up learning Spanish as her first language and visited Mexico often. My father grew up in Mexico as well and moved to America when he married my mother. I was born in Ohio and learned Spanish as my first language, but around the time I got to middle school I never knew whether to call myself an American or a Mexican - in my head both of my parents were Mexicans, so it made sense for me to be Mexican. At the same time I grew up in American culture, spoke English and had forgotten most of my Spanish, and though I knew more about Mexican culture than the average American it did not feel like my own culture. This caused me to not know who I was internally, which made me close myself off. As I grew older though I started to look laterally and came to realize more that who I am is not something that can be easily attributed to any one label. \n\tWhen I look back to my hometown of Medina, Ohio there are many things that I\u2019m reminded about. It was a nice little town and I still get nostalgic thinking back to the little downtown area that I and my class went to for a field trip and my mom picked me up from, or thinking about the time we showed our cousins around our picturesque house, complete with a big field, a farmhouse, woods, and our neighbors even had a pond. I paint this picture to show that my memories of my hometown are significant mainly due to imagery and family. It is not as though I lacked interaction outside of that - I went to preschool, Sunday school, I interacted with other children my age, but I don\u2019t remember it - despite all that I remember my family mostly. This is due to the disconnect I felt with my peers, as I had lost a sense of myself.\n\tIn sociology there are a few concepts of the self that can be used to explain this situation, with the first of these being \u201cThe Self and its Selves,\u201d from William James. James explains that each self is made up of four different constituents, those being the material, social, spiritual selves and then the pure ego. The material self is how we tie our physical traits and possessions into our character - we take pride in how we look, how we dress and the conditions we keep things because that is a reflection of us. The social self is how we want to be perceived in different social situations by our peers, and there are as many social selves as there are interactions that we have with others. The spiritual self is the self that we can see through introspection, and informs the first two, while the pure ego is the \u201csoul\u201d of a person, cannot really be seen, but informs completely the spiritual self. Though this can be used to explain my situation, there are two facets of the self that get left out, as the two integral selves for my childhood are social self and spiritual self.\n\tI grew up with my family - which sounds obvious, but contrasts with the fact that I did not grow up with my peers. When I was with my family I did not need to explain my social self as it was evident through all the years we had spent together. They knew how to pronounce my name, my nickname, what I liked and did not like, etc. When I was with new peers not only did I need to build a new relationship but there was already a need to explain - how to pronounce my name, my nickname, why it was the way it was, etc. It is an odd thing to have shaped me the way it has, but my full name (and even nickname) marked me as \u201cdifferent\u201d from the beginning. It is not everyday that you meet a \u201cCuauhtemoc,\u201d (let alone a \u201cTemo\u201d) and people always had questions on how to pronounce both of these since I was young. This did not bother me when I was very young - kids asked questions to each other all the time. As this continued into elementary school though I started to question myself - why is it that every stranger was so interested in this name of mine? It was a very exotic name obviously, but then this got me to examine my spiritual self, which I had no need to do before as I was surrounded by family. This introspection led to a realization - I can not speak Spanish anymore, and had not been able to for quite some time.\n\tWhen I realized that I, a Mexican kid, could not speak Spanish, it caused much cognitive dissonance in my head and I started questioning myself. \u201cWhat good is being a Mexican if I can\u2019t even speak Spanish? Doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m not anything - not American because of my parents, but not Mexican either?\u201d I asked this and many other questions in my head constantly, and the answer I came to was that I was no longer Mexican - I had thrown it away whether I liked it or not, and that is my punishment for doing so. Very melodramatic, but it was a truly fundamental shift to how I perceived myself. I continued to not need to explain myself to my siblings as our dynamic did not change, but the way I saw myself changed, which goes into the second sociological concept of self: the looking glass self.\n\tJames Cooley is the mind behind the looking glass self and the best way to describe it is \u201cperceived perception.\u201d Cooley states that everyone acts the way that they think others perceive them. So if I as a student believe that a teacher thinks I am a disruptive student, I am more likely to act like a disruptive student. It is a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts that is also built off of the perception of others that we have. To go back to the example, not only do I think that the teacher has a preconceived notion about me, but that notion is based on how I perceive that teacher as well - maybe I make a few jokes in class and the teacher always tells me to stop disrupting. I then think the teacher is a stick in the mud, which informs how I imagine the teacher's perception. This concept of the looking glass self came into play during this time when I started thinking about who I was, but it does explain the situation on its own.\n\tBecause growing up so many people had questions and I was already having doubts about myself I inadvertently started using the looking glass self, which started to inform my behavior. I saw myself as an outsider or outcast to my peers; my name obviously marked me as different yet at the same time I had fair skin and looked Caucasian, and I had no command of the Spanish language. Too light for the Hispanics, too exotic for the Caucasians I thought. And I continued to think that for a long time, until around my high school years when I learned to do nothing differently except the one thing that got me into that position - think.\n\tAs I slowly got friends and started to look around to my peers, I started to notice that labels told you about as many letters as they were. My older brother could be considered a jock, but he graduated with above a 4.0 gpa and liked to sing. My best friend in middle school was a \u201cgeek,\u201d but the only geeky thing about him was that he liked computers and computer games - other than that he was not much of a geek. This caused a change in how I decided to perceive people, not by their social self but by their internal self. The pure ego as mentioned before for lack of a better term is the soul of someone. And though it informs every other part of yourself, it is not something that can be probed or introspected on - all we can see are the effects, that being the other facets of self. As I got older I started to see my peers not based off of their material or social selves, but instead their internal self. George Mead developed a concept of self that is very similar to James\u2019, that being the \u201cI and Me.\u201d\n\tThe I and Me is a simple concept - the \u201cI\u201d is the internal self ( like the spiritual self and pure ego), whereas the \u201cme\u201d is the social self (material and social selves). The \u201cI\u201d reacts to stimuli, and the \u201cme\u201d filters these through what it has learned of social situations. This concept more holistically explain my younger self - there was a change in how my \u201cI\u201d was viewed, and that lead to a loss in what the \u201cme\u201d should do, causing me to close myself off. As I grew older though I realized that each individual's social selves tend to be unique to them, and that a label of any kind rarely does anyone \u201cself\u201d justice. So how did I start to view myself? Although I was American and Hispanic, above both of those things I was me. Not entirely in the Mead sense - I simply put my labels beneath my social and internal self. I wrongly believed that race or ethnicity informed more of my internal self than it really did. Ultimately, I am me. I could give you any label under the sun, but that would only ever scratch the surface.\n\tIn closing, my exotic name in conjunction with the realization of my lack of Spanish led to me to not know my internal self, and this loss of internal self jeopardized my social self. As I grew older and looked laterally though I noticed that labels are purely superficial, which put less of a burden on my own identity. Sometimes I wish I could tell my younger self and that I could change the way I had grown up - but then I would not be who I am today. This version of me could only exist by going through what I did and growing up the way I did. Changing things would mean changing me, and there is no guarantee it would be for the better.",

        "text": "3625\nFinal Paper\nWhy does an intelligent woman have to be an unattractive woman? Why does an unintelligent woman have to be an attractive woman? Society has told women that men prefer a pretty girl to a smart girl. We have become so superficial as to judge someone on their appearance rather than their qualities. Women spend thousands to look and feel beautiful from cosmetics and plastic surgery. Now more than ever, our social media is full of half-naked skinny women glowing with a fresh tan and smiling with perfect white teeth. Do we ever ask ourselves; I wonder what her story is or what her aspirations in life are? No, the women who see that image will go to the gym or starve themselves, get a spray tan, and whiten their teeth. The men will awe the beautiful woman and think about how perfect she is. Over the years, women have faced yet another oppressing technique masked in competition with one another to be desirable; the beauty myth. Women have become so infatuated with how they look the matter of education, genuine connection, and identity are disregarded. Men have given themselves the power to mentally abuse women and persuade them into believing if they sit still and look pretty, they will be feminine and desired. Women with the intelligence and bravery to stand up for their rights disrupt males' institutional power, thus being cast as undesired and masculine. \nA bit of background for relevance; I am a tall, white, skinny, blonde woman. I am also majoring in biomedical engineering, which includes courses filled with mostly men and a few women. Growing up, my parents prioritized my education and taught me about my image's importance. How to carry yourself, which clothes to wear, how to interact with others, and everything a young woman learns. However, they never taught me that men would solely view me as a tall skinny unintelligent blonde. How that young men assume I was in the wrong class because this was Calculus 3, and what business would I have there? How older men would look at me and say, \"You should smile more. It makes you look prettier.\" My life consists of men telling me how I should look, and if I do look that way, I should be content with life. \nOne instance that still resonates with me is an interaction with one of my high school teachers. He asked, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" The most mundane and run-of-the-mill question people even ask it to kindergarteners. I responded with doctor or lawyer because I knew I wanted to have an A-list career. His response was genuinely demoralizing, saying I should lower my standards, maybe be a teacher or a nurse, something that would suit me better. He didn't know I was taking sophomore-level classes in 8th grade; he didn't know I had been on the Honor Roll since kindergarten; and he didn't know I was on the mathlete team. He only saw a pretty face that needed to mold into a category that fits the standard. \nAs a young woman, I fully developed by age 15, which meant my parents needed to warn me of how to dress and carry myself yet again. Always dress to impress, but you must leave things up to the imagination. They failed to mention if you show no skin, you're a prude, but if you show too much skin, you're asking for it. So how do I, as a woman, find my true identity amongst the roadblocks, devaluation of my knowledge, and sexualization of my body? \nNaomi Wolf wrote a piece exposing the beauty myth and evaluating its effect on women. The beauty myth stems from the sexual liberation of women during the industrial revolution after women abandoned the feminine mystique of domesticity. At that point, the only feminine ideology left was beauty, thus creating this intangible idea of impossible standards for women to achieve. This standard, created by men's institutionalized power, pulls women's focus away from political issues such as equality and turns it towards beauty. Women now constantly compare themselves to skinnier, younger, and more developed women. Therefore, according to Wolf, eating disorders have grown exponentially, and cosmetic surgery is the fastest-growing medical specialty. Women will do whatever they can to be the most beautiful, desired, and fit the beauty standard. Have you ever wondered why older women get Botox and plastic surgery to look younger? When someone ages, male or female, they grow wiser, meaning age indicates intelligence. However, women must not be intelligent because they would threaten men's power, making them unattractive to men.\nMen further instill this myth by not dating a girl more intelligent than them because if women were free from this hold, their power would contest men's power considerably. In her paper, Wolf mentions a caricature from 1960 of an \"Ugly Feminist\" which shows a masculine woman smoking a cigar. Society is making women believe that if they portray themselves as unintelligent, conceal their feelings, and don't cause any disturbance in male dominance; they are considered beautiful and feminine. On the other hand, if you are portraying intelligence and awareness of the oppression of women, you threaten male dominance; therefore, you are considered ugly and masculine. We must ask the question, why do women allow this to happen to them? The answer is more complex than just ignoring it because women are now permanently psychologically affected by the beauty myth. The only way for women to break free from the myth is to see the world through a different lens. Something challenging to achieve when our economy relies on the income from cosmetic companies resulting in the standardized beautiful woman plastered on every magazine, television, and billboard. \nIf I were to look back on my personal experiences, I could understand why people view an unattractive woman as intelligent and why people view an attractive woman as unintelligent. Brilliant women stand to disrupt the male institutions and challenge their dominance. In turn, men accuse them of being ugly because men fear the power of a woman free from the shackles of the beauty myth. If women gain complete confidence and trust their knowledge, it will carry them much further than the makeup on their faces and the Botox in their cheeks. \nMy fellow male classmates don't think I am capable because I am intelligent and beautiful, which they are intimidated by. My high school teacher attempted to discourage me because he was worried a witty woman would achieve more remarkable accomplishments than him, thus hindering his dominance. The problem is not the woman but the insecure men attempting to oppress women to feel better about themselves. My identity is not how many men like how I look but the intelligence and connections I possess. \nSense of humor is another excellent example of the beauty myth. Men's sense of humor, when determining if they find a woman funny or not, is based on whether or not the woman laughs at his joke. On the other hand, women would choose a good sense of humor if the male told a good joke. In elementary school, the teacher would ask, \"Are there any strong boys here that can help me carry this?\" Notice how the teacher never asked if any strong girls could help because women should sit still and look pretty. In our society, instances of the beauty myth range in all age groups. \nWomen need to see that men don't say derogatory things to them because they are true but because they are worried women will become as powerful as them, if not more powerful. Women can be conventionally beautiful and just as intelligent as someone who isn't conventionally beautiful. The same goes for a woman who isn't considered a classic beauty and can be just as unintelligent as a woman who is a classic beauty. Standardized beauty is another way for men to approve or disapprove of a woman's behavior and intelligence. Women are not less because they are women but because female beauty is used as a political weapon to oppress them.\n",

        "text": "Soc 101\n2/22/2021\nSecond Graded Essay \nIn Peggy McIntosh\u2019s article titled White Privilege she explains that she noticed how men often are unaware or don\u2019t admit they are more privileged than women. When she became aware of this, she often became aware of the privilege that white people have over people of color, and how white people are often unaware of this privilege as well. In Mead\u2019s The Self the I and the Me he explains his theory of self and how it relates to a person\u2019s learned behaviors and their conception of self. \nPeggy explains that she believes white people are carefully taught not to a acknowledge their privilege. This makes them unaware that they even have it, and only by become aware of it can they do something to change it. In Mead\u2019s theory of self, he explains that the self has two sides, the \u201cme\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cme\u201d represents an individual\u2019s learned behaviors and attitudes as well as their expectations of people. The \u201cI\u201d is a person\u2019s response to others. This helps to further Peggy\u2019s argument because it explains that a white person\u2019s \u201cme\u201d is their learned behavior of not acknowledging their privilege therefore they have no expectation of others to admit their privilege. Once a person becomes aware, they become more inclined to expect others to notice as well. Peggy goes on to say that becoming aware of the privilege will help to change the circumstances surrounding it. \nIn Peggy McIntosh\u2019s article titled White Privilege she speaks about how becoming aware of her white privilege also made her more aware of all the things she was able to do without discrimination. Mead\u2019s theory of self helps to explain why people are often unaware of the \nprivilege that they have. \n\n",

        "text": "The Boy\u2019s Club\nGrowing up and to this day, I might frequently be considered a \u201ctomboy.\u201d A tomboy is a girl who exhibits characteristics associated with masculinity and prefers hanging out with the guys and ditching the \u201cgirly girls.\u201d Why is there a special category for girls who enjoy wearing pants and playing in the mud versus masquerading in pretty dresses as princesses? Society creates neat categories for humans to fit into, and gender is a significant category. However, human beings \u201cdo\u201d their gender in unique ways. So, a person might feel confused or upset if they see an individual who doesn\u2019t automatically fit into their schema for the typical man or woman. Tomboys act outside the bounds of what a typical girl is expected to do. Such behavior tends to be more accepted than identifying as non-binary or transgender; nevertheless, it receives pushback.\nMy neighborhood was full of kids back in elementary school, and we would all hang out together after school and on the weekends. There were more guys than girls, and I was inclined to want to do whatever the boys were doing. I was good friends with the girls, too, but making up dances and playing with barbies did not sound all that appealing to me. I wanted to have nerf gun wars and lightsaber fights and play video games. I don\u2019t know if it was ever an official name that we called ourselves, but the boys and I would always hang out in this storage room at my house called The Boy\u2019s Club. I felt cool because I was the only girl allowed in there (even though it was my house).\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; there were times when I played dress-up and had the stereotypical sleepovers with my girl friends. I never felt like I would rather be a boy, but it felt more comfortable and more like me to hang with the guys. I would wear my hair up in a ponytail, burp like a beer-drunk man, and sit with my legs open (an unladylike position). My mom was not fond of this. I can\u2019t tell you how often she told me to stop doing these things because girls don\u2019t behave like that.\nCandace West and Don Zimmerman examine gender from the lens of a performance or as something human beings are always doing in the context of social interactions. They clearly define the terms sex, sex category, and gender. First, sex is \u201ca determination made through the application of socially agreed upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females\u201d (i.e., genitals at birth or chromosomes; West and Zimmerman 127). Sex may seem as though it is concrete, but there is a myriad of chromosomal typings and physical displays of these typings that can make even sex ambiguous. Second, sex category is \u201cachieved through application of the sex criteria, but in everyday life, categorization is established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one\u2019s membership\u201d as males or females (West and Zimmerman 127). Identifiers such as hair length or body language help others categorize someone as one sex or the other because the sex of a person, or biological characteristics, is not typically readily available for everyone to perceive. One can be categorized as male and be seen as masculine even if a person lacks male sex criteria if their performance of gender is adequate. Gender is \u201cthe activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one\u2019s sex category\u201d (West and Zimmerman 127). Notice that gender is described as an activity that one does and is meant to signify and validate a person\u2019s sex category. These three terms are complex and interconnected and must be analyzed together to understand how someone moves through the world as a gendered being.\nThrough visual clues, one might determine that my sex category is female. This determination is made by my stature, body language, voice, etc. I do not readily display my sex characteristics, but these clues help others visually identify me as a female. However, the way I \u201cdo\u201d gender is ambiguous and depends on the context. West and Zimmerman state that displays of gender are context-dependent. I may perform a more feminine gender or a more masculine gender identity in different social interactions.\nReturning to the neighborhood kids, I performed my gender differently when I was with the Boy\u2019s Club than with the girls. The kids may have perceived my sex category to be female and, thus, I was treated as such, but the way I did my gender depended on the people. I was still feminine when I was with the boys, but I leaned into my more masculine traits when playing with them. Whereas with the girls, I remained more feminine. I roughhoused with the boys and was generally more assertive in this group. I was calm and passive with the girls. The boys accepted me into their group, but I was still a girl, so I couldn\u2019t be hit or teased as much as the guys.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\tAccording to West and Zimmerman, our environment also impacts how we perform gender. We do gender by gathering resources from our surroundings. For example, I may have been doing gender in a more masculine way on the playground with the boys, but if I had to use the bathroom, I would choose between the girl\u2019s and boy\u2019s bathrooms. Due to my sex characteristics and the sex category others perceive me as, I use the bathroom designated by the stick figure with the triangle dress. However, as evident by gender-neutral bathrooms, bathrooms do not need to be separated based on sex characteristics. \u201cGendered\u201d environments such as separate bathrooms reinforce the gender binary, strengthening our socialized schemas. I would be chastised if someone perceived my sex category as a woman and saw me go into the men\u2019s bathroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\tEven before birth, humans are placed into a category. An expecting mother might show an ultrasound picture of her baby boy to her friend, who might say, \u201cwow, he looks like he\u2019s going to grow up to be a big, strong man.\u201d Conversely, if shown an ultrasound picture of a baby girl, the friend might say, \u201cawh, look how cute she is. She\u2019s going to be a heartbreaker.\u201d As far as we know, fetuses are not socialized to perform gender to match their sex category while they\u2019re in the womb; however, around preschool age is when children are taking on their socialized gender identity behaviors. West and Zimmerman discuss how little boys focus on how they affect the world physically and socially via physical strength. Little boys want to interact with the world and get their desired outcomes. In contrast, little girls focus on how they interact with the world via their appearance. They want to fit in by looking how they think little girls should look. This observation matches how I behaved in elementary school with the boys versus the girls. I roughhoused with boys to get what I wanted, and I played dress-up with the girls. I was still socialized as a girl, but, like most children, I didn\u2019t completely follow the rules (no matter how much it annoyed my mom).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\tTomboys are just a tiny exception to the gender binary in Western society. This term is used to designate a girl/woman who acts like a boy/man. Of course, human beings do their gender in various nuanced ways. Some are not born with the sex characteristics that match their gender identity and may identify as transgender. Some may not identify with any gender and describe themselves as non-binary or gender non-conforming. There are many examples of how humans convey their identity in their social interactions, and we must consider this when thinking about how we place people in categories. I\u2019ve received a lot of judgment for being a tomboy, and others who do not strictly adhere to gender roles do too. When we think about gender as a performance and not as something that belongs to us, it takes away the idea that we have to be the thing that people perceive us to be. It is easier said than done to persuade people not to perceive our sex category. However, society can move toward accepting with open minds rather than judging.\n",

        "text": "Battle of the sexes. Male versus female. Man versus woman. A large discussion that seems never-ending. There are many opinions people out there that say a man is better than a woman. There are things that men can do that a woman can\u2019t do. This is true, there are things that a man can do that a woman can\u2019t do, but there are also things that a woman can do that a man cannot. The popular saying when it comes to this is the fact that a woman can have children, but a man cannot. While true, this is not the only example out there. A woman can do a lot but there is a long history where women were seen as the weaker of the sexes. Progress has been made, but there is evidence that shows that women are still being treated unfairly compared to their male counterparts. In this paper, I will discuss the gender roles that women are stereotyped with, which can be seen in relationships, in the workplace, and how these roles are still seen today. \n\nRelationships Between Men and Women\nMen, in relationships, are generally seen as the dominant figure. They are the \u201cman of the house.\u201d Men provide for their families while women are expected to stay home and take care of the children. This is a gender role that is still acknowledged today by many people and religions. Another example is how a man protects a woman, and the woman allows herself to be protected. This can be seen throughout children\u2019s stories of the princess being saved by a prince. Kids learn through these stories at a young age, that women need men to save them from the \u201cbig, bad, and scary things.\u201d They grow up learning these things and go about it by believing they need a man to thrive or by challenging the social norms. \nThis then brings up the point of learned gender roles in a learning community. There has been recent research that shows a focus on the \u201cseparate sphere\u201d model. This is where men are seen as the provider or breadwinners. Women are seen as caretakers. A man\u2019s \u201cdomain\u201d is the workplace while the home is the woman\u2019s. Going back to the children\u2019s stories, a man is expected to save the woman. Men and women in a relationship are expected to look a certain way. Usually, in the dating scene, people make assumptions, and they have ideas as to what a relationship should be like. The man should be taller, older, and they should make the first move. Men get praised for having many sexual partners while women are condemned for doing the same. These stereotypes remain the same. Men are expected to propose marriage and to be taller and older than their female counterparts. Women are expected to listen to their partner and stick to the social gender norms (Yu & Duan, 2021). There are stereotypes for women everywhere, these form at home, at school, and in the workplace.\nHiring and Job Selection\nWhen hiring for a job, hiring committees can often be quite selective. Committees look at achievements, personality, work ethic, and they have to look at geographical locations. They need a person that fits the job, so they look at everything, including relationships. Women are seen as a big part in a family. Because of this gender role, where women prioritize their family, hiring committees are less likely to offer a job to a partnered woman because of the chance of a geographical move. Males and single females were the target audience, instead (Rivera, 2017). \nGender stereotypes have messed with the hiring scene for women because men are depicted as being better at most things than women, so they are the target interviewees. Already, from the start, women are not being considered because they have a family and are in a relationship. They are stereotyped to be family women when that isn\u2019t always the case. Aren\u2019t women allowed to have goal and aspirations? Or does that stop when they have a family? It doesn\u2019t stop. Women dream and they can be ambitious while having a family. A geographical move is a small price to pay for a good working job that they applied for in the first place. \nSexual Harassment in the Workplace\nIn a workplace, women are known to have to put up with more concerning issues than a man. These issues can come in the form of sexual harassment and discrimination. Women are considered to be more vocal about these issues in the recent years. For the most part, women will speak up about what they have been through, but when it comes to a person in a higher-up position committing an act, women are more likely to lose their voice. Sexual harassment has the power to harm the victim\u2019s wellbeing in total. This can affect their physical and mental wellbeing, which is also seen as a problem because women and mental health in a sentence are seen as a bad thing (Foley et al., 2020). Women are seen as being ruled by their hormones and their emotions. They cannot work and have a hard day because they need to give their one hundred percent to keep up with the males in the workplace. \nThen, there is the flexibility and unequal pay aspect where women are known to accept lower pay in exchange for flexibility in their schedule. This adds fuel to the \u201cunequal pay\u201d fire that was built years ago, and that is still a problem today (Cooper et al., 2021). Women, because they were seen as a part of man, and in need of a man, are taught to keep their mouths shut. While this situation has improved today, sexual harassment in the workplace is still a major issue. Unequal pay is a problem in every industry. The music, acting, and sports industry is where we hear about it the most. Female actresses have come out to speak about the fact that they are paid a considerable amount less than their male counterparts. \nWomen\u2019s sports teams are hardly spoken about and there are many problems within the industry when it comes to treating both genders fairly, more than just payment. There was a recent issue that came up involving the WNBA weight room where the women received yoga mats and six pairs of weights, while the men received many workout benches, dumbbells, and bars for their gym. It was considerably larger than the women\u2019s gym (Fernandez, 2021). While men\u2019s sports are considered to be the most popular out of the two, women\u2019s sports are still important and shouldn\u2019t have to be considered less than by the organization. \nGender Roles in Early Childhood \n\u201cDespite their growing presence in the labor force and educational institutions in the last few decades, women remain socially marginalized and underrepresented within, as well as, outside of households in low-income countries (Islam & Asadullah, 2018).\u201d Every year, in many countries, women are married off before they reach adulthood and according to UN Women, one in three women experience a form of physical harassment. Along with this, \u201cthe United Nation\u2019s Girl Education Initiative identified it as one of the five challenges towards achieving gender equality in education. Biased textbook contents not only limit women\u2019s worldviews and career choices, but they also distort their self-image and the image of the opposite gender group.\u201d\u00a0So, women are taught this in \u201cbiased textbooks,\u201d instead of learning that they have the ability to get good jobs and help their families in more ways than one.\nLooking at the situation from an academic standpoint, opinions and ideas differ greatly. In some countries, like the United States, school is encouraged, and girls attend earlier than boys. They feel safe in this place and are able to learn which is said to be easier for women. However, in other countries where traditional thinking is encouraged, \u201cboys need careers and girls need husbands,\u201d which is a type of \u201ctruth\u201d that teachers in schools say in Africa. This way of thinking still being around won\u2019t go away. In some cultures, like the Mexican culture, a woman is told to serve her husband. She makes him food while he works. She washed clothes and cleans the house while he rests from the workday. This is a truth, but it is important to acknowledge that the gender norms develop in early childhood. It comes from school, the television, and from the family that a child is born into. It comes from culture and familiarity.\n\n\nGender Roles in Religion\nReligion is a part of every kid\u2019s life, whether they believe in God, gods, goddesses, divine beings, or nothing. Religion always has something to say about what a woman\u2019s place is. In the Christian bible, a woman\u2019s place is next to her husband. There is a man of the house, a head of household, a man to care and provide for his family. There is a woman to grow the family and care for the children. Women in Buddhism have stricter guidelines than men in their religion. Only men can reach the highest level of spirituality because women were reluctantly given the ability to become ordained. These are guidelines that many traditional religious families follow, and they teach their children who grow up and do the same. Kids learn these gender roles everywhere and this is why women are still being held back from being seen as equal (Salgado, 2015). \nWomen have had it rough. This is seen throughout history and it is still seen today in the world. Men and women are different physically, yes. Men and women have different parts and ways of thinking. There are scientific methods and studies that have proven men are stronger than women. Studies that show women react in different ways to a crying baby than men. This is also the twenty-first century. A female president was almost elected. There is now a female Vice President, the firs ever. History has been made and history will continue to be made. No, women and men aren\u2019t equal, yet. Men and women both have different strengths, but women should not be treated as an extension of a man. Women are not less than men. There are gender roles that are expected of women, but those roles do not have to be followed. \nConclusion\nWomen are told how to act and to know their place. There has been improvement, but equal pay has not been accomplished. Men are still seen as higher up than a woman. There is inequality in the workplace, in relationships, in school, and that is clearly seen today. Women are still seen as the weaker of the two sexes. We can look at Simone de Beauvoir and read her perspective of women being seen as other. We can look to Christianity and Buddhism where woman are subordinate. We can look to school systems where teachers tell kids to know their place. Where woman are seen as obstacles to a man. Where men are sole providers for their families. No matter how many people say that inequality is no longer an issue, there are many situations where women still have to prove their worth to a man. There are still points to be proven and changes to be made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Final Sociology Paper\n3110\nAs we as people get older and there are more generations there are on this earth, the more and more we hear about the rise of mental health issues in people, namely young people. I feel as if there are some bigger reasons for this than just what meets the eye. I feel as if society has been imposing some standards on young people that would make them feel this way, and that could seriously affect their concept of self. I feel as if there are some things that need to be fixed in this society so that people will ultimately be beneficial for people and their mental health.\nAs I was growing up and going through school, we as kids got to see many things that we maybe should not have. Sometimes these were on the news, hearing about all the bad things that were going on in the world. Sometimes it was in our own school, with the near-constant fist fights, people wearing things that are definitely not appropriate for a business-like environment, and even the occasional fight that turns a little more violent than usual. While those things might not have been affecting on people's mental health strongly, the things that really did were the things that were being imposed on everyone. People telling you that you have to do well in school and that your whole life depends on it. Some people gave up on that, however, and decided to just try to be popular at the time, which brought around its own set of stresses. You had to be up to date on everything going on and try to match the fads so that in the eyes of others you seemed \u201ccool.\u201d The atmosphere of the school made it so you felt you had to be good at everything or you were a useless member of society and that is a lot of stress to put on children who are ranging from ages 12 to 18. Then there are the pressures that are put on each gender that seem to be present. For females at any age, it seems from the people I have talked to as if people expect them to be calm collected but at the same time be soft and caring and basically asking them to meet a certain mold. For men it is also a mold just a vastly different mold than the one for women. Men are supposed to be the strong ones who show no emotion and be successful in work even if school was not pushed as hard on some. Basically, the main point I am trying to show is that there is a lot of pressure and stress put on people these days and there is a solid chance that these things a contributing to the seeming rise of mental health issues in this society.\nOne concept that might be applying to this situation is the looking glass self by Charles Cooley. This concept is mainly focusing on this current technological age, and it states that we basically perceive ourselves as we feel like other people in our lives perceive us. A good example of this concept is that if someone perceives that their coworkers think they are a weird and awkward person they might start to become a weird and awkward person. The same is also true for the opposite feelings. This is why it is important as a parent to make your child feel like a certain type of person, normally a nice caring person.\nAnother concept that might apply to this is the concept of the beauty myth by Naomi Wolf and the idea of hegemonic masculinity by Connell. The beauty myth is the concept that women feel that they must adhere to a certain set of unreachable beauty standards, and it is something that controls them. An example of this is that a mother is projecting onto her daughter that she must dress in a certain way to make her appear attractive. The concept of hegemonic masculinity is the concept that men are supposed to be stronger than women and they do this by being aggressive and use violence and they should show no other emotions besides this. The most common example of this concept is that people telling boys that real men do not show emotion and that they should just deal with it.\nAll of the concepts: looking glass self, beauty myth, and hegemonic masculinity all apply to the situation in the second paragraph where it was talked about how there was a lot of pressures and expectations of people that might be leading to an increase in mental health issues in today's society. The concept of looking glass self brings the reason to the table that people might have a poor concept of themselves because of the increase of social media and the need to appeal to people on those social medias and if you feel like people are not liking what they see on that then that might make you feel not liked which would increase the rates on mental health issues. The concept of the beauty myth also brings forward why there might be an increase of mental health issues in women and more particularly younger women. This is because if someone is always telling you that you must dress and fit a mold as a child you might feel as if you are not able to be your own person and develop your own style. Getting rid of this feeling of individuality can make it more likely to feel useless and this may develop into something more serious. Lastly, the concept of hegemonic masculinity brings forward why there might be an increase of mental health challenges in younger men and men in general. This is because being forced to hold in emotions and not show anything can be quite detrimental to one's mental health and the act of holding in emotion could lead to increased rates of mental health problems.\nAs stated throughout the paper it seems to be there is an increase in mental health issues across the United States. I feel, as shown in this paper, that the main reason for this increase is the toxic culture this country has started to develop. Namely the prevalence of beauty myth among women and with the increase of social media this seems to be affecting women more than ever and it is leading to lower self-esteem and more mental health issues. Also, the prevalence of hegemonic masculinity is definitely a contributing factor to the increase of mental health issues among men because the holding in of emotions can be very detrimental. Another contributing factor with the increasing use of social media is the concept of look glass self. This is because if you do not feel like people on social media are not liking you then you may develop a negative view of yourself which is not good for mental health. I feel like these are some really important things that people in the US need to talk about and address, so we do not hurt people unnecessarily and we can together create a happier society that can function well together without bringing each other down.",

        "text": "1011\nSOC-105-007\nSocial Media and The Beauty Myth\n\tMany women are, and most likely will always be, immediately judged based off their physical appearance. This causes an immense amount of pressure that begins to take a toll on women\u2019s social, mental, and emotional wellbeing. To start, I am 22-year-old women living in today\u2019s society, where technology and social media use are at an all time high. With these great inventions unfortunately brings great consequences as well. I have grown up with technology and social media and I have come to realize that it is not the healthiest for me. I have always struggled with fearing I do not live up to standards of beauty and never will. For me, this has always caused some sort of depression and anxiety, that truly does stem from my physical appearance. It may sound clich\u00e9, because a lot of people I know struggle with these issues, but it is something that affects my everyday life, and has for years now. Before taking this class, I did not know that there was such thing as the \u201cbeauty myth,\u201d but after learning more about it, I realized how prevalent it is today, especially with the effects of social media. I, like most people my age, have TikTok and Instagram. I am constantly seeing beautiful women who fit into this beauty standards, but it is hard to separate fake social media filters and reality. The constant exposure I see to this sort of content makes it hard for me to feel confident in myself. I also have a younger sister who is almost 15 years old. I am starting to see some potentially damaging effects that social media has on her and her young friends. I\u2019m sure that these girls feel similarly to how I feel; much pressure to conform to these unrealistic expectations of society. I fear that they will struggle with the same issues I struggle with. These unrealistic expectations can lead to very serious issues such as body dysmorphia, eating disorders, very low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.\n\tIn an attempt to not let myself fall into the trap of social media and the \u201cbeauty myth,\u201d I have tried to distract myself with different things. I have put limits on my social media, to try to limit the amount of time spent on it. I also surround myself with positive people, such as my family and friends. It is important to take care of your own mental health before you worry about anything else. On the contrary, social media has some potential positive aspects to beauty stands that could help young women know their worth and not worry about fitting into the unrealistic standards of beauty in today\u2019s society. When Naomi Wolf wrote her book, it was published in the 1990s, a time before the expansion of social media. Today, women are trying to crush the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d using social media. For example, there are a lot of \u201cbody positive\u201d movements that encourage young women to be comfortable in their own bodies. Many of these advocates use social media to show the many representations beauty has to offer. This in turn, can lead to self-love, healing, and help. \n\tNow, is there a \u201cbeauty myth\u201d for men, even though it was created by them? The short answer is no, not necessarily. Men are held to a certain standard, but not a certain \u201cmyth\u201d or physical standard. For example, men are not supposed to show emotion because this can lead to people thinking of them as weak, but they are expected to be the leader of the household and be strong. A lot of times, if men show emotions, it is considered feminine, but recently, society has started to stray away for this idea. These stereotypes cause men to become subject to toxic masculinity. The term \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d can also be known as hegemonic masculinity, where hegemonic means dominant. This is a legitimate male role in Western society, and it is a practice for men to show superiority against other men and women. Men have intangible standards whereas women have physical standards. This idea of toxic masculinity encourages men to stay cold and dominant to focus on success and prosperity. Women could be considered \u201cproperty\u201d to them, or it may be encouraging men to possess women. This idea then leads more into the idea of men having power over women, therefore oppressing women even further. \n\tThroughout Naomi Wolf\u2019s book, she explains and provides many examples as to why and how women are judge based on the \u201cbeauty myth.\u201d She begins to explain how this myth is composed of emotional distance, politics, finance, and sexual repression. To further explain the point of oppression with women, she states that the beauty myth isn\u2019t about women at all. It is all about men and the institutional power they hold. Western women have always been controlled by ideas and material stereotypes, but I feel that as social media usage has increased, the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d and transformed it. In this perspective, I feel that the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d is still prevalent, if not more, but with the emergence of social media, it may be transforming into a beauty myth that is being reinforced by other women. As much as I hate to admit it, the first thing I tend to notice about a person, especially other women, is there physical beauty and appearance. I think the notion of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d changes a little here because I am not looking to have power over other people, I am simply comparing myself to them. I think this is a natural thing that all people are subject to do.\n\tAfter looking and exploring through a different lens and writing about my own experiences with social media and the \u201cbeauty myth,\u201d I quickly realized that the emergence of social media has increased my negative implications of the \u201cbeauty myth.\u201d With the unrealistic societal expectations, it is hard to be confident in myself, especially when every time I open a social media app, I am bombarded with beautiful with who are \u201csocietally beautiful.\u201d I do think that Naomi Wolf\u2019s idea of the beauty myth has transformed and changed with society. I think that this myth was started by men to have power over women, and I still believe that is the case, but I also believe that this myth is being enforced by other women as well. I don\u2019t think it is trying to be forced in a negative way, but many women are trying to fit into societal norms to fit in with society. This idea of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d pins women against each other in a competitive way, when actually, women need to encourage other women and stand up to the men that oppress them. Social media is a part of life now, and it always will be, so it is important that we find effective ways to keep our generation and generations to come in a positive mindset, so they know that they should not fall into societies trap of \u201cthe beauty myth.\u201d\n\t\n\t",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n28 April 2021\nThe Matrix of Domination During Modern Day\nThe sociological paradigm known as the Matrix of Domination is where many are forced to deal with oppression due to their race, social class, gender, sexual identity, age, and religion. The more you meet, the more you are caught up in the matrix. One could describe the matrix as a spider web if they liked.\n\n(1)Woman + (2)Person of Color + (3)Transgender + (4)18 to 25 years old = Deep Within The Matrix\n\n According to Collins, \u201cThe Matrix of Domination stems from Eurocentric, masculinist thought which are institutions, paradigms, and any elements of the knowledge-validation procedure controlled by white males and whose purpose is to represent a white male standpoint.\u201d\n Before diving deeper into the Matrix of Domination, it is important to discuss Collins\u2019 explanation of the role of black feminist thought. Afrocentric feminist thought rejects additive approaches to oppression by utilizing knowledge to resist domination and empower those dealing with oppression (Collins, 1990). This not only helps shift the way we think about oppression but also allows us to better assess the \u201ctruth\u201d behind many current debates (Collins, 1990). Collins expresses that black feminist thought views the system of oppression as being part of the intense structure of domination. She also states that domination operates by seducing, pressuring, or forcing African American women and other members of subordinated groups to replace individual and cultural ways of knowing with the dominant group\u2019s specialized thought. The author relays that dominant groups aim to do this because they realize that gaining control over this dimension of subordinate group\u2019s lives, simplifies control. This paper will examine how the Matrix of Domination affects minorities by specifically discussing Black Transgender Women, Transgender people of color, and Latina warehouse workers. The more minorities you are a part of, the more predisposed you are to oppression. \nNow, onto one of the topics at hand; the Matrix of Domination and Black Transgender Women. Black Transgender Women are probably the best \u201cagents of knowledge\u201d because they receive the least privilege, meaning that they have dealt with all aspects of the matrix for the longest time. During the Summer of 2020, six black transgender women under the age of thirty-two were killed over a period of nine days. As stated by Foreisteire, \u201c...hate crimes against transgender and gender non-conforming individuals have been on the rise for years, with the number of murders in 2020 already almost surpassing that of 2019. Of the 26 victims so far this year and the 27 victims last year, the majority have been Black transgender women under the age of 30.\u201d The reasons that Black Transgender women are killed at such crazy rates is due to the mix of homophobia, transphobia, sexism, homophobia, etc. which are ideas that stem from Eurocentric, masculinist thought (Foreisteire, 2020). \nNavigating Community Institutions: Black Transgender Women's Experiences in Schools, the Criminal Justice System, and Churches, written by Louis F. Graham, further displays the oppression that Black Transgender Women face. This study aims to bring attention to the issue by collecting the life histories of ten black transgender women between eighteen and twenty-four years old, all living in Detroit, Michigan (Graham, 2014). It explores the institutional violence, harassment, and discrimination they face, specifically at schools, churches, and within the criminal justice system (Graham, 2020). \nSome statistics that shed the light on the negativity this specific group of people face are explained within this article. For example, Graham quotes that, \u201cIn 2001, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLESN) conducted a School Climate Survey and found that 82 % of LGBT students reported being the victim of sexual, physical, or verbal harassment; over 90 % indicated that they regularly heard anti-LGBT comments at school; and nearly 25 % heard these comments from school personnel (Bauer, 2002).\u201d Also, the bullying that occurs in school towards transgender people is so intense that it leads many to develop numerous mood disorders and suicidal ideations. The mood disorders one can develop from the environment Black Transgender Women endure can range from Major Depressive Disorder to Anxiety Disorder to Panic Disorder and more.\nWhen one feels like this or is getting bullied, they are often told by a counselor or friend to turn to their community for support but when it comes to Transgender people of color, even that may not be an option. The majority of the time, Transgender people of color are not accepted by their own cultures because how they identify goes against their cultures\u2019 set of beliefs. In turn, they feel alone and isolated. \nAnother big issue Transgender people of color have to deal with is fetishization. Transgender people of color\u2019s experiences of sexual objectification: Locating sexual objectification within a matrix of domination, written by Flores, Watson, Allen, Ford, Serpe, Choo, and Ferrel, interviewed fifteen Transgender people of color about their experiences with sexual objectification (Flores, Watson, Allen, Ford, Serpe, Choo, & Ferrel, 2018). The authors state that, \u201cresults suggested participants\u2019 sexual objectification experiences were shaped by the intersections of cissexism, sexism, and racism, and that participants experienced various levels of privilege and oppression based on their specific identities,\u201d which once again, ties in with the Eurocentric, masculinist thought (Flores, Watson, Allen, Ford, Serpe, Choo, & Ferrel, 2018).  It is well known that Transgender people of color face more unequal treatment, assault (whether it be physical or sexual, and harassment than any other group whether it be White Transgender people, Lesbian or Gay people, etc. These findings also show that \u201cTPOC, especially TPOC women may be at-risk for oppression-based victimization (Flores, Watson, Allen, Ford, Serpe, Choo, & Ferrel, 2018).\u201d\nAs a result, when one takes a look at the everyday lives of Transgender people of color or specifically, Black Transgender Women, they see exactly how dominated these people are. Due to ideas created hundreds of years ago of what is socially \u201ccorrect\u201d or what \u201cshould be\u201d, these people are predisposed to overall, poor quality of life just because of others\u2019 opinions and actions. \nAnother example is Desperate Fortunes: Latina Warehouse Workers in the \"Matrix of Domination\", written by Danielle J. Lindemann and Teresa M. Boyer, applies Collins theory to data from focus groups with immigrant Latina \u201cperma-temp\u201d warehouse workers.  A \u201cperma-temp\u201d is a temporary employee who works for an extended period for a single staffing client. One main topic of this article and the one above is Intersectionality Theory. Basically, \u201cWomen of color who were involved with these movements understood that race, class, gender, and sexuality could not be explored and addressed separately; rather these categories are part and parcel of interlocking systems of oppression (Lindemann & Boyer, 2019)\u201d. The study states that if one, \u201c...apply(ies) insights from intersectionality theory to the topic of migrant organizing, and contends that class, race, and gender are collectively key to understanding the labor market experiences of immigrant women.\u201d This is basically the \u201cmatrix\u201d that leaves those controlled. \nAnother issue that these factory women have to deal with is harassment within the work environment. This article tells of one story where the managers and supervisors see these women as objects and sexual beings and how they were only hired if they met the supervisors\u2019 \u201clevel of desirability\u201d. Not only did they have to deal with that, but they had to deal with pay inequality as well.  \nIf one looks over all of the information provided, one can draw the conclusion that the further into the matrix one falls, the more they seem \u201cpredisposed\u201d to oppression. If you are a woman, you may have to deal with not being paid the same amount as a man for the same job when you have the same qualification. If you are a woman of color, you are even more likely to not be chosen for a job compared to a white man, a man of color, or a white woman. The pattern becomes worse and worse the farther you fall into the matrix. It seems that if one is not a straight, white male, the fewer opportunities you will be given and the higher the chances of you being bullied, assaulted, harassed, treated unfairly, etc. \nThis leads to my last important point. America prides itself, saying that it is a country of \u201cequal opportunity for all of its citizens\u201d but, how can that statement be true if you are born as or identify as any one of the categories that isn\u2019t a straight, white male? The answer is simple: It\u2019s false. You can not control what you are or how you feel and it is unfair that one may have to deal with extreme forces of oppression because of things out of their control. \nIn conclusion, the more minorities you are a part of, the more predisposed you are to oppression. Black Transgender Women are the best \u201cagents of knowledge\u201d because of how far they are in the matrix and because of all the dangers they experience and face. Latina factory workers are forced to deal with terrible work environments and are harassed simply because of who they are. This is all one sad, modern-day, multi-century truth.\n Take a look at the news and read the titles: the Black Lives Matter movement; the Black Trans Lives Matter movement; the Stop Asian Hate movement; the Stop Immigrant Hate movement; the LGBT movement; the Gender Equality movement. Speak up and be a part of the change. Don\u2019t let what is unacceptable, continue. Don\u2019t be an oppressor and don\u2019t allow yourself to be oppressed.\nWork Cited:\nFlores, M. J., Watson, L.

The better AI is at understanding human emotions and behavior the more suited they could become for human jobs. In Karl Marx\u2019s \u201cEstranged Labour\u201d he talks about different forms of alienation a person can experience in the workplace, one of which is \u201cspecies-being\u201d alienation. If AI does take over the work force it could potentially make this form of alienation more severe.\nIn Karl Marx\u2019s \u201cEstranged Labour\u201d One of the forms of alienation is \u201cspecies-being\u201d which explains that for human beings our life purpose is their work. He explains that creating things is part of the identity of a human being, and that a person is what they create. In modern society this alienation occurs due to divisions of labor, making the worker distanced from the act of creating things. If AI were to take over the workforce this form of alienation would become more severe. Going off of what Karl Marks says about the human identity being what they create, if artificial intelligence takes over jobs then humans will lose their form of identity because they will no longer have the opportunity to create. \nHarari\u2019s book titled 21 Lessons from the 21st Century he explains how the development and improvement of artificial intelligence could lead to AI becoming them main form of worker in the workforce. If this does occur the alienation that occurs because of the distance between a worker and his ability and opportunity to create will deepen. Potentially leading to humans losing their identity. \n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n. \u201c.\u201d  (): . .",

People brought up in a positive well caring home may have a more positive caring conception of self. This is due to what they are taught growing up as well as what they are exposed to regularly in their environment. In Mead\u2019s The Self the I and the Me and Goffman\u2019s the Presentation of Self they explain further into what can influence a person\u2019s conception of self.\nIn Mead\u2019s theory of self, he explains that the self has two sides, the \u201cme\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cme\u201d represents an individual\u2019s learned behaviors and attitudes as well as their expectations of people. The \u201cI\u201d is a person\u2019s response to others. A person who grew up in a healthy environment where morals and a positive perception of themselves and others was taught, will most likely have a more optimistic concept of self. They will expect the best of themselves and others because that is what they have been taught. Goffman explains that people are trying to meet the standards that are put in place for them. In a healthy home those standards are put into place and therefore are strived to achieve. \nMead and Goffman both explain in depth what makes up an individual\u2019s conception of self as well as what can affect it. a person who had a healthy and caring upbringing is more likely to have a more positive conception of self. This is due to morals being taught and how their home life influenced their perception of others. It also is due to a standard being put in place for them to achieve.\n",

        "text": "Sociology \n16 October, 2021\n\nWhite Privilege\nMy brothers are two of six African American students in their entire private high school. I was a pre-professional ballet student for four years away from home, and yet I was one of two African American students my entire time there. What is the reason for this? Is it really that only predominantly white people can afford a private high school? No, it\u2019s much more than that. \nThe systemic issues in our society continue to benefit and support white people automatically, while oppressing people of color, which is known as \u201cwhite privilege\u201d. Many people have denied this term stating that: their life hasn\u2019t been easy, that they\u2019ve had to work hard, or that they are poor. That\u2019s not what it means. White privilege is like an \u201cinvisible package of unearned assets'' (McIntosh, pg. 30) that white people receive just because of their skin color. White privilege is not something that can be taught or learned, it is automatically given to any white individual. It does not matter the age or gender, you still have white privilege. \nSo why do so many people resist to acknowledge it? Well it comes down to fear and refusing to see it. The fact that many people with privilege don\u2019t try to see how they fall into that category, because it simply doesn\u2019t impact them. Then, there are people who know that the system exists but they don\u2019t want to change it because that same system gives them benefits. Instead, white privilege is used by the dominant group as a way to further racialize African Americans. \nWhether it pertains to housing, lending, education, medical disparities, interaction with law enforcement or simply just everyday bias - African Americans disproportionately end up being negatively impacted in all of these categories. As a result, you see more people of color: receiving inadequate education (and therefore often leading to inadequate employment later on), incarcerated, suffering in poverty, labeled as criminals or \u201cthugs\u201d, and more. This provides the exact ammunition for those holding the power to attribute those things to being African American, rather than due to institutionalized racism and white privilege. \nRacism is an ongoing issue that has yet to be resolved but there are not enough people doing anything about it. You can learn about the different cultures instead of judging and making comments about it, and accept and respect people's differences and beliefs.  Schools should teach about it more, people should discuss it with others, get to know someone before making assumptions about them; these are all good places to start. Instead, for example, most schools provide a whitewashed education; rather than teaching students in Wilmington about the 1898 Wilmington massacre, we learn all about what white people did, and how Columbus was a hero. \nWhen people are trying so hard to not be racist they might try to make some jokes or claim that they don\u2019t see color to come across as an inclusive person. However when someone says, \u201cI don\u2019t see color\u201d it is the same thing as saying I don\u2019t see our differences and that's not necessarily good. Everyone doesn\u2019t believe the same things or think the same way, so yes there are differences and it\u2019s how you react to those differences that determines if you are racist or not. There are some people who try to avoid the topic of racism altogether because they believe that if we don\u2019t talk about it then it won\u2019t be an issue any longer, but as a society we are not at that point yet. Instead of avoiding the topic we have to learn how to embrace and accept the differences that make each of us who we are. A big part of this is the school systems fail to educate students properly. School systems need to incorporate a more diverse system for learning considering most people get their education from school, if it is not being learned in school people are most likely to grow up unaware of how important racism is in society and are less likely to learn about it as they get older which is a problem. \nRacism is not something that should be ignored or silenced. There are plenty of people who try to silence the ones fighting for equality, and unfortunately the system and power of white privilege allows that to happen; this is one of the reasons there hasn\u2019t been enough impactful change to systemic racism. Those people who are trying to silence the others are often wearing the privilege of being white, and are often the same people who don\u2019t believe that racism is still a problem. Frequently these are the same people that claim they \u201cdon\u2019t see color.\u201d This is a common theme I have encountered throughout my experience. A majority of those people are also white, and because they are white they have never had to experience the oppression that people of color have to deal with every single day. Instead, they have the benefit of white privilege. White people automatically have one less obstacle to overcome in daily life. It doesn\u2019t mean life is easy and simple for white people, but it does mean that there is not the added layer of skin color to make things more difficult. \nSo how does white privilege really make things easier for white people? As a result of racializing and stereotyping, it is often easier for them to find and keep jobs no matter their previous experience. They do not have the hurdle of being stereotyped at the outset just due to their skin color, and this provides an advantage. Some interviewers won\u2019t even allow a black person to come in for an interview or will offer them a lower position that they could work, even if their resume shows they have a lot of experience and are better for the job (Pager Discrimination article). This is an example of the interviewer being racist because they don\u2019t want to hire someone who is black. Or you can look at what happens in the education system. As a result of racializing, it is more likely that a brown or black skinned student will be overlooked, labeled, or worse. One bad incident early on can start a cycle which makes it harder for these students to receive the same education or experience the same opportunities. \nMy family has to make conscious decisions of where we are going and what the risks may be. Driving through certain geographic areas at night may not be smart, so we try to avoid that. We have learned from a young age what to do when a police officer pulls us over, or interacts with us, to be sure that we don\u2019t do or say anything that could be used against us. None of my friends have had to go through that same \u201ctalk\u201d. This is not something that we should have to teach young children, telling them to be careful how you act around certain people, and having to constantly be in fear of their life.\nI\u2019m a proud black person. I\u2019m a proud white person. Two very similar sentences with very different meanings. Saying that you are a proud black person is saying: I am proud to be me despite society being largely against who I am. It is the idea that you had to fight for equality in this country and that it was never something that you just had. It is empowering. It\u2019s saying I am proud that I have overcome the oppression, racism, hardships, and constant negativity that you receive just for having brown or black skin. It shows that even after being criticized by the beauty standards and by white supremacists, I still love me for me and wouldn\u2019t want to change. However, saying \u201cI am proud to be white\u201d, is not the same. As discussed above, merely by being white, there are automatically certain things that you can do that a black person can\u2019t do. There was nothing that you had to risk your life over or spend decades upon decade trying fighting for something, like equality. From the start everything is automatically easier. With that being said there is a difference between being confident with how you look or your ethnicity and saying you are proud of what your culture has done in the past. \nWhite privilege is an insidious creature, living in us and among us, continuing to foster a destructive system - rather than change it. With education, awareness, willingness to be anti-racist, and advocacy, it is possible to shift this dynamic; we can shift the dynamic so that white peivikege is instead used to make impactful changes to a racist system. This would then ultimately eliminate white privilege. While there is still a percentage of the population who would not want that, we should hope that there is enough power in the percentage of people who do. If awareness of the issue is raised, and changes are made in how people of color are racialized - there is hope to change the longstanding institutionalized racism that this country was built on. \n\nWorks Cited:\nMcIntosh, P.

Technopoly is primarily about putting technology on the face of the world and advocating for it to solve any problem. This idea values making things the same, focusing in, and pursuing for things to go faster than before. With anything there are consequences.  For there has been a notice of a decline in critical thinking, traditional values, and the way people work together. From this, problems can arise that will be addressed later on. Though there are numerous pros and cons, many organizations push for technopoly, hoping it will make society better. On the other side of things, Rationalization is a broader shift pushing for organization and efficiency among everything possible. This means replacing traditional ways with a more rational approach to make things better overall.  Ultimately, Rationalization aims to make society and the world run smoother and more predictable. Though both ideas have similar goals to enhance society, they take a different approach to get things done in their own way. For now, it is important to try to understand their effects on society and how they navigate society today for the brighter future everyone hopes for. \nTechnopoly is about a culture that views technology as the best and ultimate solution to any problem that society is facing. This is because with technology comes valuable characteristics. Standardization, specialization, and efficiency are a few of the key parts and often most favored. These traits are often believed to benefit the shaping of society. However, with this are risks and cons. Just like any action there are consequences, some positive and others negative.  For example, AI has grown in popularity over the years. Although AI has benefited healthcare systems and businesses, and used in education, unfortunately, this causes a decline in critical thinking development and skills. When there is technology that can do the thinking without a person, the person\u2019s mind works less and doesn\u2019t use the opportunity to think without the use of technology. This is where problems start to arise. With technopoly there has been a leading loss of critical thinking, traditional values, and different work ethics. In addition, there is a loss of societal values that can lead to social inequality, loss of privacy, and issues among the workforces. In spite of the risks, institutions, organizations, etc., take the risk and promote technopoly to \u201cbetter\u201d society. Alvin Toffler described how technopoly and the key components of standardization, specialization, and efficiency benefit society. He describes them in three ways being agriculture, industrialization, and information. This is ultimately to better efficiency, convenience, access to information, problem solving, economic growth and overall enchanting quality of society. \nRationalization is a concept from Max Weber as it pertains to the process in which traditional modes of thought, action, problem solving etc, are replaced with more rational, systematic, and efficient ones. Assembly lines come from this idea. Instead of individual craftsmen making individual items, the rational system of an assembly line came where each person specialized in a specific part of making an item. One of the traits rationalization strives for is efficiency. The division of labor divided up among the workers promotes and reaches the goal of increased productivity and efficiency. Keep in mind that rationalization is a broader concept that reaches a multitude of spheres in society, not just assembly lines. This includes economic and culture driving by not only the pursuit of efficiency but, calculability, predictability, and a sense of control. Ultimately this leads to increased productivity and organization. Similar to technology this can lead to a chance. Unlike technopoly the changes are not necessarily about the same 3 traits but more so about how traditional values, beliefs, society structures, are improved by the idea of rational systems. What ultimately makes rationalization different is how the idea is more focused on how rationalization contributes to more and different aspect of society including social organization and culture\nIn the scheme of things understanding how fast society changes is critical with how Technopoly and Rationalization compete to shape modern society. While technopoly promotes technology as the ultimate problem-solver, emphasizing standardization and speed consequence occur. These consequences damage humans in a way as there has been a great decline in critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity. On the other hand, there is rationalization. For that idea seeks organization and efficiency, while also carrying a risk of having a lack of variety and everything being more uniform. Both concepts aim to improve society while they differ in approaches and consequences. Understanding these concepts is crucial in figuring out which way is best to have the upper hand in order to promote a brighter future, where there is a balance of efficiency with ethical considerations for everyone in society. \n\n",

        "text": "Sociology Paper\n\n850576963\n\n\nIn our society, it is evident that certain groups are put into stereotypical categories and are therefore treated differently. One aspect of this that is not discussed as frequently is what occurs when these groups internalize these stereotypes and even continue to perpetuate them. A prime example of this is how women purposely fall into certain roles of femininity in order to pertain to what is considered normal in society. While women have come a long way in terms of obtaining rights and being able attain similar opportunities as men, many still fall into the trap of still trying to pertain to the male gaze. So the question remains, if we are truly equals, then why do women feel the need to portray themselves in a way that is deemed acceptable by society? \nIt is safe to say that times are very different today than they used to be. A little under a century ago, women were fighting just for the right to vote in America and to not be treated as property of men. Nowadays, women are scientists, doctors, filmmakers, and have opportunities to pursue basically any field of interest that they wish. Although things have never been better for women, our society is constantly being inundated with subliminal messages regarding femininity. In stores we see handbags in glittery pink that say \u201cYou go girl!\u201d. On TV there are commercials for barbie dolls with tagline that read, \u201cyou can be whatever you want!\u201d. Everywhere you look, there are false messages about female empowerment, with subtext that essentially tells women that they can do what they want, but they need to remain feminine to do so. Female comedians constantly get glammed up before they go on stage and will most likely face judgement if they don\u2019t, yet when male comedians go up before a crowd of thousands in sweatpants, no one bats an eye. Women are constantly told that they have to play by a certain set of rules if they intend on being as successful as men are. \nI have seen firsthand how women respond to societies messages, and therefore perpetuate them in their own lives. In high school, there were always strict policies involving the dress code, but they almost always only applied to women. Girls were barred from wearing a multitude of different items as to not be too \u201cdistracting\u201d to other students. Yet there seemed to be nothing that pertained to the boys at all. This therefore make women feel uncomfortable int their own skin, and that they are not allowed to wear what they want.  I have also seen examples in college as well. In Greek life culture at colleges, including UNCW, women in sororities are all expected to be extremely feminine and dress up glamorously, especially when attending events or parties. The parties are only allowed to be held by the male sororities and the girls are only expected to do things such as holding fundraisers in cute outfits. The parties are all on the men\u2019s terms and are about them being able to meet girls. Despite how counter to feminism this might seem, girls still continue to join these sororities and do not seem to question many of these outdated traditions. In my own experience, I tried to attend a party with a male friend and was told that only I was allowed in because I was a girl and that they needed to have a certain ratio of women at the party. I have heard even worse stories at other college campuses, where only girls who met certain beauty standards were allowed into parties. One fraternity even went as far as having a secret scale at the door of the house and would not let in girls who weighed above a certain number. Sororities are large communities, and they would be able to change things if they worked together and refused to continue playing by other people\u2019s rules. But the sad truth is that most of them do not and keep adhering to old customs in order to continue to remain popular and relevant.\n\tAnother example of women adhering to toxic femininity was found through Matthew Ezzell\u2019s research of the female rugby players at Competitive University. After observing the rugby team\u2019s habits, he noticed that many of the players engaged in defensive othering as well as other toxic habits. The girls portrayed a strong sense of femininity both on and off the field, to combat possible notions that they were not girly enough, due to the tough nature of the sport. There are many stereotypes surrounding tough female athletes and the rugby girls did everything they could to not fall into them. They would dress glamorously, wear makeup while on the field, and engaged in similar forms of normative identification. They wanted to fit into the feminine narrative, while maintaining a status of being competitive and hardened players. This created a hard scenario for the girls, because not only did they have to prove themselves on the field, but they had to remain feminine and \u201cpretty\u201d while doing it. By doing this, the rugby players were perpetuating the notion that women can only achieve success if they are simultaneously pertaining to the male gaze. This feeds into the subordination that women constantly face and sets a standard for other women to follow suit, or risk being othered. \n\tThe example of the rugby girls helps to paint a clear picture of how women internalize their role in society. While trying to climb the social ladder and become a relevant part of their school, the girls unintentionally undermined feminism as a whole. Not only did the girls feel a strong need to fit certain standards, but they also put down other women and shamed them if they felt they didn\u2019t belong. This is very dangerous. The actions of the majority of a group have a strong influence on its members because it is simply human nature to want to fit in and do what others are doing. This idea of being feminine, dressing up, needing to speak a certain way, are all things that have fallen into the collective consciousness of women in general. \n\tAll in all, this perdiciment that women in our society are currently in is very complicated to say the least. While there is a great deal of empowerment going on, there is also a struggle for women to stay in certain positions unless they act a certain way. Over a long period of time, women have had to fight every step of the way to achieve the same things as men. Even after that, women feel the need to control themselves so they fit into a category that is palatable and accepted. It is hard to say how this issue could eventually be resolved, but it seems that one of the main things that has to happen is that women need to work together more to fight this silent sexism. I feel that only after this, will women be able to take down these stereotypes that have followed us over centuries, and be able to rise above them. If more people take steps to show others that they don\u2019t have to fit into a box in order to be successful, others will most likely follow in suit, and will no longer have to be under the pressure of constantly conforming to society\u2019s expectations.

        "text": "Sociology\nNovember 29, 2021\nRacism and Religion \u2013 How it all Fits. Or does it?\n\nHarari has many adamant and powerful positions which discusses in his book: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.  With his impassioned arguments, he shares similar views with other authors, economists, and philosophers, as well as shares quite contrary views with some people. This essay will highlight just a few of those similarities or differences, between Harari and other writers and thinkers.\nOne example of this is on the subject of racism, specifically, how it has evolved and changed over time \u2013 to modern day. Michael Omi and Howard Winant, in the  excerpt \u201cRacial Formations\u201d, from the book Racial Formations in the United States: From the 1960s to the 1980s, assert that as race is a social construct, it was developed and evolved from just having differences in people\u2019s skin color. In fact, the authors in this article argue that the use of racism in this new, modernized, evolved way, is very much deliberate and a way to oppress groups of people. The way this is done is by attributing specific negative characteristics or behaviors, to certain groups of people \u2013 based on skin color, or country of origin, for example. As Omi and Wyant write: \u201cSkin color \u2018differences\u2019 are thought to explain perceived differences in intellectual, physical, and artistic temperaments, and to justify distinct treatment of racially identified individuals and groups\u201d (Omi & Winant, page 23). Race became a way to explain societal issues and failures, blaming issues on negative and racist stereotypes of African Americans. The authors here argue that this shift in \u2018racializing\u2019 groups of people is a more modern day development. This attributing of negative traits to people of color is something that the authors assert has further perpetuated a system which is full of systemic racism, which is also then absorbed by our society. People then tend to accept and believe what they are hearing and seeing on various forms of media, as to how some groups of people may act. This is a way for human beings to explain problems, to disassociate themselves from \u2018bad people\u2019 or \u2018bad things\u2019 and to further oppress groups of people.\nSimilarly, Harari believes that racism is alive and unfortunately, well; however, he argues that the way it presents has evolved from being based upon biological differences, to focusing on an individual\u2019s culture. Even with this evolution, racism is still very much about judging an individual or group of people based on assumptions, stereotypes, and bias.  This is similar to Omi and Winant\u2019s beliefs.\nIn his book, Harari dives into the issues and beliefs surrounding immigration. Immigration of a \u201cforeign\u201d person who does not come from there, into a new country. Using the context of immigration, Harari points out how racism has evolved into something different today.  This evolution of racism began with the time period where it was both publicly, and widely accepted, that white people were the superior race. Of course through history and all of the events that took place, Harari points out, there was a shift in this \u201cRacism was seen not only as morally abysmal but also as scientifically bankrupt\u201d ( Harari, p 149). However, in its place came a new type of racism, or a new demonstration of it.  While the morality factor, as well as scientific evidence, discourages people from stating that a person of color is inferior because they are \u2018biologically\u2019 different, there is now the belief that based on where a person is from (location-wise, or national origin), there are negative stereotypes and assumptions that can be attributed to that group of people. This is racism, just in a different disguise, according to Harari. As he writes: \u201cSaying that black people tend to commit crimes because they have substandard genes is out; saying that they tend to commit crimes because they come from dysfunctional subcultures is very much in\u201d (Harari, page 152). \nHarari\u2019s stance on this evolved form of racism is very much aligned with Omi and Winant\u2019s position. Harari does take it a step further than Omi and Winant, where he points out that this \u2018new\u2019 form of racism may look on the surface like it is less racist than the former. However, as Harari discusses, in the context of immigration \u2013 if the pressure is to get the immigrants to become more like \u2018us\u2019, then it really is no better: \u201c\u2026present day culturists might be more tolerant than traditional racists \u2013 if only the \u2018others\u2019 adopt our culture, we will accept them as our equals. On the other hand, that could result in far stronger pressures on the \u2018others\u2019 to assimilate, and in far harsher criticism of their failure to do so\u201d (Harari, page 153). This perfectly illustrates the issue with viewing this new racism as a better or more tolerant form. It still remains the same: judging individuals based on assumptions and stereotypes, and using negative attributes to label an entire group of people \u2013 merely based on where they are from, what their ethnic background is.\nOn another topic, religion, Harari differs in his view from Max Weber. While the issue of religion and its involvement in our policy making or social interactions is separate and different from religion, there is of course some overlap.\nMax Weber, in his article titled \u201cThe Spirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage\u201d, writes that religion is something that not only \u2018can\u2019 create social change, but that it has historically been used, and can still be used, and should be used. In fact, Weber argues that the Puritan people were \u201ccalled\u201d (Weber, p 105) to their particular work, whereas today, people are instead \u201cforced.\u201d  Weber further argues that the religious calling, spirit and reasoning behind one\u2019s work, historically, is what made it something meaningful, significant, and powerful. In contrast, today\u2019s modern day Capitalism, Weber argues, is devoid of that religious foundation. Without it, Weber asserts that this creates a lack of values, no sort of satisfaction from work, and really a lack of anything good. In this way, Weber asserts that this has led humans to simply be motivated by the making of money, rather than working for some higher purpose, to benefit society or other human beings. Interestingly, Weber believes that religion is actually where capitalism first originated from. However, modern day capitalism, in his view, has strayed from where it began. Rather than being \u201ccalled\u201d to a particular work, and doing so as a result \u2013 currently, we are now just doing the work, to make the money. This, Weber believes, moves away from the religious foundation, which is to our detriment as a society.\n\tHarari\u2019s position on the interplay of Religion and policy making and politics is vastly different from Weber\u2019s. Contrary to Weber\u2019s stance, Harari asserts the belief that there really is no appropriate place for religion in the making of policy, or social change, in our society.  Harari argues that the involvement of religion is dangerous, in large part due to the fact that there are so many different religions. Whose is right? Whose is better, or best? Every religion thinks their religion is the \u201cright\u201d one. So, Harari argues, how does that possibly fit into policy making and politics. While his views do not necessarily directly contradict with Weber\u2019s belief that religion can motivate a person to operate in a spiritually-led way, his views differ overall -in that he believes religion does not have an appropriate place in the political and  policy relations in our society and world. As Harari highlights about human nature and thinking: \u201cNational, religious and cultural tensions are made worse by the grandiose feeling that my nation, my religion, and my culture are the most important in the world -and therefore my interests should come before the interests of anyone else, or of humankind as a whole\u201d (Harari, page 183). This sums up his concern pretty perfectly, pointing out that while each religion believes itself to be the best, the most correct, then this would lead to disagreement in actions, policy, and beliefs \u2013 due to the simple fact that there are multiple different religions. \n\tWithin his argument, Harari focuses a lot on the concept of humility. This concept is something he says is lacking in the use of religion within politics and policy making in our world.  There is no humility when each religion believes their own to be true, to be the best, to be superior to others, and the \u201cright\u201d one.  This perfectly illustrates the issue involving religion on the biggest stage \u2013 world human relations and policy making. In contrast, Weber is arguing that Christianity in particular, has been, and should be, the moral compass to determine how to motivate individuals and groups, and within the making of policies and effecting social changes. \n\tAs you can see, even where Harari may align his views with other notable thinkers and writers, there is considerable difference between him and others. Harari\u2019s book helps to set forth his positions in totality, and presents the arguments with sufficient substance and reasoning. The two topics of religion and racism are two topics which have received considerable attention, thinking and writing from various individuals over time \u2013 and this continues to be the case today. As a result, we can see that Harari has some similar views \u2013 for example \u2013 with Omi and Winant; whereas, he differs significantly in views on religion (in some aspects at least) from those views of Max Weber. Religion and race/racism are topics which are complex and extremely laden with human emotions, and deep conviction. ",

        "text": "SOC 105\n4/27/22\n\nSelf-Conception\nThe statement \u201cbe yourself\u201d is quite a puzzling remark for someone to hear. How can we act as someone we are not? How can we be anyone other than ourselves? It is well understood that we change how we act around others. For example, we may not be the same person around our family as we are our friends, or even when we are alone by ourselves. Despite the fact we may feel there is only our one-self that we are constantly being, the self actually has many different parts to it, and we do dictate how we feel about ourselves based on how we feel others perceive us.\nNaturally, when we are talking to a professor, having an interview, or even checking out at the grocery store we will not be our true selves. Depending on the situation, it is common to lose your natural personality, or even gain a whole new one.\nPersonally, I have been told \u201cYou\u2019re not acting like yourself\u201d or \u201cWhy are you acting so different?\u201d A few times I have been told the second statement and I honestly did not know what that meant. How am I acting different than myself? However, in other situations I can catch myself acting completely different; and I know why. I am a cashier at a local grocery store, I generally work 3 days a week and I encounter many different people throughout a 6-hour shift, I am faced with many different personalities every time I check customers out. Like most workers whose job revolves around people, I have a customer service voice. I talk with a higher pitch, clearer and overall kinder than I normally do. The second I am done working with a customer, my customer service voice switches right off and I begin to talk to my coworkers in my normal voice. In addition to my customer service voice, I have realized that depending on the customer, I will almost completely change my personality to match theirs, it is essentially a way for me to match their \u201cvibe\u201d and be able to click with them while I am ringing up their groceries.\nI have known that I act differently at work than anybody I am close with has ever seen me. My boyfriend, who aside from my best friend, sees me in arguably my realest version of myself. He came through my checkout line one day at work without my knowledge. I was speaking with a customer and checking out her items while he was next in line for checkout overhearing my whole conversation. When he came up to me my voice and personality switched over to normal and he was taken by surprise. I remember him saying \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that side of you\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s weird to see you act so different.\u201d I bet it was weird for him to see me act that way, I am sure it would be peculiar for anyone close to me to see me act that way. It is ironic to me that someone like my boyfriend who has most likely seen every side of me has not seen the side of me that I share with different strangers at work every week.\nAside from wanting to connect with the customers I am faced with at work, I want to be liked by them; I want to get a positive review from my manager. The feeling of being liked or being complimented is naturally a good feeling. When I have a good interaction with a customer and I get the feeling they like me or enjoy talking to me, I feel good about myself. In everyday interactions not even just at work, with strangers on campus, professors, and friends it is a confidence boost. If I feel like someone views me in a negative way, I will think negatively of myself. It causes a feeling like I have done something wrong.\nWilliam James, the Father of American Psychology explains the topic of the self as having many different parts to it. His theory involves 4 constituents of the self, which can be divided into 3 separate parts. The three parts include: Its constituents (Material self, social self, the spiritual self, and the pure ego), the feelings and emotions they arouse (self- feelings) and the actions to which they prompt (self-seeking and self-preservation). The purpose of this division of the self is to fully understand it. James states \u201cA man has many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind.\u201d The social self is the recognition someone gets from their peers. The social self fluctuates, and with the 4 components of the self, James recognizes the self can be different depending on the context that it is in. To William James, it is not sufficient just for one to be aware of oneself because, he argues, to be fully human we require others to recognize us and show us that they know we exist. \nThe theory of letting how we feel others perceive us dictating how we feel about ourselves comes from James Horton Cooley. He refers to this theory as the looking glass self. \"Each to each a looking glass, reflects the other that doth passed.\u201d This is the idea that our view of ourselves not only comes from how we see ourselves in our own minds, but also how we are perceived in other people's minds; all affecting our self-image. \u201cThe thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind.\u201d This also depends on the mind's perception of social context.\nThe understanding I have as to why I have been told \u201cyou\u2019re not acting like yourself\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re acting differently\u201d comes from William James\u2019s theory of the self. I act differently at work with customers and managers due to the different context that I am in. The part of James\u2019s theory that really resonates with this action is the social self. This is a concept of myself that is reflected in my social interactions with others, and in my case at work. I want to be regarded and recognized by these customers as a good employee, someone they do not mind talking to. I do not necessarily think that they would not like the \u201creal\u201d me or my spiritual self as James would call it, it is more me just trying to fit with the situation and be more similar to the customer and match myself with their own selves. The form of self that William James says is capable of performing different roles in changing situations is the social self, and that is what I do while working with people I do not know, I play different roles. \nI want the customers to me like me as well, as I mentioned that makes me feel good about myself. The reason for doing so is James Horton Cooley's theory of the looking glass self. I want to be a good employee to these customers not only because I want them to feel good about my service, but so that I can feel good about myself. It is a better feeling to know they have a good reflection of them in their mind, as well as my manager will too. Their judgements greatly affect my own view of myself.\nAs humans, we all value others' opinions. There is an urge to want to be liked and the people around us to have positive images and reflections about our own selves. It is also common to change the way we act around certain groups of people. Our selves are almost like machines, with many different components all working together. Every social interaction effects our self, and the various parts involved in it. To fully understand and answer the question \u2018be yourself\u201d William James and James Cooley\u2019s theories would have to be considered. Ultimately, we could respond with \u201cwhich one?\u201d  ",

        "text": "We can see this idea that men think they know best in \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper,\u201d where Gilman writes about this woman who is sick. Her husband has diagnosed her with nervous depression. He often dismisses her wants to work and write because he believes she needs to rest and not do anything. She has to hide her journal from him, which she becomes very good at, and because she is used to this, she is often defending her husband in the story. He is careful, loving, and gives her special direction. The woman learns to hide her writing, becomes so fixated and obsessed on this wallpaper, which her husband does not notice, and drives herself into insanity. \nWomen back then were often dismissed, and their worries were not important. Now equality is still in issue. While we have come a long way from just being housewives and being unable to attend school, there are obstacles that need to be overcome. Women are not only what men decide they can be, one is not superior to the other (although arguments can be made), they differentiate greatly, and women have done many great things to overcome the societal norms of a woman and their roles in life. Girls can go to school and have jobs. Equal pay is still an issue that needs to be overcome and hopefully will be one overcome soon.",
