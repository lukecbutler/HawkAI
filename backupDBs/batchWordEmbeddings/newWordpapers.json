Sandel, in his book titled \u201cJustice.\u201d To better address the broad topic of justice, Sandel identifies three approaches to the concept: welfare, freedom, and virtue. He concedes at the end of his book that he ultimately favors the approach of virtue and the common good. Ultimately, Sandel advocates for a theory that aligns with communitarian ideals, challenging the notions of the philosophers he writes about. As he approaches his conclusion, Sandel takes his readers on a journey through the theories of Bentham, Kant, and Rawls to question which theory addresses fairness and justice most effectively. \nSandel refers to the teachings of Jeremy Bentham as he discusses and critiques the theory of utilitarianism. Concerning his theory and justice, Bentham argues that \u201cthe right thing to do is whatever will maximize utility\u201d (Sandel 34). Simply put, people are obligated to make decisions that maximize happiness and minimize pain. The straightforward nature of the theory gave rise to objections, which later utilitarian philosophers like J.S. Mills would attempt to remedy. However, Sandel still finds conflict with the fundamental theories that underlie utilitarian thought. \nSandel\u2019s first critique argues that utilitarianism diminishes individual rights by weighing the heightened pleasure of a majority over the pain of a few. He cites the example the city of happiness, in which one child is condemned to a life of suffering so that the rest of the city can flourish. Sandel says that although the majority benefit, it is still wrong to violate the child\u2019s rights. Sandel\u2019s second critique focuses on the issue of utilitarian calculus and the uniform value measurement the theory requires. To calculate the offset between pleasure and pain, a value may be attached to human life. In times when anti-smoking movements or even car brands have attempted to define the value of a human life to conduct utilitarian calculus, the public has lashed back. The sentiment of the public is shared with Sandel\u2014attempting to attach value to something as abstract of human life ultimately diminishes it. \nSandel\u2019s alignment with communitarian thought strongly contrasts utilitarian philosophy. A communitarian perspective would argue that as utilitarianism weighs the value of each person equally, communal ties people may share with family members or fellow citizens are disregarded. Take for example the famous trolley problem. If one track contained two strangers and the other contained someone\u2019s child, the utilitarian would argue that saving the two strangers would likely override any loyalty to family, as the net happiness of saving two strangers outweighs saving one. Examining this problem through a utilitarian perspective devalues the relationships people have between each other. Sandel also highlights how communitarian thought clashes with the basic utilitarian tenet of maximizing happiness through his discussion of patriotism. Not only are familial ties at odds with utilitarian thought, so too are ties between citizens and their country. For example, a utilitarian could also find issues in the \u201cBuy American\u201d movement. In response to decreasing industrial prowess in America, congress passed a stimulus bill that was aimed at reinvigorating American industry. Through a utilitarian lens, one could argue that happiness and pleasure could have been maximized by injecting that money into a struggling, developing nation that needed it more than a still relatively robust American job market. However, communitarian principles would include the influence of people\u2019s obligation to the communities they are a part of, and the bonds shared between countrymen. \nSandel further explores his theory as he examines the theories of Emmanuel Kant and John Rawls. Both philosophers advocate for a neutral view of justice but arrive at that conclusion through different methods. Kant\u2019s theory breaks away from the utilitarian principle of maximizing pleasure through its introduction of two categorical imperatives, the first of which refers to adhering to universally applicable principles, and the second arguing that people must always be treated as ends in themselves. The two categorical imperatives define Kant\u2019s moral law through its emphasis on autonomy. Freedom and autonomy are derived from acting on reason, separating oneself from desires and instead acting according to universally willed maxims. Treating people as ends, rather than means, leads to ultimately respecting everyone as a rational being that has the capacity for self-direction. This view abstracts individuals from a society that offers competing visions of the good life, allowing people to define their own moral code. \nRawl\u2019s theory also reaches a neutral view of justice through the concept of \u201cthe veil of ignorance.\u201d To develop a fair and equal society, the principles that govern said society should be made behind this veil, which strips individuals of knowledge about their social position, class, natural talents, gender, religion, and other factors that could result in biased thought. Rawls\u2019s idea of autonomy derives from the idea that individuals choose principles of justice through rational deliberation, rather than making decisions under the influence of interests or attachments. A lack of preconception of what the good life is results in a neutral conception of justice in Rawls\u2019s theory. \nSandel\u2019s alignment with communitarian thought leads him to conflict with Kant and Rawlsian theory. The first conflict arises as Sandel introduces the obligation of solidarity. Kant\u2019s belief in the abstraction of self and Rawls\u2019s concept of the veil of ignorance are essential in their respective theories to maintain their neutral attitude towards justice. However, these beliefs discredit the important influence of people\u2019s communities and traditions. Kant and Rawls ignore this influence through their belief that obligations are either natural, derived from the social contract, or are voluntary, based on explicit consent. \nSandel\u2019s reference to the obligation of solidarity highlights the importance of the bonds formed through family ties, shared history, or citizenship. Sandel references two examples in his discussion of familial obligation. The first follows a parent choosing to save their child first out of two drowning kids in a river. The second example reverses the roles, referencing a child choosing to care for their sick mother first over caring for someone else\u2019s sick mother. In either of these cases, Kant and Rawls would attempt to derive the obligation to one\u2019s family by tracing it back to consent or some universally recognized duty. However, Sandel argues that these obligations are derived from the shared history and relationships between family members. \nAttempting to separate familial, or communal ties, from the notion of obligation showcases Kant and Rawls\u2019s continued fealty to their broader views on neutrality. Kant\u2019s abstraction of the self and Rawls\u2019s insistence on the separation of aims, attachments, and conceptions of the good are evidence of their attempts to safeguard autonomy by keeping justice impartial. Sandel, however, drawing on Aristotle, argues that conversations about justice cannot be neutral. The development of a just constitution not only distributes rights but is necessary to \u201cform good citizens and to cultivate good character\u201d (Sandel 242). Aristotle\u2019s theory directly conflicts with Kant and Rawls\u2019s championship of individual freedom by attempting to cultivate and instill certain values. The two philosophers address moral influence on government by advocating for a neutral moral framework. Rawls even concedes that people may be burdened by their own loyalties but argues that these attachments should have no influence on one\u2019s identity as a citizen and be removed from debates about justice and rights. \nIn contrast, Sandel argues that justice demands the influence of personal attachments and morality. In fact, he even goes so far as to say that neutrality in government is impossible. He mentions debates over abortion. In a pro-choice versus pro-life debate, it's easy to fall into the trap of believing that government neutrality would agree with a pro-choice argument. However, as Sandel points out, even choosing to remain \u201cneutral\u201d makes a moral claim, which would be that the contesting belief that life begins at conception is wrong. Similarly, in discussing the legality of gay marriage, Sandel points out that government cannot remain neutral about the definition of marriage. Either marriage is defined as a moral good, open to all relationships, or it is restricted based on contesting moral definitions. As the only true way to ensure freedom in the case of marriage would be to outsource the burden to private associations, it is impossible for the state to remain morally neutral. Through these two concepts, Sandel illustrates how pluralist societies inevitably face moral conflicts that must require moral judgement. While Kant and Rawls defend neutrality to protect the right of individuals to pursue their own good, Sandel insists that community ties and moral purposes are inescapable in political life. As he closes out his novel, Sandel says that \u201ca politics of moral engagement is not only a more inspiring ideal than a politics of avoidance. It is also a more promising basis for a just society\u201d (Sandel 269). Justice cannot remain neutral but rather must involve a collective process of reasoning about the good, a necessity that communitarianism addresses. \nSandel\u2019s novel \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d navigates several compelling theories that attempt to answer that very question. However, Sandel provides a potent critique of the philosophy he references, namely Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism, and Kant and Rawls\u2019s individualism. He concludes that communitarianism and the obligation of solidarity answer questions that former theorists cannot and ultimately lay the foundation for the development of a more just and united society. \n\n\nWork Cited \nSandel, Michael J. \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2009.

        "text": "Sociology of Family\nDr. Engleman \n22 October 2025\nThe Future of Family\nSince the beginning of the 1950s, and especially in the 1970s-80s, the United States has seen drastic changes in the structuring and defining of an \u201caverage\u201d American family. This can be attributed to many factors, including the rise of women in the workforce, the culture wars in the 1970s/80s, legalization of interracial and same-sex families, etc. During the culture wars, the country was split between traditional family ideologies and progressive, modern family ideologies, which respected the idea that there are multiple types of families (Coontz, 2015). Since that point, the United States has seen an increase in divorce rates, cohabitation, age of first marriage, single parenting, etc., and on the other hand has seen a decline in marriage rates and fertility rates. Gender roles in the family have become more equitable with the entrance of women in the workforce, the feminist movement, and the increase of dual-income households but in general, women today still take on the majority of the childcare and housework (Percheski, 2013). The \u201ctraditional\u201d nuclear family model has become increasingly less popular over the years, until recently with the resurgence and growing popularity of conservative political ideologies. Despite all of these changes and developments, however, marriage still remains a future aspiration for most people. Based on research conducted related to family patterns in the past and most recent years, this analysis is going to predict the future of family models and patterns in 2035, highlighting differences related to race, ethnicity, and education.\nWhile marriage rates have continued to decrease since the 1970s, most Americans still consider marriage to be a goal for their future. There are people choose to not get married for a number of reasons, but many Americans don\u2019t get married or get married much later on in life simply because it is unobtainable financially. Marriage is extremely expensive, time consuming, and a huge commitment, and for these reasons people \u201c...tie marriage \u2018readiness\u2019 to having a comfortable income, little to no debt, and a secure job\u201d (Smock, P. & Schwartz, C., 2020). People want to be able to enjoy their wedding, have the celebration that \u201cthey\u2019ve always dreamed of,\u201d and still be living comfortably after it\u2019s all said and done. Statistics taken from the U.S. Census Bureau in 1967 vs. 2018 showed that \u201cIn 1967, 70% of adults were living with a spouse compared with only 51% in 2018, and declines over the past decade matched those in the 1990s and 2000s\u201d (Smock, P. & Schwartz, C., 2020). Other research has shown that this has only continued to decrease, as only \u201c47% of households were headed by married couples\u201d in 2024 (usafacts, 2025). With the current economic state of our country and struggles that so many middle-to-lower class citizens are facing right now, it can safely be assumed that these trends will only continue downwards, and the United States will most likely see 45% of married households or less.\nFor those who are still getting married in the United States today, their households may look quite different from the traditional family model. First, couples are getting married much later on in life, for reasons such as finances and more people, especially women compared to the past, wanting to focus on independence and building their career before concerning themselves with marriage. Research shows that in the 70s, women were on average getting married around 21 years old and men around 23 years old, however, by 2018 \u201cwomen were on getting married around the age of 28 and men around the age of 30\u201d (Smock, P. & Schwartz, C., 2020). Other studies have shown that this has stayed somewhat stagnant over the past few years, with the median age of marriage for men being 30.5 and 28.6 for women in 2022 (Bieber, C. J. D., 2024). Another drastic and notable change from the traditional family model is that there are many married households without children at all and there has been an overall decrease in fertility in the United States. Pew Research Center found that \u201cIn 1970, 67% of Americans ages 25 to 49 were living with their spouse and one or more children younger than 18. Over the past five decades, that share has dropped to 37%\u201d (Aragao, C., Parker, K. & et al., 2023), which showcases the simultaneous increase in age of first marriage and decrease in rates of parenthood. Overall, the United States population has continued to get married later in life and having children is no longer a \u201crequirement\u201d to have a family. Due to the age of first marriage staying stagnant over the past few years, it can be assumed that there won\u2019t be much change in that over the next 10 years. While it is likely that less household families in the future will continue to have children, it is not likely that the fertility rates will continue downwards, considering the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the criminalization of abortions in many states. It is more likely than anything that the United States will see an increase in childbirths out of wedlock over the next 10 years, considering that has already been on the rise (Aragao, C., Parker, K. & et al., 2023).\nThe national legalization of same-sex marriage from the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 completely changed the way our society viewed families and \u201cwhat constituted a family.\u201d Same-gender family dynamics challenge traditional gender norms and ideals, and many studies have been conducted relating to the structure of same-gender families and how gender roles apply differently and similarly to different-gender couples. The National Institute of Health found that \u201cfrom 2016 to 2017, the number of married same-gender couples increased from 486,994 to 547,000\u201d (Smock, P. & Schwartz, C., 2020). The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law also found that \u201cas of June 2025, there are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S.\u201d (UCLA, 2025). The number of same-gender married couples has only continued to increase over the years, but it is important to note that same-gender couples are facing many of the same economic challenges that different-gender couples are dealing with. Due to this, there may be a stagnation in the rate of same-gendered married couples over the next 10 years as well.\nMothers entering the workforce post WWII was the catalyst for changes in family ideals and household structures. However, things are still not nearly as \u201cegalitarian\u201d as they should be. There are many marriages today that have a woman as the primary breadwinner and many others where both partners make the same amount of money in a dual-income household. Over the past 50 years, \u201cthe share of women who earn as much as or significantly more than their husband has roughly tripled\u201d (Fry, R., Hurst, K, et al., 2023). Even with this increase in financial equality within the household women still carry a much heavier load when it comes to household work, such as cooking and cleaning, and childcare, and men spend much more time on leisure and work, even when their wife is the primary breadwinner of the household. These gender norms are still very prevalent in households across the country; however, interviews and studies have shown that most Americans actually believe that both parents should be equally focused on work and home/childcare. While mothers are still taking on most of the childcare and housework, there are many households today where fathers are the primary caretakers of their children and/or a stay-at-home father. In the next 10 years in 2035, there will still be many households with mothers who are the primary caretakers of their children; however, it is also likely that we will continue to see an increase in the number of stay-at-home fathers as the primary caretakers.\nDivorce and cohabitation rates have been heavily on the rise right along with the strong decline in marriage and fertility rates. With women entering the workforce, many of them found their independence and made the decision to leave their marriages, most of them likely being abusive in some way. Today, the divorce rates are \u201c43% of first marriages end in divorce, 60% of second marriages, and 73% of third marriages\u201d (Bieber, C. J. D., 2024). There are many reasons why people choose to get divorced, such as lack of commitment from their partner, domestic abuse, and infidelity. While these factors are going to continue into years to come, it is likely that there won\u2019t be a huge decrease in the divorce rates in 2035 simply due to financial constraints. Divorce costs couples \u201con average $7,000 to dissolve their union\u201d (Bieber, C. J. D., 2024), which may lead to many couples choosing to postpone their divorce or push to fix their marriage. Cohabitation rates have also seen a huge increase over the past decades, and living together is no longer seen solely as a steppingstone to marriage. As of 2014, over 70% of people getting married had lived with their spouses beforehand\u201d (Smock, P. & Schwartz, C., 2023). These rates will most likely continue to increase, especially for those who are economically challenged, as many people live together in order to afford rent and other necessities. \nBy 2035, the United States is expected to see continued developments and changes to the various family models that we have today. Using data from the past and current data, this analysis attempted to predict the \u201cfuture of family\u201d in the United States, covering multiple different atmospheres. These atmospheres included women\u2019s involvement in the workforce, age of marriage, fertility, divorce and cohabitation rates, and the development of same-gender families. While many of these predictions are based on this data, it is important to recognize the impact of the current political climate and of the impacts of the media and outside forces. Things like this that are less predictable and constantly developing could lead to strong falters in these predictions. Our society is constantly growing, changing and learning new things, forever encouraging changes within social institutions and societal structures, family always being the most important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\nAragao, C., Parker, K. & et al.

        "text": "SOC-250-001\n19 September 2025 \nWhat is Justice? \nThe author of \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d is an American political philosopher and professor at Harvard University named Michael Joseph Sandel. This book is a New York Times bestseller that explores political philosophy and moral dilemmas by applying theoretical and analytical thinking to real-world issues. Sandel invites the readers to engage in reasoned debate about justice and the common good in society. He challenges the shallowness of debates focused solely on personal gain or individual liberty, arguing for a third basis: the impact on the common good. In \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d, it focuses on and examines different philosophical approaches to justice, including those of Aristotle, Kant, Mill, and Rawls, to understand contrasting ideas. While engaging with complex philosophy, the book is written in a lively and accessible way, making it suitable for a broad audience interested in making sense of politics, morality, and their own beliefs. \nChapter 1, \u201cDoing the Right Thing,\u201d of \u201cJustice: What is the right thing to do?\u201d talks about the central question of justice: how should we decide what\u2019s right? He uses real-world problems and dilemmas to depict this, for example, his trolley problem, Hurricane Charley, or the Afghan goatherds. He uses these examples to show three main approaches to justice: maximizing welfare (utilitarianism), respecting freedom (libertarianism), and promoting virtue/common good (Aristotelian traditions). The runaway trolley dilemma proposes the question of saving one life or saving five when the solution is in hand. The brakes on the trolley stop working, and there are two groups on the track. You can pull the lever and move the trolley to the right, killing one worker and sparing five. A little bit later into the story it proposes another question: if you are just watching from a distance and see a bigger man standing there, you could push him onto the tracks and avert this disaster. In my opinion, I would not push this man onto the tracks, knowing in doing this I just killed him and put myself into a bigger situation. I would just let the train go, knowing I could not do anything aligning with my morals. It would be on my guilty conscience that I just killed this man when I could have removed myself from the situation and not done anything. Obviously this is a hard and terrible situation, knowing you could have people but at the loss of others. \nIn chapter 2, \u201cThe Greatest Happiness Principle/Utilitarianism,\u201d it speaks about utilitarianism, defining justice as maximizing overall happiness or pleasure. Sandel explores strengths like simplicity and impartiality and weaknesses like knowing utilitarianism can justify sacrificing individuals, ignores rights, and undervalues higher ideals. Like, for example, the lifeboat story when there were four stranded sailors, and when the cabin boy got sick, the group killed and ate him. They claimed they did this out of necessity to survive and promote the general well-being of keeping the majority alive. Bentham, an English moral philosopher, founded the doctrine of utilitarianism to maximize happiness. Mill contradicts this idea, thinking refinement emphasizes quality of pleasures and liberty as essential to well-being. Chapter 3, \u201cDo We Own Ourselves?/Libertarianism,\u201d goes hand in hand with this. Libertarianism holds that individuals own themselves and their labor, so government oversight should be minimal\u2014protecting life, property, and contracts. Sandel examines issues in the book like taxation as it is seen as forced labor, drug laws, and military conscription. For libertarianism, taxation is seen as forced labor because \u201cif you are taxed, you can always choose to work less and pay lower taxes; but if you are forced to labor, you have no such choice.\u201d Basically saying that people are forced to pay the government money, and it should be voluntary; if they wanted to pay and help the community, they would. The tension arises between absolute self-ownership and the social responsibilities that come with living in a community. Personally, it's hard for me to lean one way completely because in certain situations I could agree with either. I do think that taxes should be something everyone has to pay and should not be voluntary because it helps the majority, but I also don\u2019t think some people should be sacrificed unwillingly to help the majority.\nChapter 4, \u201cHired Help / Markets and Morals,\u201d asks whether everything should be up for sale. Sandel considers markets in controversial areas like military service substitutes, surrogate motherhood, and organ sales. He argues markets aren\u2019t neutral: they can corrupt or degrade the value of certain goods and can create inequality by allowing the wealthy to \u201cbuy\u201d advantages. One story that gets brought up to demonstrate this is \u201cPregnancy for Pay,\u201d which is about a family paying a surrogate to have their baby since they can\u2019t. It comes up with the question of if they are paying for the baby itself, which is baby-selling, or paying for the service of having the baby. Mary-Beth is the surrogate for the Sterns, and eventually when she has the baby for them, she tries to take it, but they go to court and fight for custody of the child. The baby ultimately went to the Stern family for the child's sake. In my opinion, I think they were paying Mary Beth for the service of having the child and the burden of carrying it to term for them, not for the baby itself. Also, I think it is a good idea that the child ended up in the custody of the Sterns because they had a contract set and paid Mary Beth; not only that, but she tried to flee with the child. \n\u201cWhat Matters Is the Motive/Immanuel Kant\u201d is the name of chapter 5, and it focuses on how Kant shifts focus from consequences to motives. Thinking that the only truly moral actions are those done from duty, guided by reason, and acting only on principles you would have as universal laws, treat people as ends, not means. Justice, in Kant\u2019s eyes, requires respecting human dignity, not maximizing welfare or efficiency. He believes that actions represented as good in themselves are necessary: \u201cKant contrasts hypothetical imperatives, which are always conditional, with a kind of imperative that is unconditional: a categorical imperative\u201d (pg. 112). I don't fully believe in Kant's ideas; for example, if an axe murderer was coming after my friend, I would lie about where they were. I would want my friend to survive, and I would not want to be the reason they got found and killed. There are reasons to lie sometimes, which Kant doesn\u2019t believe. In Chapter 6, \u201cThe Case for Equality / John Rawls,\u201d Rawls argues that justice is fairness. Using the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d thought experiment, he claims people would choose two principles: equal basic liberties for all, and inequalities are just only if they benefit the least advantaged, involving social and economic equality. Kant and Rawls agree on the importance of universal principles, autonomy, and justice over consequences. Rawls ideas challenge libertarianism and utilitarianism by emphasizing fairness over luck or efficiency.\nIn Chapter 7, \u201cArguing Affirmative Action,\u201d Sandel examines debates over affirmative action in college admissions. He outlines three justifications: correcting past injustice, promoting diversity, and promoting meritocracy. Critics argue it violates fairness or demeans achievement. For example, the Hopwood study is based on Cheryl Hopwood, a white applicant who was denied admission to the University of Texas Law School despite strong academic credentials. She argued that the school\u2019s affirmative action policy discriminated against her, since minority applicants with lower grades and test scores were admitted. In my opinion, I think there are many different things that go into college applications that could be bigger than test scores and academics. Like their essay, extracurriculars, athletics, etc. Even if they were even on that standpoint and just differed in academics, I think the school is still entitled to choose who they want if they want to include more diversity. She did not have to go to this college, and college is a choice and privilege for many people. The discussion highlights deeper questions: what counts as merit, and should admissions reflect individual achievement or social purposes?\nIn chapter 8, \u201cWho Deserves What?/Aristotle,\u201d it kind of goes along with chapter 7, saying that Aristotle sees justice as giving people what they deserve, but this depends on the purpose or telos of the good being distributed. For example, the purpose of a university is cultivating knowledge, not rewarding legacy or wealth. Justice thus requires reasoning about virtue and the common good, not just neutral principles. In the book, they talk about the story of Callie Smartt, a high school freshman with cerebral palsy. She was a cheerleader during the football season, but at the end she got kicked off for not being able to perform the gymnastics and tumbling required to be on the team. \u201cCallie\u2019s story raises two questions. One is a question of fairness. Should she be required to do gymnastics in order to qualify as a cheerleader, or is this requirement unfair, given her disability?\u201d (pg. 149). My response to this question would be that it's not fair to kick her off the team when she has an abundant amount of school spirit and shows her worth of staying on the team. Just because she cannot do flips or tricks, she can still cheer the team on while her other cheerleading teammates fulfill the requirements. \nChapter 9, \u201cWhat Do We Owe One Another?/Dilemmas of Loyalty,\u201d explores moral duties rooted in ties of loyalty, community, and identity, such as family, country, or religion. Sandel contrasts universal moral principles with particular obligations, for example, patriotism and solidarity. He raises the question: are we only bound by impartial and unbiased principles, or also by the \u201cmoral weight\u201d of our personal attachments? Part of this chapter asks the question of if the government and people should apologize for the sins and wrongdoings of our predecessors. Even if we did not personally harm those, and it was the previous generations, we should still acknowledge and apologize for it. For example, slavery\u2014although slavery is not a thing anymore, racism still exists, and we can acknowledge that so that history does not repeat itself. Finally, the last chapter, \u201cJustice and the Common Good,\u201d argues that justice cannot be morally neutral. Decisions about justice inevitably involve debates about virtue, purpose, and the common good. Sandel critiques liberal neutrality, like Rawls and libertarianism, and concludes that a just society must engage in moral and civic dialogue about what kind of people and community we want to be. This chapter brings up one point about justice and the common good, talking about how John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama had very opposing ideas about religion in politics. John F. Kennedy felt that even though he was Catholic, he was not going to base any of his ideas or concepts on religion, knowing people would disagree. On the other hand, Obama thought that his Christianity should be involved in his politics, since the majority of America would be influenced and believe the same as him. Personally, I think religion has no place in the government or politics, especially in America, knowing that we have such a diverse country and not everyone believes in religion or the same religion at all. I do understand where Obama was coming from, though, because both he and JFK were doing what would get them the most votes.\nIn the end, \u201cJustice: What Is the Right Thing to Do?\u201d pushes readers to wrestle with difficult questions about morality, fairness, and the common good. By exploring contrasting philosophies and applying them to real-world dilemmas, Sandel shows that justice is never simple and cannot be reduced to one principle alone. Instead, it requires thoughtful reflection, open debate, and a willingness to balance personal freedom with responsibility to others. His work ultimately challenges us not only to think critically about what is right but also to consider the kind of society we want to build together.",

        "text": "\n\nI think some of the critiques with utilitarianism can be valid as well. One of the points that Sandel brings up is the violation of individual rights and reducing morality to a mere calculation. While I think I tend to lean in a more utilitarian way of thinking I think these are some great points. I think in some scenarios there\u2019s more than just simply making the most amount of people happy. We need to look at the motive and intention behind certain situations. I also believe what one person might consider happiness might be different from what another might consider happiness. It\u2019s all subjective. Another topic that Sandel addresses is libertarianism. He uses philosophers like Nozick to explain the specifics of what libertarianism is. The example that I resonated with is Michael Jordan. As a die-hard basketball fan who is also a Chicago Bulls fan, I thought that using Michael Jordan as an example really put this theory into perspective. During the 90\u2019s, Jordan brought the NBA much more viewership and appealed to the global market. With this new spike in viewership, I think it was only fitting that Jordan be the highest paid player in the league. Nozick presents the idea that making Jordan pay 30% of his salary(taxation) is equivalent to stealing or forced labor. \nThe main critique to this argument is the poor are more in need of the money and that Jordan isn\u2019t playing alone on the court. For this scenario, I lean both ways but I\u2019m slightly going to side with Nozieck. The Chicago Bulls didn't see nearly as much revenue when Michael Jordan decided to retire abruptly and play major league baseball. Almost all people were spending money to see Michael Jordan play, not Scottie or the rest of his teammates. While I do agree it wasn\u2019t fair how big the discrepancy of pay was between Michael and his peers, I understand why it was the way it was. Now in terms of taxation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stealing to tax someone and help the poor out. The more money you make the more you're gonna get taxed. This is a system that I believe is fair because of how hard it is for lower class people to climb and succeed in this world. I also think most people who become billionaires did something unfair and immoral to achieve that amount of wealth(not all of them). I understand the frustration of people who made their money legitimately and worked extremely hard for their wealth, just for 30% to be given to people who may not work nearly as hard. But I think it is moral to help our fellow neighbors and be selfless. \nAs someone who knows people in the military, the drafting vs volunteering discussion was very interesting to me. Now my initial reaction to this type of discussion is in favor of the volunteer army. From my perspective, I myself could never see myself in the military fighting for my country and millions of others are just like me. But reading this allowed me to be more enlightened on the discussion. The best critique that I heard about this argument was about lower income people. Lower income people have less of an opportunity to go to college or get economic opportunities so when the military approaches these kids with promises of benefits and pay, it\u2019s really not much of a decision. One of my co-workers just graduated high school and I was talking to him about what his future plans after high school are. He told me he was going to the military in hopes that it will pay for his education in the future. This is a situation that so many people have to go through who don\u2019t have the money to afford college. People born into a higher class are less likely to go through this situation. Wealthier citizens are less likely to serve in the military for this reason. Another argument for this scenario was the civic duty one. Sandel agrees that as American citizens it is our civic duty to serve our country if asked to. Hearing these arguments definitely make me ponder on the topic but I still would favor the volunteer army over a drafting one. \nThe idea of lying is wrong no matter the situation is something that I thought was very interesting. In the reading, the scenario is someone with an axe approaching the door looking for your friend, and asking you where he is when you know where he is. You can either lie or tell him exactly where your friend is. Kant believes that it is right to tell this person where your friend is. For this concept I really have to disagree with Kant. I think there are so many situations where telling the truth is less moral than lying. In the scenario brought up in the reading, if you tell the person where your friend is, and then he murders him, that makes you directly responsible for your friend's death. I think that lying to not hurt someone\u2019s feelings would be considered moral. I remember when I was a kid, I really wanted the new NBA 2k for christmas. When Christmas came around, I ran to the tree excited to open what looked like the new 2k. I opened the present and it was the newest Madden instead of what I wanted. Deep down I was disappointed but when my parents asked me with a smile if I liked it, I had to lie to them. I don't think that made me wrong for not wanting my parents to feel sad. Kant feels this way because he perceives lying as intentionally manipulating another person, which is true in a sense but I think lying to save a life or spare feelings is a moral thing to do. \nOne of the biggest discussions in the reading was the obligation of solidarity. Sandel believes that solidarity is essential for justice. I agree with Sandel when it comes to this stance. The topic about reparations is one that I\u2019ve actually had conversations with people with before. I think that countries that have a dark history should apologize and give reparations. Even if the people apologizing weren't directly involved, they are a part of the community that benefitted. I also think apologizing can prevent certain bad things from occurring in the future as well.  I think the mentality of \u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d is ignorant and immoral. I think as a community we owe each other respect and a helping hand if needed. \nIn terms of politics, Sandel brings up an interesting question about whether the government should be morally neutral. I remember talking in class about whether the government is overly influenced by Chirsitanity since our country is majority of the christian faith. As somebody who is a Christian myself, I tend to agree with laws and people who have my religion in mind when making policies and laws. But I also respect other religions and technically America is not allowed to favor any religion over another because of the first amendment(freedom of religion). Tying this concept with utilitarianism, a utilitarian would think it\u2019s moral to have a christian based government since it would maximize the happiness of most Americans. While a libertarian would be in favor of the government stating neutrality. I think I side with libertarians more in this matter if I put bias aside because it is more fair to Americans., . ",

        "text": "Review #1\nRawls challenges the reader to imagine designing a society without knowing our place in it. Referring to this idea of the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d which he argues, we would all choose principles that would guarantee our basic rights and ensure that inequalities would work to benefit the least advantaged. And I completely agree with that argument, and it really makes you think about this situation in an entirely new way. It forces you to confront the bias that goes on in your head that you may not even realize is there. In my own life experience, I come from a very diverse area in Baltimore, Maryland. I live 5 minutes outside of the city so over my life I have made friends who live out in the country with big houses and a bunch of land and have friends that are clumped up in small apartments barely having room for their families. Friends who are growing up never even thought of going to college as an option. I think growing up seeing both sides of the spectrum helped give me a perspective for both sides and makes me feel very grateful. This exercise and my life experience make me appreciate and respect policies like affirmative action. That if education is meant to reward merit but also serve the purposes of society, universities considering diversity and fairness is completely justified and something I would like to have in my own society to ensure a sense of fairness for all.\nAnother idea that stuck out to me is Aristotle\u2019s idea of \u201ctelos\u201d. Which meant that everything in life has a specific purpose. An example would be that the telos of a flute is to make music. But for humans and society, it is to live well and fulfill our maximized potential as social beings. Aristotle argues that justice is giving people what they deserve based on their purpose. Arguing the people should get opportunities in ways that help them fulfill their true purpose. He explains how we must consider the common good, allowing a community to thrive and for its members to live good, fulfilling lives. Aristotle's approach is different from utilitarianism and libertarianism in the way that it is not maximizing pleasure or protecting freedom. Justice is about helping people and society as a whole find their purpose and succeed. The differences between these three ideas can be expressed through this example. If your school is picking a captain for a basketball team a libertarian would argue to let the students vote. A utilitarian would argue to pick the player that will give the team the best chance at winning. And Aristotle would argue to pick who deserves the role, who will help the team grow as a whole. But with this idea comes the issue regarding who decides someone's true purpose? And whoever that is, how do you know that there is no bias towards that discussion? This especially is concerning because Aristotle excluded woman and slaves from politics because he believed that the telos of political life was reserved for men. Which in my opinion completely discredits his ideas because he is extremely incorrect. And with a society so large and diverse how could anyone ever reach an agreement regarding moral purposes.\nReading Sandel has challenged me to think critically about justice as a more in-depth concept. And reading all of these different ideas and theories has helped me to develop my own ideas. Helping me think about freedom, fairness, and purpose. I think there is a little bit of truth in all of these theories, but I do not completely reside with just one. Each contains some ideas that I may agree with and plenty that I do not. But I do see that justice requires major public reasoning about what we, as a society, value and why. And the importance in considering all perspectives and places of reasoning to better understand. In such a diverse society that process is not easy, but is absolutely necessary if we are to all understand one another and work toward the common good. Justice is less about answers but being able to question, communicate, and reflect on what kind of society we want to be.",

        "text": "17 October 2025\nSOC 433\nA Boy Broken: Midterm Reflection\n\t\u201cA Boy Broken\u201d, written by Douglas J. Engelman in June of 2023, is a story about a father\u2019s experience after his eldest son, Douglas Jr., is diagnosed with schizophrenia. The story takes the reader through firsthand events leading up to the diagnosis, the diagnosis itself, and how the Engelman family moved forward after not only Douglas Jr.\u2019s (Doug\u2019s) diagnosis, but also his death that occurred eight years later.\n\tIn his work, Engelman (2023) shares his personal firsthand experiences with schizophrenia in order to help readers better understand the mental disorder. His goal, as I interpreted it, was to assist others who have been affected by a mental disorder diagnosis, whether it be personally, as a caregiver, or simply affecting someone close to you. He rawly describes his emotions, which allows others to relate to and not feel so ashamed or just upset with themselves when they feel those same emotions. He discusses the stigma surrounding mental disorders and why this stigma has to be broken in order for society to move forward. And, in order for individuals and their families to confidently be able to reach out for help and support during one of the hardest times of their lives. Engelman (2023) describes this stigma as \u201cinhibiting recovery and a favorable life outcome for the person with mental illness\u201d (p. 29). \n\n\n\nTheories and Stigma:\n\tTheories like the symbolic interactionist and labeling contribute to the overall stigma and perception of mental illness or disorder. Once born, individuals are expected to conform to the societal ideals of \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. If a person goes against these societal norms, values, and beliefs, they face the consequence of being labeled \u201cdeviant\u201d. Edwin Lemert, an American sociologist, divided this \u201cdeviant\u201d label into two separate terms, primary deviance and secondary deviance. Primary deviance \u201cis associated with non-normative behavior\u201d (Engelman 2023:26). Engelman provides schizophrenia as an example. So, Doug being diagnosed with the mental disorder already put him in a box, labeling him deviant, though it was not his choice to not be \u201cnormal\u201d according to society, just an unfortunate circumstance. Secondary deviance is when an individual assumes their deviant identity and acts out because of society\u2019s prejudice towards them. In the book, we did not see secondary deviance in Doug; in fact, he worked diligently to be one of the ten percent with schizophrenia who go on to live a normal life. \n\tAnother American sociologist, Bruce Link, connected stigma to labeling theory. He claimed that \u201cstigma of the label \u2018mentally ill\u2019 is internalized and imposes social stresses on the individual, to which the person adapts by implementing coping strategies such as concealing the condition\u2026or the outright withdrawal of the individual from social interaction\u201d (Engelman 2023:27-28). The stigma surrounding those who are deemed mentally ill makes an already difficult situation even more difficult for both the individual and their family. A Canadian sociologist, Erving Goffman, explained how stigma applied to the mentally disordered leads them to restricted social opportunities, and changes in self-identity\u201d (Engelman 2023: 28). It is also brought up in the text that stigma impedes one\u2019s ability to recover from a mental disorder.  \n\tLater on in this paper, it will be discussed how Doug overcomes this stigma associated with his schizophrenia diagnosis and goes on to receive treatment, respond very well to that treatment, land himself a job, and be able to live on his own (like many others with the disorder cannot).\n\tWe see the author and his family also react to the stigma caused by his son\u2019s diagnosis. Originally, Engelman (2023) tried to hide Doug\u2019s diagnosis due to fear of what others would think of him as a parent, even though the diagnosis had nothing to do with his parenting. Engelman then dove into how he questioned if the diagnosis was his fault. If he had not divorced Doug\u2019s mother, if he had not moved away, if he had been more present. But all of these what-ifs are not an explanation for how or why Doug ended up being diagnosed with the disorder. The only fact that truly mattered was how the author helped his son deal with the disorder. \nIf it had not been for his unwavering support and love for his son, I do not think Doug would have been a part of that small ten percent that comes out on top, and is able to live normally (for the most part). It is truly admirable to be able to, what I felt was, experience just how much a father loves his son, how far he is willing to go, how much he is willing to do. And, in the end, it worked out beautifully; all of both Engelman and Doug\u2019s hard work paid off.\nDoug\u2019s Story:\n\tAt age twenty, Doug was diagnosed with drug-induced schizophrenia. Doug\u2019s first psychotic break was witnessed by his sister Melissa. He was outside on the back porch, repeatedly yelling the phrase \u201cWhy do they have to die?\u201d for ten minutes (Engelman 2023:6). Melissa was worried, so she called the police. Officer Thomas arrived on the scene and talked it out with Doug. The author reached out to Officer Thomas in hopes of finding answers to his questions. The officer relayed his belief that Doug may be schizophrenic and that he should be checked out by medical professionals. \n\tThe author\u2019s first experience of realizing his son may be schizophrenic occurred when he picked Doug up the morning after the incident to go to breakfast. While in the car, Doug mentioned that two people, Wendy and Dave, were always with him. Doug said that Wendy was in the car with them when it was only the author in the driver\u2019s seat and his son in the passenger seat. While in the car, Doug experienced severe pain in his abdomen. He claimed that Dave and Wendy could put their hands inside of him, and that was what was causing it. \n\tDoug\u2019s Uncle Harry, on his father\u2019s side, was also diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early twenties. The family history, and as the author mentioned later on, Doug\u2019s frequent smoking of marijuana could be attributed to the development of his disorder, but this question was not specifically answered. \n\tDoug\u2019s first experience in the medical field was at Loyola Medical Center\u2019s Mental Health unit. His father dropped him off for intake there, and he was taken right into a thirty-day program. This is where Doug was first medicated for his disorder, and he was responding well, saying it was \u201chelping him think straight\u201d (Engelman 2023:63). His first days at the facility were spent in solitary where he was heavily medicated. He then underwent individual and group therapy sessions, and eventually exposure to the rest of the patients in the facility. \n\tAfter the month at Loyola, Doug was moved to John J. Madden Mental Health Center. Madden allowed Doug more professional care, more exposure to experimental anti-psychotics, and more therapy (Engelman 2023:65). Once in the care of Madden, Doug had his first experience with a group home, where he ended up staying for nine months. During his stay at the group home, Doug experienced ups and downs. His money was taken from him, and later on, he was threatened. This threat caused Doug to return home to the author\u2019s house one day, claiming he needed to leave Madden. \n\tThree weeks after coming back to Madden from his father\u2019s, that one night, Doug disappeared. It was not until three weeks after his disappearance that Doug reached out to his father. For three weeks, Doug was out on the streets, staying at Franciscan Outreach during the nights. After the phone call, Engelman (2023) went directly to pick up his son and brought him home. They had dinner, talked, and decided it would be best for Doug to move out of the group home. \n\tDoug ended up moving into an apartment with an older man. At this apartment, Doug landed himself a job. After over half a year at this place, Doug decided he wanted to go back to Pittsburgh, where he was surrounded by family that he was missing. \n\tWhen back in Pittsburgh, Doug had moved back in with his mother and was serviced by Chartiers Mental Health/Mental Rehabilitation Center. He stayed with his mother for two years before moving out and moving in with his sister Melissa, which lasted only for a year.\n\tEventually, the author came to Pittsburgh to help with Doug\u2019s situation along with his sister and mother. They found Doug an apartment where he faced some challenges. He was continuing to abuse weed and alcohol even though he knew it was bad for him to partake in them with his diagnosis. And he was not staying consistent with his medication. While at this apartment, and hanging out with old friends Chuck and Bob, Doug found himself frequently in trouble with the police. It was in his best interest that he move, so he did. \n\tWhen Doug moved apartments, he ended up moving to a new mental health facility, Mercy Behavioral Health. It was at Mercy where Doug began to flourish more than ever before. His new therapist, Julie Gatti, helped him in ways he had not been helped before. Engelman (2023) noted that \u201cIt was clear she had reached him in a way that no one else had previously\u201d (p. 123). Doug was getting a handle on his substance abuse during this time, and his progress with his overall diagnosis became even more prominent.\n\tDoug stayed in the area but moved into his own home, where he was approved for Section 8 housing. He had made such a nice life for himself, even regaining employment at his old high school job where he installed carpeting. With all of these amazing opportunities happening to Doug, he gained \u201ca sense of purpose and optimism\u201d that his father, the author, had not seen in years.\n\tThe last time the author saw Doug in life was at Doug\u2019s Uncle\u2019s wedding. Doug was doing great. \n\tThe last time Doug and his father talked over the phone on December 16, 1988, things were really looking up for him. He called just \u201cto say how great I\u2019m doing. How happy I am\u201d (Engelman 2023:135). Doug had plans to go back to school, but sadly, three days after their last call, Doug was killed in a tragic car accident.\nSummary:\n\tDuring the eight years of living with schizophrenia, Doug became one of the ten percent to live a somewhat normal life. Tragically, that life was cut short. \n\tThis book delivers a sense of hope to its readers, whether they have experience with mental disorder or not, hope for families made up of mentally disordered individuals. With hard work and determination, people can overcome and be more than their disorder. \n\tWhile reading the book, I felt certain aspects on a personal level. When I had my first depressive episode, I was too scared to admit it to my mother. I did not want her to blame herself that I no longer wanted to live. Eventually, I had to admit it to her. So, I think this book and how the author dealt with and supported his son through his entire diagnosis and life can help others struggling to get over the \u201cshameful stigma\u201d and reach out for support. If I had not already had my conversation with my mother, I most definitely would have after reading this book.\n\nSource:\nEngelman, Douglas J. 2023. A Boy Broken. Kindle Direct Publishing.",

The American family has been rapidly changing due to shifting cultural norms, economic conditions, and policy responses. For example, marriage rates and age at first marriage have changed (Herre et al. 2025, para. 10). Mothers' labor force participation has risen, while single-parent and one-person households have increased. Likewise, blended and cohabiting families have become more common, and a growth in households identifying as same-sex couples. There is current evidence to project how these trends may reconstruct what a \"typical\" family life looks like by the year 2035.\nMultiple evidence-based trends can help us understand what 2025 to 2035 might look like, for example, regarding marriage and partnerships. After decades of declining marriage rates and increasing ages at first marriage, and a resulting drop-off in marriage counts due to the 2020 pandemic, marriage counts have recovered for the time being (Herre et al. 2025, para. 23). Trends in the data still show a smaller percentage of people marrying at an earlier age, and the share of people currently living unpartnered or cohabiting, rather than marrying, is greater than in the mid-20th century. Recent analysis has found marriage rates in the low ratings across the entire US. Still, the marriage rate is offset by a much greater share of adults who are either unmarried or cohabiting without marriage (Buck et al., 2024, para. 6-8)\nWomen's involvement in labor has increased mostly during the late 20th century, and even though the overall female labor force participation rate has been changing in the 2010s and early 2020s, mothers of children of school age still experience relatively high labor force participation rates, and many families depend on two earners in the family. Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data show that about three-quarters of mothers of children under 18 are in the labor force (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023, para. 9)\nThe amount of children living with a single parent rose steeply in the decades after 1960; by the 2010s\u20132020s era, approximately one quarter of children had spent time in a household with a single parent, and one-person households accounted for an increasing share of all households. However, some recent data show slight declines at times in the share of single-parent households (Barrett, 2022, para. 3-5). Blended families and cohabiting couples are more typical today than in earlier generations. Households headed by married same-sex couples and by same-sex cohabitating couples are also common today and increasing (Scherer, 2022, para. 1-4)\nMarriage is becoming less of a universal life experience and is now just one way to experience cohabitation among many forms that are sanctioned. For instance, many adults who form long-term partnerships will continue to delay legal marriage until later in life, once they have established careers or financial resources. Others will cohabit long-term without legal marriage, particularly when there are weakened legal and economic incentives to marry, or when couples actively prefer cohabitation over marriage to maintain flexibility\u00a0 (Fry, 2025, para. 2). Levels of overall marriage at any age will be lower than in mid-twentieth-century America.\u00a0\nBy 2035, most mothers will be engaged in paid work, but the nature of that work will be more diverse. The continued increase of remote and hybrid workplaces, greater acceptance of flexibility in employer expectations, and technological shifts will enable parents to combine paid work and caregiving responsibilities with greater flexibility. Nevertheless, wage inequality, employer-provided benefits, and unequal access to quality childcare will still constrain the choices of mothers in less-than-ideal financial situations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025, p. 2). The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on labor force participation rates for mothers with school-aged children, including findings from a recent survey indicating a significant amount of interest in telework, would also support these assumptions (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025, p. 2-3). Data show that women who are married, pregnant, or have children under age 3 are less likely to be employed in their marriages (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025, p. 14). This is because mothers are still seen as the family's caregivers and are expected to be at home taking care of the child, rather than the man.\u00a0\nBlended families and cohabitating multigenerational living arrangements are likely to be common adaptations to economic pressures and shifting social norms. Some young adults will remain in or return to their parental homes for more extended periods, while some older adults will live with adult children due to economic constraints, health needs, or preference. Rising census data on one-person households, cohabitation households, and multi-type households indicate this pluralization of family structures (Barrett, 2022, para. 3)\nBy 2035, households headed by same-sex couples will represent an appreciably larger share of family types, as they have continued to grow alongside the expansion of legal recognition and social legitimacy in the 2010s and 2020s. There are legal and social barriers; diversity in race/ethnic backgrounds, income, and parental status will only increase. Further evidence from census records of the continued increase in same-sex married households indicates this trend should persist. (Hays & Minkin, 2025, para. 3-10)\nThe future of families will differ. Families with higher incomes and better education will have more opportunities to avail themselves of flexible working hours, good child care, and housing that supports family stability and choice. On the other hand, lower-income families will continue to suffer from the same limitations as before; they will have unstable jobs, housing insecurity, and difficulties in finding affordable childcare that will not be available in their neighborhoods, which will lead to the rise of complex living arrangements and children with different fathers in some areas (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025, p. 4-6)\nThe shape of 2035 families will be altered by three important domains that can amplify trends: public policy, cultural change, and the technology/labor market. The expansion of publicly funded childcare, full paid maternity leave, and subsidized housing in the United States would mean that families from lower-income to high-income would have more options: in case of an economic risk, earlier childbearing would be less risky, mothers could still be in the labor force with lesser sacrifices, and single parents would get more help. On the other hand, if these policy areas stagnate, inequalities will worsen and choices will be reduced, which in turn will make it unavoidable for complex household arrangements to become survival strategies (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025, p. 6-14). If the public continues to take in different types of families, social institutions like schools, hospitals, and employers will adapt, thereby eliminating stigma and making it easier for unconventional families to live day to day.\u00a0\nThe\u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200c\u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200c American family by 2035 will probably not go back to being a single dominant type. Instead, families will have plural, layered arrangements, resulting from delayed marriage. Maternal labor force participation will be high but uneven; the number of single-parent households will remain steady; more blended families will exist; and the visibility of same-sex families will be greater. The most important questions for scholars and policymakers are which policies and cultural changes will reduce inequality and, at the same time, help shape stable, healthy family lives in diverse households? Real-world evidence, as shown in data, suggests that the only thing left is society's choice in response to those trends.\n\n\nReferences\nBarrett, K. (2022, November 17).

        "text": "SOC 433\n12 October 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection Essay: A Boy Broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first heard about my midterm assignment being based on the book, \u2018A Boy Broken\u2019 by Douglas Engelman, I was thinking it would be sadder with a family dynamic of son and father, but I never expected it to hold. as much power as it did. Engleman\u2019s book carries more than just sadness; it carries love, truth, and suffering. While reading this book, I not only opened my mind up to the possibilities of mental illness and loss, but also what it means to have hope, to be strong, and to keep going when the future seems so terrifying. \n\nEngelman starts the story by sharing his fatherhood to a son who suffers with mental illness. The book shares about Engelman\u2019s son having a psychotic breakdown. This means his mind stopped working the way it usually would. His son begins to see things and hear things that are not there or real. This unfortunate circumstance changed Engelman\u2019s entire family dynamic that day. Engelman describes how he learns about how his son's future will now be altered; he shares how he tries to help him, talks us through the raw difficulties, treatments, therapy, and the hope he held on for things to get better. \nUltimately, yes, they have good moments, some even giving more hope that his son will get better, the book takes a terrible turn and horrifying ending with his son unfortunately being killed in a car accident. Left with grief, sadness, and questions, this led Engelman to search for what this all meant for his life moving forward. \n\nI learned several things while reading Engelman\u2019s, A Boy Broken, that I think any person would agree are important, especially for teenagers growing up and those who still seem to get stuck with the short end, figuring out how hard life can be. \nStarting off, mental illness is a severe problem someone deals with every day, and it is not to be dismissed. Before this book, I had dabbled in some anxiety prescriptions and investigated therapy for myself, however I was unaware of how serious mental illness could be and how much of your life it could take over, not just for you but for those around you as well. Engelman dives into his son\u2019s mental illness and how it affects his family life, also how this was not something he could just \u201csnap out of.\u201d Mentally ill people not only are affected by themselves, but they affect those around them, the loving family, and friends by their side. Not grasping the idea of this can lead to misunderstanding, judgement, and fear. Seeing Engelman learn to listen, try to empathize with his son, and give him unconditional support even when it is scary and showed me how important it is to show grace to everyone and give kindness to all. \nAnother lesson for me was that grief comes with life but does not have to end everything for you. Engelman deals with a tremendous loss towards the end and even the beginning of the book by losing his son to a mental illness. The end of the book led to Engelman\u2019s sadness, confusion, and guilt. He tries his best to make sense of everything, he goes back and forth with questions in hopes of finding an answer, and he tries to find meaning. How to keep going in a way that supports not only his son, but others as well. He learns how to accept the idea that everything going on is out of his own hands and he cannot control it, no matter how hard he tries. I learned that grief, as horrible as it is, is not something that will last overnight. Grief is something linear, one day you feel good, and the next day you feel the same emotions twice as hard, like it had just happened again. Grief is something that changes you, something to carry with you every day, but also something that forces you to grow, something that helps you view life differently than before. \nLastly, I was reminded of the importance of hope. The book is dark, but not all dark. It has moments where you feel optimism, moments where Engelman's son seems as though he is starting to get better, when small victories are apparent. These joyous moments made the hardest parts somehow feel heavier, because you see what it could be, which makes your losses hurt more. Hope gives you the strength needed to push yourself through to keep going. Engelman had a choice when his son was diagnosed. He chose to help him fight, even though his son\u2019s future was unclear, showing that hope was helping him choose for his family. \n\nI was conflicted while reading this story, feeling all kinds of emotions, hope, love, loss, grief, pain, empathy, and optimism. Feeling for Engelman\u2019s family, wondering if his son understood, if he was getting treated correctly. I was terrified when his son would get scared or begin to suffer more. I felt so much love and admiration for Engelman, knowing he was doing his best to understand, and giving his son the vulnerability, honesty, and love still given to him so deeply. \nI will be honest, I did get angry while reading, not at anyone in the story but just at society for not understanding mental illness as they should. Sometimes, those who are sick do not get the care they need, when treatment comes too late or is wrong. \nSomething I felt connected by with the story was understanding when Engelman searched for answers as to why this had to happen and how he could have stopped it. Truthfully, I feelmoments like these more frequently than I would like to admit. I\u2019m unsure as to why I feel like I am the root cause of a problem, but due to this feeling, I tend to always look for a way to fix things or to help things get better, in hopes that instead of ruining things, I am the reason they get better.\n\nSome questions I was able to think about asking Engelman and his family while reading was, was it easy deciding to support your son with his mental illness? If someone you love was diagnosed with a mental illness, what are the limits with support? Would you still care for yourself? \nEngelman sometimes struggles with feeling like he could have done something differently, does he ever have peace with what he did do? Did he forgive himself for the things he could not do?\nAs Engelman is my professor this semester in class, was your son the only reason you starting teaching sociology with a mental illness? \nThankfully in my situation, I have never had to lose someone to death just yet, out of curiosity and the upmost respect, how do you go on with life? How do you still honor your son, but still live your life?\nThis book showed me that life throws you curveballs and puts you through horrible tragedies to teach you something unclear at the moment but will eventually benefit you later on. \nPeople we love get hurt in ways we would never imagine, and we end up in situations we cannot fix. I did learn though that even though we are unable to fix things sometimes, we are always able to choose how we respond, you can choose to be kind, you can choose commitment, and you can choose hope. \nThis book showed me that every family is different, and how every family deals with things, such as mental illness, is different. Love holds a lot but is not always enough. In this case, Engelman and his family needed understanding, professional advice, honest and sometimes hurtful conversations, and the courage to stay even when it is hard. Loss does not change how strong your love can be, love stays when it gets hard, love is honest, love is loud in a world that seems so quiet. \n\nA Boy Broken by Douglas J. Engelman is a strong but heartfelt book. It does not hide emotions; it does not pretend; it is loud. It gives you the reality of a demanding situation with an unsure future. It shows you the insight of what it looks like to go through pain, to stay when it is hard, to love when it hurts too much, and to still have hope when the world seems so shattered. \n\nI strongly feel as though this book gave me the knowledge to be more aware of others mental illness, their family life, society and the misconstrued belief of grief and loss. It reminds me that we may never truly know what someone else is going through. It reminds me to still give kindness to those who hurt me, to not judge others, and always lend a hand whenever I can. Most importantly, this book taught me that time is not guaranteed, and that I need to cherish my small victories and little moments, while I still can. Engelman\u2019s story will be carried out with me, even after drafting this essay. ",

        "text": "SOC 250-001\nSeptember 9, 2025\nReflection 1\nThroughout this first part of the semester, we focused on Michael Sandel\u2019s book titled \u201cJustice: What's the Right Thing To Do?\u201d. Throughout this book, Sandel discusses several topics within the conversation of justice and what is morally correct. Within his book, Sandel covers topics ranging from utilitarianism all the way to Rawls' difference principle. Utilizing the concepts discussed within this book, we were able to have deep conversations and evolve our understanding of morality and justice. This book further connects historical theories and ideas, as well as occasionally more modern ones, and then relates them to current issues and debates within our society. Furthermore, we were encouraged to utilize the principles within this book to take a stance on current issues and form our own opinions on such issues. \nThroughout the book, there is a common theme about \u201cwho deserves what\u201d, explaining how justice should be determined or distributed. Although each chapter is a different explanation of how to distribute justice, and an understanding of such according to different historical philosophers and sociologists, Sandals sets his major guidelines of justice in the first few chapters according to historical philosophers. Sandel draws primarily from Aristotle, explaining how he simply defines justice as \u201cgiving individuals what they deserve\u201d. He goes on to further explain and break down this concept by explaining that we determine what individuals deserve this by defining the values and virtues of our society that are worth rewarding. Sandel continues by contradicting this statement by explaining that the view of modern philosophers who define the morally correct way to define our rights of justice cannot be reliant on any particular virtue. So what is justice, and how should society break down the ways we determine who deserves what? This question is the backbone of the book, and there are a few major interpretations I have taken from the book to interpret my own understanding of justice. \nWithin the book, the utilitarianism and libertarianism concepts are essentially pitted against one another. From my own understanding as well as what I have gathered from class discussion and the video of Sandel\u2019s students, I believe most people align with a combination of the two perspectives. Furthermore, I feel as though the evolution of utilitarianism, developed later on by John Stuart Mill, is far more rational. His understanding expands utilitarianism beyond just \u201cwhat maximizes pleasure and happiness\u201d into \u201cwhat maximizes happiness for the greatest number of individuals without negatively impacting or hurting other individuals\u201d. Additionally, if you add in part of the libertarianism concept of \u201cindividuals should be free to decide with limited, if any state control\u201d into Mills' Idea, you form a more rational understanding of these three. Despite their polarity, they are concepts emerging from similar issues and therefore feed into each other. The morally right decision to make is one that causes you the most pleasure while not hurting anyone else. In this discussion, one should also be free to make decisions with limited governmental control, considering it is your discussion. This understanding of combining the three major principles additionally aligns with most of my decisions regarding the political climate. \nTo further explain my belief system formed from these three major concepts within the book, I will relate it to current political debates. Firstly, this concept aligns with my stance on abortion. To my understanding, through these principles, the state should not regulate abortion until 16 weeks. I believe that giving individuals the right to be able to choose for themselves what they want to do regarding their own personal situation is the morally correct decision. Whether an individual decides to get an abortion or not does not directly negatively impact anyone else (it is their own body and their own decision). Furthermore, being given the decision positively impacts them and allows them to choose for themselves. However, I have set up the guideline for myself to limit them to around 16 weeks (with potential for exceptions because there are always exceptions). This time frame typically marks the start of the fetal nervous system development and, therefore, potential for fetal pain. At this point and beyond, I personally believe it may be morally wrong to get an abortion because of the potential pain felt by the baby and how developed it has become. This would further fall into the concept of utilitarianism by Mills, where he states that so long as it does not \u201charm other parties\u201d. Overall, I believe that I can apply the logic and morality I have developed to multiple political and moral debates and take a stance on them. \nThe last major topic is the idea of equity versus equality, and how that would function within our society. The major perspective brought up in the book is Rawl\u2019s, which brought forward the idea of everyone having equal opportunity as well as the demand for social and economic inequalities to benefit those least advantaged. I believe from my own logic, the most important perspective of those two parts is the latter. Although I believe it is important to have equal opportunities, I fear as though with the way our society functions, that will be difficult to conjure. I believe most efforts should be placed in changing the system in a way that allows for ( most likely after the fact) the social and economic benefit, mainly to the least advantaged. I see this likely occurring in the way we organize taxation, possibly creating more equitable means (instead of simply equal). More real-world interpretations of this concept are specifically the issue of taxation. As stated specifically in Sandel's lecture (within the YouTube video), is it morally right to create more equitable stances through means of taxation? Although this concept is very controversial, I believe and, according to Rawls' perspective, it would be morally correct. Taxation is a way to \u201ceven the playing field\u201d. Taxation like this could allow for almost a redistribution of wealth in such a way that it benefits though socially and economically disadvantaged. I would not necessarily consider it \u201ctaking\u201d from those with more money,  but simply a means to create more equitable stances. I do acknowledge that this may contradict my earlier development of the utilitarian and libertarian perspectives. The contradiction lies specifically within the ideas that if this taxation redistribution occurs, it would be directly harming those with higher economic and social standing. As stated in Sandel\u2019s lecture, it could be considered \u201cslavery\u201d (free labor/work without compensation). I believe that regardless of whether there is a slight redistribution or not, a party is already harmed. Furthermore, I argue that those individuals in the top economic percentile may have only gotten there through insincere means, specifically through the exploitation of those in the lower classes. I argue that maybe it is important to consider how they obtained that wealth, especially when considering the redistribution of it. \nAnother major debate discussed was the topic of affirmative action. The question of is it morally correct to prioritize certain factors while accepting individuals into the workforce and college admissions? From my understanding of this debate, I recognize that the factors that they are adding (despite just merit) are factors of minority groups. I argue that this adds into Rawls\u2019 perspective about ensuring inequalities benefit those less advantaged. I argue that those merits are already biased with the results regarding the unfair distribution of funds to different school districts, and affirmative action could be a means to balance the afteraffects of those inequalities. These inequalities are also deep ridden and come from bias of language, funds, opportunities, etc. If there are no attempts to balance the inequalities through aiding those least advantaged, then the system will continue to be corrupt and unfair. Without the implications of affirmative action, this bias continues into college and secondary education then continues to bleed into the workforce. I argue that it is what causes generational disadvantages, further setting in stone the unfair class system. \nOverall, throughout this book, I have noticed the evolution and development of my stance and morality on such difficult topics. Through this reading, I have been able to shape my understanding of morality and justice while also applying it to the current political situations. It is important to allow yourself to feel empathy and understanding for others' situations and think more critically about the root of these very sensitive debates and issues. It is important to discuss issues such as abortion, gun control, and the wealth gap. Individuals need to develop their own rationale on such a topic. The media present that the social climate is currently very divided on such topics, but I believe that more individuals are most likely on the middle ground of these topics but it is necessary to debate and have conversations to be able to discover that fact. This book has allowed for my own personal exploration of such topics especially alongside the aid from the class discussions we have. This book has continued to allow me question the systems we have set place in society, wondering how corrupt is the economic and social workings of our world? ",

        "text": "SOC 345-001\nOctober 24, 2025\n\u201cThe Family\u201d in Ten Years\nFamilies in the United States have evolved significantly over the years. The nuclear family is no longer the only type of family accepted in society. Diverse families have become more common, including same-sex families, single-parent households, and interracial families. There are more women in the workforce and more men taking on caregiving roles. Marriage rates are declining, and people are deciding to have children later in life or not at all. Ten years from now, these things will only be more prominent. \nMarriage rates are declining and will only keep doing so. Only 47% of households are made up of married couples. In 1970 it was 71% (Census Bureau, 2024). People are starting to wait to get married for many reasons. Cohabitation is a lot more common. People are not waiting for marriage to move in together. If people do not need to be married to live together or to even have kids, there will not be as much of a rush to get married. Divorce rates are high. Around 40% of marriages will end in divorce, which is not too promising (Bailey, 2025). It is smart to be more cautious because weddings are expensive and so are divorces. People want to wait to be financially stable before getting married. Weddings can be expensive, and a lot of people look at them as more of a symbol of achievement and success and less as a right of passage. (Walsh, 2021). \nPeople are also waiting to have children or are planning on not having any at all. Just from 2012 to 2023 the total number of children people planned to have dropped from 2.3 to 1.8 (Hays, 2025). Having children is expensive. People are reaching financial goals, like moving out of their parents\u2019 house and getting married, later in life, which means they are having children later because self-sufficiency is harder to achieve. This is because mortgage rates are up and so is unemployment. (Medaris, 2024). Childcare is expensive and most families cannot afford to have one parent not working. Some couples are scared to have children because of climate change. About 39% of young people are hesitant to have children because of climate concerns, according to a study by Caroline Hickman, et al. Some women are even scared to reproduce since Roe v. Wade was overturned. They feel their reproductive rights are being threatened and bringing a daughter into that world is scary for them (Medaris, 2024). About 44% of adults below the age of 50 say they most likely will not have any kids at all (Brown, 2021). Women also may not want to take on the responsibility. When having kids, most of the negative sides affect the mother. She is more stressed, has lower life and relationship satisfaction, and has career disadvantages (Reich-Stiebert, 2023). Women are normally the parent that takes on emotional role, which can take a toll on someone. The social and political climate does not seem like it is going to change within the next ten years, so the fertility rate will most likely stay the same or even decline even more. \nFamily structures will become less traditional. More women are entering the workforce and in turn, more mothers are entering the workforce. For a lot of families, it is hard to support a family with one income, so mothers entering the workforce is not always out of want, but sometimes necessity. Mothers in the workforce have a harder time than non-mothers and men. They suffer a penalty that other women who are not mothers and men do not. They are perceived as less committed and incompetent compared to their coworkers, held to a higher standard, and paid less. Mothers are less likely to be promoted or recommended for hire. Their starting salaries are 7.9% lower than non-mothers whose starting salaries are 8.6% lower than fathers (Correll, 2007). People have started recognizing that being a mother is not a woman\u2019s entire identity, so the motherhood penalty will be less prominent in the future. This also has to do with the fact that more men are taking on the caregiving role and staying home. It is becoming more normalized for a woman to be the breadwinner and the man to stay home. In the future it will be even more common, which will cause people to respect women in the workforce even more. \nSingle parenting households are on the rise. The United States has the highest rate of single parenting in the world. About 23% of children live in a single-parent household (Kramer, 2019). The decline in marriage rates is a contributing factor and the rise in divorce rates. It can also be a lot easier being a single parent now because of help from community and extended family. It is common for a grandparent to help raise a child because of the amount of help needed. In the future this will be more normalized because it does take a village to raise a child. Even if the child is not part of a single-parent household, there is still a possibility that both parents work, so there is still help needed in taking care of the child. This opens up into complex family structures. Sometimes a household consists of both parents, children, and grandparents. This can be more economically efficient, and it gives the parents an extra set of hands to help raise their children. \nSame-sex marriage, another non-traditional family structure, has been legal in the United States since 2015. Since then, same-sex families have been on the rise. There has been a lot of public support for this movement. Despite all the support from the public, the Supreme Court has been asked to look at overturning Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage (Irwin, 2025). This does not mean that same-sex marriage will no longer be legal, but since the Supreme Court is reviewing it, it shows that society is not completely okay with same-sex marriage. In ten years, society might not feel the same. Same-sex families will still be normalized. It has only been ten years since it was legalized, and it is already a lot less stigmatized. \nIn ten years, marriage will not be something that people do just because they think they should. There will be more people deciding not to get married because it is a lot more normalized for people to do so. Fertility rates will be lower because not as many people will want to have kids or as many kids. Having children is a big step, financially, and making sure being stable enough to have children will become an even bigger priority. Family types will still be diverse, including same-sex families, interracial families, and single-parent families. Less traditional households will be seen more because it will become less stigmatized for parents to ask for help. The typical American family will not be traditional or conventional. The structure of family is always evolving and so is society, so the future is promising.\n\nReferences\nBailey, G., Stone, L., & Wilcox, B. (2025).

        "text": "SOC-250-001\n18 September 2025\nThe Argument on Morals\n\tIn \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d by Michael J. Sandel, there is a deep dive into the reasons we think the way we do about situations that we can reject or agree to. Sandel lays out different philosophical approaches in a manner that is intriguing to read and understand. Sandel does so by referencing utilitarianism and libertarianism, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, and Aristotle. He encourages the reader to think deeply about where their thought process comes from and where it can go. \n\tSandel brings up the first argument of utilitarianism vs. libertarianism with a few examples, one of them being the trolley incident. The basis of it is that you are a trolley driver in one instance, and there are five workers working on the track ahead of you. Do you kill the five workers on this track, or switch to another track that only has one? In another instance, you are watching the scene unfold but see a heavy man next to you, also watching the scene. You could push him onto the track and save the five workers. This is a moral dilemma, and the answer that you seek could be rooted in utilitarianism or libertarianism. Jeremy Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism would say that the answer would be whatever creates happiness or utility for the masses. In Sandel\u2019s book he says, \u201cThere are no possible grounds for rejecting it. Every moral argument, he claims, must implicitly draw on the idea of maximizing happiness\u201d (pg. 19). The utilitarian would sacrifice the one to save five. On the other hand, libertarianism, supports individual freedom. Sandel says, \u201cTheir central claim is that each of us has a fundamental right to liberty \u2013 the right to do whatever we want with the things we own, provided we respect other people\u2019s rights to do the same,\u201d on page 30. \n\tThe utilitarian theory would be held up in society in the real-life example of COVID-19. The coronavirus affected everyone in the world greatly, a pandemic that reached all corners of the Earth. Due to the highly spreadable nature of the virus, whole countries were put into quarantine. This quarantine shows the utilitarian value of maximizing utility, as the quarantines were put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, and minimize the amount of people sick. All of the policies put in place during COVID-19 were done so to protect people from getting the virus, therefore increasing the amount of utility. \n\tSandel brings up Immanuel Kant\u2019s philosophy, looking at his moral philosophies as well as how he agreed or disagreed with libertarianism and utilitarianism. Kant\u2019s philosophy was majorly focused on the intention behind actions. His categorical imperative, which he stated was to, \u201cAct only on that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law\u201d (pg. 60), which means to only do something with the knowing that it is correct or right. Sandel relates this to making a promise you know you cannot keep. In his second formulation Kant says, \u201cAct in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, by always at the same time as an end\u201d (pg. 61). This means Kant says it is morally right to treat people as an end, not as a means to an end. Kant also brings up how in this same vein, lying by any means is morally wrong. \n\tThis brings up the question of whether it is still morally wrong if you are lying to protect the person you are lying to or lying for the benefit of another. In Kant\u2019s theory, it is morally wrong. As in the book, Sandel\u2019s example is even if there was a murderer at the door for your friend and you lied and told them they were somewhere else, it would still be morally wrong. My own criticism of this theory is that lying is not morally wrong in all situations. I believe it would be morally correct to lie to the murderer than tell them your friend is right behind you. I believe it\u2019s the same as if you would lie for your own good, or for your own safety. I would do my best to keep my friend safe by lying to the murderer and I would feel happy that I lied to keep that person safe. I would feel like my decision was morally correct. \n\tSandel also brings up philosopher John Rawls. The big picture for Rawls was justice from fair terms. He explains in Sandel\u2019s book that his hypothetical contract has two principles of justice which are, \u201c\u2026basic liberties for all citizens, such as freedom of speech and religion\u2026it permits only those social and economic inequalities that work to the advantage of the least well off members of society\u201d (pg. 70). Rawls was also into the idea of a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d that created an equal playing field for all. The theory is that if you are behind this \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d that it makes it so your biases are unknown, you don\u2019t know the outcome of your life. It creates a more fair and equal opportunity for everyone this way. John Rawls was very focused on benefitting the least advantaged. The \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d was a way to do so as you don\u2019t know what kind of life you will lead. \n\t Another aspect of this, is that the people in high parts of society can help those who are not as well to do. The argument is why should people who have worked long and hard to acquire that sort of status and income have to give it away. I think that if someone has worked for the money they have, they don\u2019t have to give it away. I also think that it takes a lot of contribution as well as time and effort. It\u2019s tricky when it comes to the point of influencers and celebrities making large amounts of money though. In the book, there is a reference to the pay difference between the chief justice on the Supreme Court, and Judge Judy, the latter making more than 10 times the amount the chief justice does. I feel like this is where things get weird. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily right, but since Judge Judy has a show, she makes an incredible amount of money. She is a celebrity, like Oprah and David Letterman, which doesn\u2019t come easy, but the amount that these people are making compared to schoolteachers and justices is a lot. I think it shows an interesting divide in wages in our country. \n\tSandel also discusses Aristotle\u2019s theories and what he believes justice is. Aristotle believed in the telos of the argument. He believed that the telos was the defining factor. The telos is the purpose of the argument. Sandel also writes in his book, \u201cFor Aristotle, politics is about something higher. It\u2019s about learning how to live a good life\u201d (pg. 95). The telos, or purpose, of politics is to live a good life. Politics is an essential way to express your opinions and vote for someone you see fit to lead your country. To Aristotle we are doing our duty as citizens when we engage in political discourse.\n\t An example of Aristotle\u2019s telos in real life is the allocation of art supplies. According to Aristotle, the best supplies would be allocated based on the purpose of its use. Sandel says in the book, \u201cAristotle claims that in order to determine the just distribution of a good, we have to inquire into the telos, of purpose, of the good being distributed\u201d (pg. 93). The purpose would be better suited to an artist that had the best artistic ability, not someone who doesn\u2019t know how to use the supplies. This is due to the artist with the best ability using the supplies to their best ability. The purpose is better suited to the artist with the best ability. The telos of the supplies is to be used to create art, which the artist can emulate. \n\tSandel\u2019s work explains the different theories of justice through utilitarianism vs. libertarianism, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, and Aristotle. These theories and philosophers create and answer the question of Sandel\u2019s, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d Us as people have differing opinions on this, but they can stem from these philosophers, based on what we believe is morally wrong or right. Through these different theories we can gather whether we would choose utility for all, or our individual freedom. We can understand if we agree with certain philosophers who believe lying is morally wrong at all times, that a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d will provide an equal playing field for all, and that telos is the center of an argument. My personal opinions reflect my lived experience, and Sandel\u2019s book helped me expand my thoughts on certain subjects in ways I had never thought of before. He brought up subjects that could be considered sensitive subjects, however he explained them in the ways of these philosophers which gave me new and different ideas than I had had. ",

        "text": "Midterm reflection\nThe Transformative Moment\nThe Reality of Mental Illness\nThrough the memoir, Engelman recounts detailed and at times terrifying descriptions of his son's psychiatric breakdowns, including terrifying hallucinations and the constant threat of relapse. These descriptions are not just narrative but portals into the everyday life of serious mental illness. The writer's account of the \"ups and downs\" that characterize the journey of struggle with mental illness is all too recognizable to anybody who has witnessed a loved one\u2019s struggle through psychological distress. Engelman's willingness to account for the disarray, confusion, and devastation of each episode highlights the cost of emotional anguish that such episodes exact on both the sufferer and the support network. By pursuing the point of desperation, hope, and strength that occurs, the memoir enables readers to understand the nuance of mental illness as it plays out in the moment, so that the story is not merely that of an individual family but a symbol for many others who fight similar struggles.\nThe power of the book lies in its refusal to sentimentalize or trivialize the experience of mental illness. Engelman presents to us the reality of watching a child endure diseases that defy easy explanation and quick fixing. His account resists the shame that so often clings to mental illness without negating the real challenge of figuring these problems out as a family. By showing the truth of everyday uncertainty, emotional exhaustion, and moments of hopelessness, Engelman provides an image of mental illness that is both genuine and compassionate. He invites readers to move beyond stereotypes or misconceptions and instead bear witness to the courage and perseverance it takes for both the patient and the family members. In doing so, the memoir is an effective instrument of empathy, opening up a discourse regarding the need for care, consciousness, and cultural change when it comes to mental healthcare.\nThe Burden on Family Systems\nMaybe the most powerful aspect of \"A Boy Broken\" is its description of how mental illness affects entire family systems. Engelman does not at all isolate the experience within his son's personal struggles but illustrates how his son's illness reconfigures the emotional, logistical, and psychological environment of everyone around him. The family will be forced to navigate their lives each day, now colored by doubt, vigilance, and worry, a climate in which each member's needs and wants can become secondary to the resolution of the crisis.\nMental illness has ripple effects far beyond the person. Families are forced to recreate their schedules, expectations, and even sense of self. Plans once taken for granted can be replaced by fear, worry, and a general sense of uncertainty. Engelman's story shows that wives, brothers, and sisters, and mothers all feel feelings of guilt, helplessness, or bitterness as they work to care for the family member in trouble. This emphasis can lead certain members of the family to feel left out or excluded, as their own emotional demands take a back seat to the pressing demands of the mental health crisis.\nSecondary trauma affects the cost sustained by those who care for someone with serious mental illness and is a recurring theme. Engelman speaks of deep sorrow and concern, not only for the health of his son, but for stability in the family and as a husband and father. Predictability and normalcy in the family generally lead to family mourning for the loss of an \"ordinary\" life. His observations closely reflect scholarly interpretations of family systems theory, which suggests that when one part of the system is debilitated by chronic illness or psychological distress, the entire system must compensate. In some instances, this adjustment also brings about beneficial restructuring, as families become more empathetic, communication becomes more robust, and new coping mechanisms are developed in response to adversity.\nMoreover, Engelman's openness about revealing instances of conflict, misunderstanding, and exhaustion among family members shows the very human instances of caregiving. He is practical in understanding that caregiving for one who has a serious mental illness is not merely a labor of love but occasionally a source of frustration, fear, and tension. These accounts cut through cultural myths of unyielding strength and unbreakable togetherness, providing an honest account of the frailties and complexities that emerge during periods of adversity.\nThe memoir also provokes reflection about wider social issues. Family members also have to cope not only with the in-house issues of sickness but with external pressures\u2014such as stigma from neighbors, friends, or even within the healthcare system. Engelman shows how these external pressures serve to build isolation on the part of families, intensifying distress and making the journey even more challenging. And yet, among these challenges, families can also find unexpected resilience. In mutual support, in moments of connection, and in a determination to keep going, many families\u2014like Engelman's\u2014build a new, though imperfect, path ahead.\nLastly, Engelman's honesty in the book is an important service to readers in that it reveals both the burdens and the bonds that psychiatric illness may impose upon a family. His book is an important contribution to mental health literature, extending consideration beyond clinical or personal records to encompass the entire family system and how it learns, breaks, and heals under stress.\nThe Search for Meaning Through Stoic Philosophy\nWith the death of his son in a car accident, Engelman embarks on a difficult path of discovery, finding solace in the philosophical principles of Stoicism as a way of coping with and surviving loss. This solution is a great model not just for insight into the situation of loss but also for living with integrity and purpose even in the middle of overwhelming loss. Engelman's tale demonstrates the Stoic idea that even things like becoming ill or dying by mishap are typically beyond our control in the external world, but our responses to such things lie within our control.\nDeath and suffering are met head-on with conviction by the Stoics. Grieving is acknowledged as a human, natural emotion and not something repressed or denied, but Stoic philosophers insist on resignation in pain as part of the tapestry of life. For Engelman, the process is embracing the pain and not refusing to acknowledge it, as one focuses on positive aspects: taking care of loved ones who survived, seeking assistance, remembering past experiences, and attempting to tell the truth after destruction.\nOne of the fundamental tenets of Stoicism outlined in the memoir is what is within our control and what is not. We have no control over altering fate, warding off all disaster, or halting mortality, but we do control engaging with trouble with intelligence and compassion. Engelman's ability to confront his grief head-on, and to make productive inferences from it on his own behalf and others', serves to validate the philosophy in life.\nIn addition, Stoic thought promotes the cultivation of gratitude for what is lost as opposed to mourning what is lost in absence. Seneca, another leading Stoic, promoted consideration of the beauty of being together and how those no longer with us shaped us, as compared to allowing absence to cheapen lived moments and the plenitude of memories. This helps to convert mourning into an even deeper love of the ephemeral nature of life.\nEngelman's own case also reveals that Stoicism is not a denial of emotions, but a healthy working through of them in the moment. Mindfulness practice, present moment living, and acceptance of impermanence are all coping mechanisms for loss. Accepting what can\u2019t be changed becomes part of an everyday coping mechanism to continue onward. By interweaving these practices, Engelman shows how philosophical examination can help us transform loss into wisdom and resistance and new purpose, neither forgetting but internalizing it as a necessary part of the human experience. Thus, \"A Boy Broken\" is not merely a survival guide to tragedy but a guide to drawing on loss as fuel for growth, empathy, and self-awareness. Engelman's embracing of Stoicism provides the language and protocol to those who are traversing through grief.",

        "text": "Reflection #1\nSoc-250-001\n9/20/2025\n\nIn chapter one Sandel discusses price gouging. He introduces three main ways people think about justice utilitarianism, libertarianism and promoting virtue. He points out that even though prices are based on consumer spending, there are needs and wants in a free market. For example, insulin is extremely overpriced by manufacturers such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The lack of competition in the market allows them to set high prices and extract significant profits. In this case, \u201cbuyers under duress have no freedom\u201d. This allows readers to realize that questions of justice are not just abstract theories but real issues that affect daily life and politics. \nIn chapter two I learned a lot about utilitarianism. When combined with other moral philosophies it is good but by itself can be very dangerous. Sandel discusses throwing Christians to lions because the people in the audience outweighed the people being thrown in.  When Sandel writes about torture I believe the utilitarianism point of view makes a strong argument when it comes to saving the lives of others. I believe if someone kidnapped just one person and wouldn\u2019t tell anyone where they are they deserve to be tortured for the information. This is equivalent to violating the rights of a minority if it benefits the majority. The police want to know where the person is and the only way to figure it out is torture. I question at what point someone\u2019s rights should be violated if it benefits the majority and how this should be determined. \nIn the Ford Pinto case, it shows how a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis might decide to pay settlements for injuries rather than fix a safety defect. I feel like when it comes to exploding gas tanks on cars that no one should ever be allowed to drive them. Of course, the company would take a loss but it\u2019s their fault in the first place. Unless the people driving them consent to the risk before or after buying them. This is another example of how, \u201cbuyers under duress have no freedom\u201d. You buy a car then find out it explodes wouldn\u2019t you want your money back? I feel like the best option in this case is for Ford to take all the cars back and fix them. Then sell them again. All the people who bought one and figured out it was exploding should have been able to get their money in exchange for the car. \nIn chapter three I found different than the other chapters. It introduces Robert Nozick and his argument for a minimal state focused on protecting individuals from force, fraud, and theft, asserting that individuals have rights over their own bodies, talents, and the fruits of their labor, even if it leads to unequal distributions of wealth.  Sandel discusses individual liberty, self-ownership, and the importance of voluntary transactions in a just society.  This chapter helped me understand the reason for unequal distribution of wealth and why it is necessary. Sandel notes that market exchanges are not always as voluntary as libertarians suggest, particularly when there are vast inequalities. Severe economic necessity can create unfair bargaining conditions that undermine the idea of truly free exchange.\u00a0\nIn chapter four Sandel discusses markets and morals. Sandel makes the point that if an army is 100% volunteer there are still people who have no other option but to join because of personal circumstances like poverty or homelessness. He argues what choice do they really have if the only job for them is the army. \u00a0Sandel challenges the idea of a completely neutral state by arguing that involving markets in these areas can erode civic virtues, such as solidarity and shared responsibility, and may not always lead to the greatest good for the greatest number.\nChapter five focuses on the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This philosophy makes the argument that justice is rooted in human dignity and autonomy rather than consequences or markets. The categorial Imperative is Kants moral principle. It teaches you about universality, which is only acting on principles that could become universal law. Another concept in Kants moral principle is humanity as an end. This is treating humanity as end and not as a means. This reminded me of treating others the way you would like to be treated. Sandel writes about Kant\u2019s belief that utilitarianism leaves rights vulnerable and misunderstands morality's true nature by basing it on variable consequences and desires.\u00a0This kind of goes back to the Christians and the lions where their rights where overshadowed by the majority\u2019s desires. \nIn chapter six Sandel discusses John Rawls\u2019 theory of justice. This is where I start to understand difference principles from a more theoretical point of view. Rawls difference principle holds the belief that, \"only those social and economic inequalities are permitted that work to the benefit of the least advantaged members of society\u201d (Sandel pg. 152)\u00a0should be implemented.\u00a0For example, higher doctor salaries that improve healthcare in impoverished areas align with Rawls\u2019s principle, while those that only benefit the wealthy do not. Rawls emphasize looking at the overall system of a society like taxes and their effects on the poor rather than just looking at individual salaries. Sandel makes the point that affirmative action should not be viewed as a reward for merit or virtue. According to Dworkin, universities set their criteria and standards based on their specific goals, and there is no inherent right to be admitted based on any set of qualities.\u00a0Justice in admissions involves selecting students in a way that best advances the university\u2019s mission and societal goals, not simply rewarding individual merit. \nIn chapter eight Sandel introduces Aristotle's \"honorific\" and \"teleological\" approach to justice. He discusses that Justice isn\u2019t just about equal treatment, it\u2019s about giving each person what they deserve to help society achieve its proper goal, like excellence or moral growth. In our society the goal is to ensure human survival and wellbeing. When people act against these goals, judges and juries help uphold justice by holding them accountable. I learned that one of the purposes of the state is to cultivate good character among its citizens by allowing them to have political dialogue and encouraging citizens to pursue careers consistent with their nature and the state's understanding of the good life.\u00a0There are countries that don\u2019t allow free discussion of politics like North Korea. The lack of freedom in North Korea makes me question if the government is cultivating bad character among its citizens? These people have no control over their lives because of the government, so how could they present good character towards the country?\nIn chapter nine Sandel discusses what one person owes to another. He does this by examining moral individualism and collective responsibility. One of Sandel\u2019s examples involves a French bomber that has been ordered to bomb is own village. Sandel asks, \u201cWhat do you make of the pilot\u2019s stance? Do you admire it or consider it a form of weakness?\u201d I think about the other villages the pilot may have bombed. Why are his friends and family worth more than the friends and family of others. This is why I view the pilot\u2019s decision as weak. If you can kill the friends and family of others what\u2019s stopping, you from killing your own. If you were to say because I love them then I would call you selfish for killing people who were also loved by others. This chapter reinforces Sandals previous arguments in the book that that a just society requires a moral engagement with, rather than an avoidance of, the moral questions about the good life and collective values.\nIn chapter ten Sandel discusses how cultivating a just society requires civic virtue and solidarity to promote citizens' shared concern for the community and its inherent moral purposes. Sandel introduces debates about abortion. This is where I realized that some debates are unavoidable moral and religious controversies like abortion. People who are religious are pro-life and people who believe abortion should be legal are pro-rights. I feel like these two different sides debating will not result in any progress made to each side\u2019s beliefs on the subject. In a case where progress cannot be made, is it better to avoid moral questions? This is where maximizing freedom is important because without freedom you cannot follow the other steps to cultivate a just society. \nIn conclusion, Sandel discusses moral philosophies from multiple perspectives, carefully avoiding bias and unnecessary controversy. He presents each theory fairly, allowing readers to see both its strengths and weaknesses. By making counterarguments, Sandel helps the reader understand the pros and cons of each moral philosophy he introduces, showing that no single approach has all the answers. He also includes real-life examples, historical cases, and current events, which allow for deeper thinking about the rights and wrongs of each complex moral dilemma he writes about. This method makes abstract ideas easier to understand and connects philosophy to everyday life. Through his balanced approach, Sandel encourages readers not only to grasp different views of justice but also to reflect on their own beliefs, question their assumptions, and engage in thoughtful debate about what it truly means to live in a just society.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sociology of the family\nOctober 24, 2025\nThe Future Of The Family\n \tSince the late 1970s, America has seen a steep increase in dual earing households, single parent households, same sex relationships, and a decline in marriage rates as a whole. This change can be attributed to many things or even viewed as a domino effect. This begs the question: What would the average family in the United States look like 10 years from now? Personally, I believe we will see this trend to continue due to the implementation of more women than ever before being able to walk about from relationships that do not serve them or joining the work force, as well as same sex relationships being slowly more accepted than in the past. The combination of these factors will make it so we see an overall decrease in families with For starters, I don\u2019t think there will be as many families to start with in 2035. Obviously, you don\u2019t need to be married to raise a family, but it is how a great majority of families start. With fewer marriages, there will be fewer families. \u2018In 2024, only 47.1 percent of households had a married couple, which is only second to the lowest marriage rate in 2022, where the all time low was represented by 46.8 percent. Compared to 75 years ago, you could see as much as 78.8 percent of households were those of married couples. Since 2010, the rate of married couple households has never risen back to above 50 percent. This can partly be attributed to not only men but also women marrying later in life. As stated on USAfacts.org, \u201cBoth men and women are marrying later in life. In 2024, the average age for a first marriage was 30.2 years for men and 28.6 for women. The Census has tracked marriage ages since 1890. In that time, the youngest median ages of marriage were in 1956, when it was 22.5 for men and 20.1 for women.\u201d Another factor in the decrease in marriage rates is that since the 1980s, the life expectancy has increased. The rush to marry decreases when there\u2019s more life to live compared to other generations. The combination of a longer life expectancy and lower rates of marriage can both factor into the future. Following current trends, it looks like 2035  won\u2019t have as strong of a push to marry overall, greatly impacting how many families there will be in 2035. \nDaul income families are on the rise due to the overwhelming current cost of living. This is no new trend. We first saw women join the workforce in the late 19th century to cope with a lack of men available to work during the war period. This trend never slowed down, and we can now see that about half of the families today are a part of a dual earner household structure. Additionally, dual earning families have a higher likelihood to have fewer children as compared to single earning household structures. This is often because married couples of dual earning households are more often to be career driven whereas having children could put a halt to this drive. Cloudninefertility states:  Both men and women in the current society are highly ambitious and want to priorities their careers. They are more focused on investing their energy, time and money in achieving their career goals. They do not want to impact their career by taking time off for parenthood and potentially limiting their opportunities for career advancement.  Bearing a kid and raising them means less freedom and flexibility. DINK couples usually like their freedom and want to enjoy the spontaneity of travel, leisure, etc and do not want to be constrained by responsibilities. They want to invest time and money in self-care, personal development and relationships rather than looking after kids.\u201d Overall, with a dual income career driven couple, its less likely to see more children in their future. This contributes to my belief that we will see less families overall in 2035. However in the rise of dual income household structures, it is also important to consider that there are households without this option, single parent households. \nThe rise of single parents can never be pinned down to just one specific reason, there are too many factors, lifestyles, situations, and stories to make a blanket statement on how this comes to be. However, one large outcome of being a single parent household is that it is extremely more likely to see fewer kids once the parent of the household is single. The cost to raise a child is no small feat and having a single income of a single parent, the cost to have multiple children may not be possible. There has been a steep increase of single parents from earlier years to now. More specifically, the percentage of single parent households structures is 25 percent of total families as compared to the previous 9 percent, as seen in the 1960s. As stated in niussp.org, \u201cFor decades, the share of U.S. children living with a single parent has been rising, accompanied by a decline in marriage rates and a rise in births outside marriage (Livingston 2018). The percentage of US children living in single-parent households nearly tripled between 1960 and 2023, increasing from 9% to 25% (US Census Bureau 2023). In the same period, the share of households with fathers missing more than doubled, increasing from 11% to 25%\u201d This is why I  believe the increase of single parent households will contribute to the decrease of families with children in 2035. Furthermore, with an increase of same sex marriages, there is less opportunity to have children. \nSame sex relationships have always been around, but not widely accepted until recent years. In fact, same sex marriage wasn\u2019t fully legalized until June 26, 2015. With same sex couples, there are limited ways that a child can become a part of the family. These options can be incredibly expensive and even if it is a feasible cost there is still incredible amounts of discrimination that these couples face. This contributes to the difficulty of bringing a child into the home but it also contributes to the decision for some of These couples to not pursue a family with children. A recent study of LGBTQ individuals experience in the foster/adoption process stated after rigorous research that \u201cIn light of their interest in foster care and adoption (Goldberg, 2012), LGBTQ people should be regarded as highly valuable assets by the child welfare system and adoption agencies (Brooks & Goldberg, 2001; Mallon, 2011), yet they continue to face challenges at various stages of the adoption or foster care process. Such challenges may delay the placement of children in their home, or the legal adoption of those children, and/or result in disruption of those placements.\u201d This barrier contributes to a decrease in families with children, and I predict this trend will unfortunately continue to increase into the year 2035.\nWorks Cited\nChamie, Joseph. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Single-Parent Households and Missing Fathers  - N-IUSSP.\u201d N-IUSSP, 13 Jan. 2025, www.niussp.org/family-and-households/americas-single-parent-households-and-missing-fathers/.\n\u201cDink (Double Income, No Kids) Trending and Fertility Declining!\u201d Www.cloudninefertility.com, www.cloudninefertility.com/blog/dink-double-income-no-kids-trending-and-fertility-declining.\nGoldberg, Abbie E., et al. \u201cLGBTQ Individuals\u2019 Experiences with Delays and Disruptions in the Foster and Adoption Process.\u201d Children and Youth Services Review, vol. 106, Nov. 2019, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104466.\nNews, PBS. \u201cWhat to Know about the Supreme Court Ruling That Legalized Same-Sex Marriage 10 Years Ago.\u201d PBS News, 26 June 2025, www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-know-about-the-supreme-court-ruling-that-legalized-same-sex-marriage-10-years-ago.\n\u201cSame-Sex Parents and Their Children.\u201d Humansyst.org, 2020, www.humansyst.org/Human%20Systems/Consumer_Updates/Same-sex_Parents_and_Their_Children.aspx.\nUSAFacts. \u201cThe State of Relationships, Marriages, and Living Alone in the US.\u201d USAFacts, 14 June 2023, usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/.\n\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 345\n24 October 2025\nProjected Marriage Trends in 2035\n\tAs we progress in the United States, we stray farther and farther from traditional Western ideals. It is already apparent that men are no longer considered and expected to be the only source of income and the \u201cbreadwinners\u201d of a household. Today, more women than ever before are in the workforce, and their life goals often do not include being a stay-at-home mother, nor do these goals perceive marriage as the end-all be-all. As a society, we are shifting our focus away from basing our entire lives on getting married, having children, and starting a family. \n\tWhen comparing current marriage trends to the past, it is evident that fewer people are getting married, and those who do eventually get married do not do so until later on in life. The legalization of gay marriage also shifted the way society views marriage. Instead of it being a legal recognition of a union between a man and a woman, it can be applied to any two persons in any scenario. \nDeclining Marriage Rate:\n\tWhy are we seeing a decline in marriage? To simply answer the question, in today\u2019s society, people are more career-driven. Marriage no longer marks the start of adulthood. Going to school, graduating, and becoming successfully employed are goals now put ahead of settling down with a partner and starting a family. Recently, individuals are seen not even wanting to think about marriage until they are well off enough financially and can provide a nice life for themselves. Welcoming a partner into one\u2019s life takes attention away from their job. It jeopardizes mental well-being for those who are doing just fine remaining single. When in a relationship, marriage especially, you have to put your partner's needs above your own, and this can become difficult when an individual has devoted their life to their job.  \n\tWith so many women involved in the workforce today, the societal pressure of getting married to a man so that you can be taken care of and provided for is lifted. Women can now easily provide for themselves. The traditional ideal that pictured men as providers and women as dependent on the men to provide made it seem as though marriage was a necessity and an expectation. If you were older and unmarried, you were originally viewed as having failed at life. Nowadays, with women focusing on their education, careers, and overall independence, the pressure to get married is now not as intense. It is abundantly evident that men and marriage are not necessary to live a fulfilled life. If one is happy single, why risk that happiness in order to gain a partner? \n\tAnother reason that can be attributed to declining marriage rates is the fact that people do not view the label of marriage as necessary to prove their love and commitment to one another. At the end of the day, it is quite literally just a piece of paper. The legal recognition of a union between two individuals does not affect the relationship itself. Those in long-term cohabitation relationships may see no real reason to get married. It has been evident throughout their whole relationship that they love and care for one another and want to spend their lives together as they have been doing over the past years. There is no real reason that they would need to go out and get married. Other factors, like the price of having a wedding, also deter people from getting married, as well as the fear of divorce. \n\tSingle parenting creates another reason that people either choose not to marry or get married later on in life. A single parent raising a child places all of their attention on raising that child. There is no time to go out and meet someone, much less get to know them on a deeper level, when raising a child at home. Single parents may also not feel comfortable bringing essentially a stranger around their young children. From personal experience, though my mother was married to my father at one point, at two years old, they got a divorce. My whole upbringing, and to this day, I never saw my mother with another man. Growing up, I would ask her why she did not try to find someone new, and her response was always that I came first, and she did not feel comfortable bringing random men into the house to meet me. It was not necessary for her to find another partner and remarry. A single parent with a child in the house places that child and their needs above all else (most of the time). Now that I have been out of the house for some time, I still ask my mother why she does not try and find love again, and as I stated above, as people are completely fine with being single, that is also her mentality. She says that she has been single for almost twenty years, and she does not even want to stress about another person coming into her life. She is content with the way her life is and does not need some man coming into her life and creating stressors she would not otherwise have while remaining single. This perspective can also be applied to single mothers who were never married, thus why single parenting impacts the declining marriage rates. \nLGBTQ Couples:\n\tAs we have seen, the declining marriage rates are impacting original marriage ideals, and the legalization of gay marriage has also shifted views of what a traditional marriage looks like. No longer is marriage seen and accepted between only a man and a woman, but now we see marriage between any two people who love each other and want to take that next step. This shift challenges society\u2019s heteronormative view of marriage by focusing the idea of marriage more on love, commitment, and connection. The commonality of same sex marriages normalizes diversity within families and demonstrates that the foundations of marriage are focused on love and trust rather than gender and heteronormacy. \nConclusion:\n\tTaking into consideration all of the points brought up previously in this paper, it is very evident that marriage trends ten years from now will look different from what we see today. Not only will there be fewer marriages due to seeing it as a non-necessity, and not prioritizing marriage as a whole, but we will also see more diverse, LGBTQ marriages in the future. \n\tInstead of marrying for security, people will marry intentionally, and later on in life, if at all. Marriage is no longer a contributing factor to the age-old \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d. Individuals will not be getting married just to be able to say they did. If a person meets a great partner and feels the overwhelming need to get married, they will. Previous pressures and rushing straight into the act will be a thing of the past. People will be seen getting married later on in life because they want to, not because they need to. Marriage is a choice, not an obligation. \n\t\n\t",

I know that there have been many instances where I have tried to register for a class that fits both a need for my degree and a want for my interests post college, but the class is full, and I must scramble frantically to try and find a replacement class. There is the argument of whether registration priority should go to seniors first as they need to put the finishing touches on their degree or the current system which goes by GPA regardless of what year you are. \n             A utilitarian would want to maximize a college student\u2019s happiness and would use a system which would prioritize certain classes for their degrees. An example would be prioritizing Criminology classes for Criminology majors so they would not have to worry about it filling up. In a 35-person class have 30 spots of that class dedicated to Criminology majors and use the same pattern for other majors. It would ensure each student gets the classes they need and want for their degree and have spots for other majors to take a class they might find interesting. There would also be the case of using a hybrid schedule for the classes that are in high demand to fit schedules of students to ensure their happiness.\n              A libertarian would likely not change the current system by much if at all. They would defer to individuals\u2019 rights to all choose the class and would not want to hinder a certain major or grade to benefit another. They would want all people to have an equal opportunity to get into a class to try and change that would infringe on an individual\u2019s rights. The wealth distribution example that Sandel uses in the book would be very similar to this as it is not fair to the wealthy to have to give some of their money because they are wealthy. It would be unfair to those students whose GPA is highest to have to give up their position in registration because there are others with lower GPA\u2019s who cannot get into the classes they need. \n            In my opinion, there needs to be a mix between what a libertarian would do and a utilitarian. I would alter it more than a libertarian would but not quite the same way a utilitarian would do. I would say that seniors would get priority as they have the most need to get certain classes as they need to graduate but I would sort the grades by GPA, so the seniors with the highest GPA would get their preference, and then the seniors get their choice and that cycle continues. Freshmen would go based on their high school GPA to reward those who put in the work to get into college. In my opinion this is the fairest way to complete registration as it considers the need of seniors to have them graduate while also rewarding academic success. There will also be more open spots for each level of course as seniors will be less likely to take a 200-level course as it will have been open to them in earlier years.\n\n             Another dilemma that arises for most college students is on campus parking. We have a system where you must pay a certain fee to park in a zone for the entire academic year. There are many students that will park in zones that are far away from their classes and must walk long distances and will end up being late for class. Areas such as the Trask lot and Hamilton lot are not feasible zones as they are near no buildings in which students have classes. It presents an issue for all off campus students that are over one mile from campus, especially since there is an uptick in students enrolled this year compared to previous years.\n           A utilitarian would prioritize the overall happiness of college students parking versus the needs of students. They would likely try a system of prioritizing those that are farthest from campus such as people that might live outside of Wilmington. They would create more park and ride situations than the ones that exist as the only one is the parking lot behind the Taco Bell across from campus. They might even incentive park and ride situations by making them much cheaper or even taking money off students\u2019 tuition to make it more attractive. Overall utilitarians would try to make as many students happy as possible even if they have other students that want to park close even if they do not need it.\n           A libertarian would want to prioritize the usage of the free market and would value each student having an opportunity to buy a parking pass. They would have the prices raised to see which students really value convenient parking as they would feel it is unjust for prices to all be the same as the zones with more convenience should be more expensive. They would leave it up to the students to decide who wants to pay for more premier parking rather than have a higher authority decide who gets what parking. A potential downside for this method would be wealthier students being able to afford the parking and it would leave other students scrambling for parking alternatives and making more students late for class. \n           I would use a system that matches students closest to the zone for their degree, and it would also be a first-come first serve method. If a student has most of their classes in Bear Hall then I would have the off-campus student park in commuter zone one which is the closest student parking to Bear Hall. I would have that system for student parking on a first come first serve basis. I would also have more parking for students as it seems that there is teacher parking in every building but not enough parking for students. It would help to divide the vast students across campus as well as to keep them as close as possible to the building they have the most classes in. My system that I feel is best would utilize the libertarian view of first come first serve while also having utilitarian views of maximizing the happiness of students whom have to park from off campus housing. \n           In the book, Sandel uses examples such as which system for supplying the military is the best or using pregnancy for pay. He discusses how the systems have changed over time from the civil war system to use of conscription, to the volunteer army we have today. The utilitarians and libertarians would both prefer the volunteer system for different reasons because of maximizing utility, and the personal freedom it gives. The libertarians would allow surrogacy as it is a person\u2019s personal freedom to be able to decide to have a child elsewhere if they could not have one themselves. The utilitarians would also support surrogacy as it maximizes happiness for a couple that cannot have a child that wants one. Overall those two issues that Sandel uses in the book happen to have utilitarians and libertarians agree on which method is the best as it aligns with both of their views for different reasons. \n           In conclusion, my arguments are ones that hit close to me as well as other college students. Registration is something I have had issues with from the start as there have been instances I have had to scramble to find classes to take after the ones I wanted filled up. It is a system that had always seemed unfair to me as I should be able to get into Criminology classes with no issue. The parking issue is one I have had to deal with as I park in the Trask Lot and it is a manageable walk, but this year has been rough as there are many more students on campus parking this year and I find myself hunting for parking in the Hamilton Lot as the Trask Lot is always full. Overall, these issues might not be life or death, but they are near and dear to me and diving into how utilitarians and libertarians would solve these issues has been insightful for me to understanding how they both think.\n       \n             \n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Issues in Social Justice\nSeptember 11, 2025\n Justice \n\tMichael J. Sandel is a well-known modern-day political philosopher, famous for his speeches and for redefining how people discuss and view traditional economic markets, according to The Decision Lab. Most of his speeches took place in lecture halls and stadiums, where he discussed economic markets, political issues, and moral & ethical codes. Sandel has authored many books about these subjects, including \u201cThe Tyranny of Merit,\u201d \u201cWhat Money Can\u2019t Buy,\u201d \u201cEquality,\u201d and others. However, this paper will analyze his book \u201cJustice: What is the Right Thing to Do?\u201d He explores moral codes, justice, and analyzes philosophers to define justice when discussing philosophical and ethical dilemmas.\n \tSandel\u2019s Justice: What is the Right Thing to Do? This prompt raises an important question as it sets the tone for the direction and discussions within Sandel\u2019s work, as he breaks down and analyzes various aspects of how philosophers and people approach this prompt. He asked: what do we consider justice to be? Sandel explores this question through three lenses: welfare maximization, freedom requests, and virtue cultivation. In the next section, Sandel introduces a philosopher who further explores into these identifiers as well as countering with critiques and addressing limitations with their ideologies.\n\tJeremy Bentham an English philosopher is known as the father of modern utilitarianism where he was known to critic both judicial and political instructions through defining fundamental concepts of ethics (John P. & Brian, 2025). Moreover, Bentham held the belief that the ultimate moral principle is the maximization of general welfare, collective happiness, and the overall balance of pleasures over pain. This reflects the utilitarian perspective, which advocates for decisions that yield the most favorable outcomes for the majority. Utilitarianism advocates for wealth distribution, positing that those with greater financial capacity can aid those in less favorable economic conditions, subsequently improving their overall welfare. Another example, pulled from his book, Sandel presents the lifeboat case, a scenario involving four English sailors adrift in a small lifeboat in the South Atlantic, who were then rescued days later (Sandel 18). Upon their rescue, only three of the four members had survived, as one crew member confessed to having eat a fellow crew are due to starvation; the surviving sailors were then taken transported back to England to be tried for their crimes (Sandel 18). Sandel presented this scenario to illustrate that Bentham and other utilitarians would condone the sailors\u2019 actions, as their philosophy prioritizes maximizing overall happiness. The sailors in question were affected from extensive famine. If sacrificing one sailor benefits the survival of the other crew mates, their actions are morally justified. Those who condemn the sailors\u2019 actions would be unjust. In the following section, Sandel will present a counterargument and philosophy to the utilitarian perspective. While clarifying these philosophical stances, ideals, and specific aspects of utilitarianism, as this perspective presents a contrary viewpoint. Moreover, this contrasting viewpoint challenges the core principles of utilitarianism in moral judgement. \nThe utilitarian perspective, which prioritizes communal satisfactions and happiness, is at odds with individual rights, as it does not respect them. This stands for a core principle of libertarianism, as their philosophical positions emphasize self-ownership, given that individual have dominion over their individual rights, personhood, and efforts, \u201cI am entitled to the fruits of my labor.\u201d Libertarians advocate for a free market, minimal government intervention & regulations, oppose wealth redistribution, and prioritize individual liberties and the maximization of individual happiness. For instance, libertarians do not support a neoliberal economy because of their opposition to government involvement in the market; they view government spending and taxation as slavery. From this perspective, which is based on individual ownership and labor, taxation is a violation of these principles because of the government\u2019s confiscation of an individual\u2019s income without producing or contributing to said labor. This association is further emphasized because libertarians view taxation as a coercive practice by the government, with potential punishments including financial penalties, assets taken, and/or incarceration for those who do not pay their taxes. \n\tHowever, Sandel critiques the libertarian viewpoint, challenging its fundamental principles and the bases of societal and systematic justice. Initially, he contests the notion that taxation equates to slavery. He counters this belief with several arguments, for instance, in the United States (US); should and individual contest the taxation of their earnings, they are eligible to vote on reforms. This argument specifically argues taxation as slavery, as those enslaved cannot advocate for their interests or their labor. The following argument proposes that individual accomplishments are not the product of personal effort or hard work. Instead, success may arise from chance, or an individual\u2019s background, as an individual\u2019s talents and skills vary across communities, and some of these factors are considered in achieving success. Sandel\u2019s argument is that success is not achieved indefinitely; rather, the individual, the community and one\u2019s surroundings foster success, and the resulting benefits should be attributed to that community. In essence, Sandel further argues that libertarianism places excessive focus and priority on the self, individual ownership, and absolute freedoms. This ideology overlooks societal duties, restricts the perspective of freedom & rights, devalues communal support, and does not acknowledge that people are part of a broader social structure. \n\tTo clarify and explain the fundamental principles of some philosophical perspective discussed in Sandel\u2019s \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d When discussing the concept of justice, I ask myself similarly to Sandel\u2019s question, which stance would serve as a greater or a morally just perspective to follow. Additionally, how is justice perceived within our society? My personal beliefs and ethical framework are aligned with utilitarian principles, which prioritizes the maximize of overall well-being. I prioritize collective support and reject individualistic expectations, as well as any actions that marginalize others to achieve self-ownership. My stance is in favor of wealth distribution, which is based on the idea that the wealthy continuously accumulating wealth, justifying it with the mindset of \u201cself-owned success,\u201d which hinders efforts to alleviate the suffering of others. I find the current mindset and systems, such as capitalism, that perpetuate wealth accumulation problematic, and closing this gap will require several generations. In addition, that wealth is preserved through exploitative methods where individuals, specifically workers, are required to provide labor with little to no returns. This worsens community suffering while solely promoting and upholding the happiness of a single person. However, I acknowledge the disadvantages and drawbacks of the utilitarian perspective, such as the ultimate disregard for individual rights and its failure to recognize human complexities and our placement in society. The utilitarian approach emphasizes the outcomes of actions and their effects on collective happiness, potentially overlooking those who do not align with the majority\u2019s views. Additionally, some individuals may be unwilling to relinquish their independence rights because of personal values, beliefs, morals, and experiences. In addition, utilitarianism focuses on the overall happiness of the group, weighing the pleasure and pain instead of the moral rightness or wrongness. Those who judge society from a utilitarian perspective risk framing their discussions and decisions about collective happiness, neglecting the inherent morality of actions done for the benefit of the majority. This introduces complexities in justice and in deciding the fairness of personal decisions. Integrating philosophical ideologies into our systems requires acknowledging their limitations in providing a comprehensive framework for society. While I support utilitarian principles, I also agree with certain aspects of libertarianism related to government involvement and individual labor rights. The prioritization of one philosophical perspective over others restricts the understanding and nuance of intentionally flawed systems, societal norms, and individual behaviors within their prescribed roles.  An individual\u2019s experiences influence their decision-making and moral compass, considering values vary across national, cultural, communal, and individual lines. Each viewpoint possesses inherent strengths and weaknesses, and its applicability is limited by the context; however, by analyzing and dissecting these perspectives, we can acquire a clearer understanding of what justice may entail. \n\tJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do, by Michael J. Sandel confronts a multifaceted question relating to societal justice and how it operates within our society. Throughout the text, the author examines this theme from various philosophical perspectives. The primary focus of this paper was libertarian and utilitarian perspectives, which resonated most strongly with me in Sandel\u2019s writing. Examination of these aspects within the book not only educated me of these perspectives but also highlighted their alignment with my personal moral and ethical stances. Reading Sandel\u2019s work enhanced my comprehension of diverse justice explanations, while simultaneously receiving clarity on my own personal moral framework. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tReferences\nRichardson, Sarah.

        "text": "Midterm Reflection Essay\n10-17-2025\n\nSociology of mental disorder points out that stigma has many factors which influence its severity and sources in a given community.  Doug's journey with schizophrenia exemplifies how an individual, on a micro level, is impacted by these community or society level shifts in stigma. Doug\u2019s experiences have reminded me of many of my own, and I\u2019ve considered how the two might relate to certain concepts from the aforementioned text.\n\tStigma impacts both Doug and those around him throughout his journey both directly and indirectly.  Doug ends up being targeted for repeated robberies at a place he stays which houses other patients; it's likely he was targeted due to a symptom of schizophrenia that results in the patient being \u201cgullible\u201d. Doug's family also puts up with constant pressure from the responsibilities of a caregiver, but also pressure from whether or not to reveal the nature of Doug's condition to their neighbors and extended family out of fear for how that might change their relationships.  While in the latter example there is no form of harassment or bullying taking place which would constitute what one might think of as prejudiced, stigma is more often an internalized process which impacts one's decisions and leads to such isolation of specific groups.  I have spent some time in mental hospitals when I was a teenager for suicidal intent, and recall a similar kind of stigma.  Even though I was on the inside of the hospital there was still a palpable sense of defensiveness between the patients; when we came in, and whenever someone new came in or was admitted, they specifically warned patients not to get anyone's contact information and that this isn't a place to socialize. While that is a good warning considering the circumstances, it made us feel like we were in danger from everyone else in the facility. There was one particular patient who was 17, it was a juvenile unit, and during my stay he was having his 18th birthday which meant he was transferring to the adult unit; the nurses frequently warned him about the adult unit and pushed him to leave the hospital altogether before he would be transferred there.  These warnings and feelings of danger come from the outside stigma of \u201cpeople with mental disorders are inherently dangerous\u201d.\n\tThese stages of grief experienced by caregivers reminded me of many events from my life and how they have impacted my family members. The one that I would say creates the emotions most synonymous with grief is epilepsy.  They go through a lot of stress and effort managing my seizures and repeatedly saving me from them; my brother has had to kick through my door multiple times and my mother once broke a window to get to me.  On the rare occasion when they don't do these things fast enough they have found me blue from oxygen deprivation.  Although this isn't a mental disorder they certainly qualify as caregivers; they're always ready at a moment's notice to run upstairs or to wherever they heard me fall, and if they don't know where I am for a long enough period of time they get anxious and call me or contact me. I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 15 and early on in the process my neurologist said that some people are able to grow out of epilepsy until age 25 (I\u2019m 26 now). I never had hoped that that would happen for me, however my mother always clung to it as a chance that I wouldn't need this constant supervision and other interruptions to my life.  Retrospectively, she does seem to have gone through a very similar process of denial and grief.\n\tWhen searching for Doug, it is mentioned how the homeless seemed so invisible before, but now that he is somewhere in that crowd you realize how many homeless people there are.  Later, while having lasagna with Wendy and Doug, he mentions that he met a nice group of homeless people who could tell he didn\u2019t know his way around the streets so they offered to help him out; the event led to a revelation that a widely held stigma, in this case against the homeless, is untrue.  This moment reminded me of an experience I had which led me to the same revelation; I was sitting in a park on Market Street, trying to gather myself after a stressful day, and a man  who I had passed by a few times on the street downtown before walked up and sat on the bench beside me. I thought nothing of it at first, but I was as anxious as I am with all people. Then he spoke to me about how he is God and he thought I was some incarnation of a spirit of some kind that he didn't fully explain the nature of.  I was somewhat unnerved by this as the two of us were alone, so I downplayed it and treated the God and spirit stuff as a conversation topic; we talked about his family as well, but he was more interested in the former topic.  It was at this point that he took out a knife, which I was very frightened by.  He didn't threaten me with it but rather just did tricks with it; one of which was to reach behind and in between my legs, throwing it up and then catching it in front of me.  He was constantly laughing and smiling, a very pleasant and kind man, but seemingly unaware of social norms.  He gave me a stress ball which I still have 3 years later.  At the time I was very scared, however retrospectively this experience made me realize that anyone is capable of being that manner of pleasant and kind person despite their circumstances.\n\tUnderstanding the circumstances of Doug and Jeff, the man from my experience, through a symbolic interactionist lens enables us to better understand why they might be considered outsiders by society\u2019s standards.  Symbolic interactionism states that an individual is able to choose their own behavior according to or despite the influences of society, and those societal influences are largely communicated by subtle \u201dsymbols\u201d.  Individuals struggling from certain mental disorders or other conditions may have a harder time discerning or deciphering these symbols and are therefore more likely to \u201dact of their own accord\u201d according to symbolic interactionism.  \n\t One thing that came to mind from the textbook was William Cockerham's seven phases of experiencing mental disorder; though the phases are not intended to be a road map or to be experienced in a specific order.  Beginning with alienation from place, Doug was considered by his teachers to be very pleasant in school, but when his symptoms hit that strain led to such outward effects as social alienation, certainly what could be described as troublesome emotions.  With regards to recognizing symptoms, he gains improved insight later on in his journey once he started seeing Julie at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, but was very resistant to acknowledging the existence of his condition early on in this journey; that isn't to say he never did prior to his work at Mercy but rather he truly accepted it at that stage which allowed for a very successful recovery.  Madness as a method of coping says one uses symptoms to cope with life circumstances or interacts with others with different perceptions of reality, the latter qualifier is certainly observed throughout the book such as the instance where Doug is sitting in the car and claims that there is a girl in the backseat, a recurring hallucination, and recounts having sex with her.  Regarding the definitive outburst there is a very clear instance of this towards the beginning of the book when Doug has been brought home and Wendy finds him very distressed, yelling at no one in the backyard.  For removal from place, when Doug is being targeted by the kids at Madden and can\u2019t go home he resolves to remove himself from the situation by self isolating until he feels ready to come back.  For the rendering of accounts, the closest symptomatic thing he does to an attempt to excuse, justify, or explain his symptoms is to say that the people he sees and voices he hears are in fact there.  The paradox of normalcy occurs throughout his journey; there are moments such as the \u201clasagna night\u201d after he came home from being missing for several weeks, or normalcy can also be found in how he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d and attempts to maintain a casual atmosphere.\n\tDoug\u2019s experiences, my own, and those of our families are demonstrative of such concepts as stigma, the seven phases of mental disorder, and the process of grief experienced by caregivers.  What is stigmatized, why it is so, and to what severity are all constantly shifting in a given community; this influences individuals in life-changing ways.  Similarly, people are capable of finding ways to adapt to current societal expectations and requirements regardless of such counter forces.  ",

        "text": "What stood out to me was the tension between love and helplessness. Douglass loved his son deeply, but he couldn\u2019t control the illness. He couldn\u2019t fx it. That helplessness is something many families face when mental illness enters the picture. Society often expects parents to have the answers, but the truth is, situations like this are confusing, overwhelming, and unpredictable. Reading this book also made me think about how mental illness is treated in society. Douglas felt like he had to lie about his children\u2019s struggles because of stigma. That stigma still exists today. People still keep mental health quiet out of fear of being judged. Families end up isolated, not because they want to be, but because they feel like no one will understand. The book also made me think about identity and loss. When Douglas explained feeling like his son had become a stranger, it struck me deeply. That kind of grief isn\u2019t often talked about. It's not losing someone physically, but emotionally. And it can last for years. Douglas\u2019s honesty in sharing these feelings made his story even more powerful to me.\nAs I read, I also thought about how strong families can be in the middle of pain. Douglas didn\u2019t always have the answers. He felt lost and ashamed at times. But he still showed up for his son. He learned, advocated, and kept hoping, even had to show tough love at times. That kind of strength isn\u2019t loud, it\u2019s quiet and steady, and it often goes unnoticed. This book also showed me how much support families need when facing mental illness. Douglas had to figure everything out by going to the library on his own. There wasn't a clear path or enough resources to guide him. While things have improved in some ways today, many families still experience that same lack of support. Mental health care often focuses on individuals, but families are a huge part of the story. They\u2019re the ones trying to hold everything together when things fall apart. By the end of A Boy Broken, I didn\u2019t just feel like I had read a book, I felt like I have been trusted with someone\u2019s real life. I walked through confusion, hope, heartbreak, love, and even tons and tons of important information. The story doesn\u2019t need dramatic language to be powerful. It\u2019s powerful because it\u2019s honest. \nOn a personal level, it made me think about my own family and how complicated it can be to love someone through something you don\u2019t fully understand. Even when the situations aren't the same, the emotions, fear, helplessness, frustration, love, are all universal. That\u2019s why this book matters. It doesn't just speak to families dealing with schizophrenia; it speaks to anyone who has ever loved someone they couldn't save. In the end, A Boy Broken is a story about love, lost, and resilience. It\u2019s about a father doing everything he can in a situation bigger than him. It\u2019s about a son whose life was shaped by illness but also moments of connection and hope. And it\u2019s about a family carrying the pain that most people never see. This story reminded me why it\u2019s so important to approach mental health with honesty and compassion. It\u2019s easy to talk about menta illness in terms of symptoms or statistics. But Douglas\u2019s story gives it a human face. It shows the daily reality: the denial, the fear, the grief, and the moments of hope. \nReflecting on this book has changed the way I think about mental health and family. It made me more aware of how stigma can isolate people, how love can hold on even at hard times, and how loss can be both exprected and devastating. It also made me respect the strength it takes to share a story like this. It\u2019s one thing to live it, another to let others in. I am grateful I got to read this story and learn from it. A boy Broken isn\u2019t just book, it\u2019s a personal testimony of a father\u2019s love, pain, and courage/. It left me with a deeper understanding of what it means to love someone through their struggles, and how even in loss, that love never disappears. This story reminded me how powerful things can be, even in the darkest and most painful moments of life. ",

        "text": "Mid-Term Reflection\nSOC 433\n\tThis was such a tragic and moving story. To follow along on your journey with Doug was an enlightening experience. Before this class, I would have never thought how many people mental disorder affects. I mostly just thought about it in an internal way; how it affects the person themselves. Now I know that the family has to step up in severe cases, providing support however they can. Every step in this story, when you found out Doug was hearing voices, to getting him care, to waiting for him to get better, to seeing him gain insight, backslide time and time again, but eventually end up in a good city, with friends and even a girlfriend was really inspiring. It must have been so scary knowing something detrimental could happen at any point, but still trusting he will do good for himself. Doug must have been a very strong willed person to learn coping skills and get his life together so soon after the diagnosis.\n\tReading about his premature death after all the things your family went through was devastating. It must have been exhausting not only to be his caregiver, but to lose that role in the blink of an eye. What\u2019s even worse is that this probably happens to so many people. Car accidents are far too common and take so many lives. This book really made me think about all the bad things that can happen to someone. Not only that, but how those events impact other people, especially with regards to mental health. Experiencing something like that reshapes how you see the world. You had no further interest in business, and just wanted to find meaning by telling your story. Melissa had Scott for support but ended up moving closer to her mother. The good thing was that at least you guys had a good bond for a few years after Doug\u2019s death. I know that death can either tear people apart or bring them closer. This seemed like one blessing in a river of sorrow. \nI really resonated with how you discussed being a caregiver to Doug. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how intensive a role of a caregiver is. My little sister is disabled. She is nonverbal, has limited mobility, and has a lot of health concerns. She has a number of medications to control her seizures, mood swings, and vitamins to keep her relatively healthy. She can\u2019t do things normal kids do. When we found out she was disabled, my mom jumped right in to all the doctors\u2019 appointments and diagnostics. It has been nine years since my sister was diagnosed with 13.31q deletion syndrome. My mom has been the primary caregiver the whole time and I\u2019ve seen it affect her in so many ways. Like you said in your book, she has faced the mental consequences of being a caregiver. She has less of a social life, and she has sacrificed her hobbies and career to take care of my sister. Because of this, she has been struggling with her anxiety disorder, self-confidence, and depression. However, she loves my sister and makes the most of it. After 10 years of caregiving for my sister, my mom is able to communicate with her nonverbally. Sometimes it even seems like they are reading each other\u2019s minds. My mom celebrates the little victories now, like when my sister eats a new food or has the energy to walk around.\nKnowing what I know, it is interesting to see how the caregiving relationship is for someone with a mental disorder. Being a caregiver to Doug is unlike my experience, where my mom and sister interact every day. A long distance caregiving relationship is very different. In both cases, you are making sure the person is taken care of. While my mom can physically look at my sister and keep her safe, you did not have that luxury. He wasn\u2019t a child with a disability, but a grown man with schizophrenia. I did not even know people could be caregivers for that. It had to have taken a lot of trust between the two of you to get to where you were in his last few months. \nAnother thing I resonated with was Melissa. I am the oldest child, followed by four disruptive siblings. Two of my younger brothers are impulsive and have anger issues. My youngest brother has ADHD and my little sister, as I said before, is severely disabled. I\u2019ve always been the \u201ceasy\u201d one. I like to follow rules, be nice to people, and get straight As. I also have a strong personality, like how you described Melissa. I will eventually be moving far away from my family as well, putting distance between my parents and I, as did Melissa. I have also struggled with depression and anxiety and felt invisible. It\u2019s interesting to see how being the \u201cglass child,\u201d or even the eldest girl, can affect people\u2019s personality and mental health in similar ways. I\u2019ve been comparing my experience with others for a long time now. It is definitely comforting to know that others experience similar things as me. \nIn the first few steps of yours and Doug\u2019s journey with schizophrenia, there was a lot of discovery involved. When he first admitted to you his hallucinations, it was shocking. The element of stigma came into play immediately there, when you said you were a little bit scared of him. This made me realize our society associates schizophrenia with danger and fear. I\u2019m not sure when I learnt this, but if I saw someone talking to no one on the street, I would walk faster. It is bad that in our modern society, we still have a long way to go with regards to understanding and tolerance. The insert you put about stigma was very helpful in understanding how transformative this experience was. When you realized Doug was hallucinating and possibly schizophrenic, you didn\u2019t really know what to do other than send him away. That does make the most sense initially. What do you tell friends, family, and neighbors? I would be scared of people acting weird around me or walking on eggshells. Stigma is so prevalent in our society.\nI thought this book offered really unique insight to schizophrenia. In the past, I\u2019ve only read or heard about mental disorder firsthand. I have watched videos and movies on schizophrenia in the past, but I enjoyed reading an outside view on someone with schizophrenia. You never really knew what he was thinking, but you got him help and stood by his side through it all. I was so curious about what he did when he left Madden, why he left Madden and whether or not the neighborhood boys were actually threatening him or not. It was also very interesting how you included the \u201cGrief\u201d section and compared each stage to what you went through. I didn\u2019t know that was possible for someone who was still alive. It made me think of my sister again, and I began to associate my own experiences with the stages of grief. I remember experiencing denial when my sister gained then lost around 25 words. She couldn\u2019t even speak sentences yet when her disability caught up with her. I did not accept that she was disabled for a very long time. It was about until she was five, and was now going off to elementary school and couldn\u2019t speak or play. She was developmentally still a baby. At this point I was in middle school, and the anger came in. I was so angry that I couldn\u2019t have one normal sister. I have 3 brothers and was so excited to play with her and grow up with her. I felt like I got that ripped away from me. Bargaining was when I decided to be a doctor so I could cure people like her. I had heard about stem cells and that was it, I decided to cure chromosomal disorders. Depression was when I couldn\u2019t even look at her. I still feel guilty about it. I love her to death, but it was just too hard to see her in her bed all the time. Finally, acceptance, which I believe I just reached this past summer. I started to help my mom with her medicine and caregiving, and I feel like I finally saw my sister for exactly who she was. I stopped wanting her to be normal after that. I\u2019ve reached the point where she would not be my sister if she didn\u2019t have her disability.\nI did not know what to expect when I read this book. It ended up taking me on so many unexpected twists and turns. It would get scary then uncomfortable then flat out difficult. From him first admitting his hallucinations (although not admitting that they were hallucinations) to him leaving his group home and going off the grid for three weeks. I think the \u201cTough Love\u201d and \u201cIn The Wind\u201d chapters had to be the most scary to experience. You have to approach this new dynamic so carefully, but also support Doug\u2019s growth as a person. Navigating that must have been tough. Then when he decided he wanted to go back to Pittsburgh, you had to respect his autonomy. This surely did not seem like the most stable decision but you both had to find compromise. \nMy favorite chapter was definitely \u201cMercy\u201d because everything was looking up. I could tell you felt it and he did as well. He finally found a good connection with a therapist, and it opened him up. He gained insight, found friends, and was being more social. After everything you guys had gone through it had to have felt like a win. On top of that, him getting to go to a wedding and see his family one last time was refreshing. The way you described him being the \u201chighlight\u201d of your day was adorable. I loved this book because I do not normally read biographical works. I usually stick to fiction, but this was a nice change in my routine. It was a very riveting book and I believe I got some lessons from it. One was to hug my siblings. The other is to give people more grace and acceptance. Our world could use more empathy. \n",

Engelman\nOctober 24, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTrends of family styles, models, and interpersonal functionality have vastly changed over the course of the past few decades. Women have joined the workforce at an increasing rate to attain social and economic gain, young adults have prioritized education and a career over marriage- which has contributed to higher rates of single-parent households-, and lesbian/gay couples are more common than ever before. In combination with the increased cost of living in recent years, these trends can be used to forecast how American families will likely function in the year 2035.\n\tThere are multiple factors contributing to the steady decline of first marriage rates amongst Americans in the past few decades (Brown et al., 2022). Young adults have been prioritizing a higher education and/or their career over marriage in their early 20s, societal expectations to marry early (or at all) have been less pressurized, and young adults have been waiting to marry until they feel financially stable (Trevino, 2022). The current decline of the economy, including an increase in the cost of living, creates an incentive for the lower class to put off marrying or not marrying at all (Furstenberg, 2015). A decrease in religious expectations to marry removes the sexual appeal towards marriage and in general removes pressure to marry for some Americans; this trend will continue as society progresses and decentralizes religion further. These factors can also contribute to a couples\u2019 decision whether or not to have children, biological or otherwise. Overall, the American birth rate has dropped a whopping 20% from 1980 to 2007 (Kearney et al., 2022); factors previously discussed, such as prioritizing higher education, are responsible. Marriage rates and birth rates have a symbiotic relationship in saying that when marriage becomes socially normalized later in life, many do not try to become pregnant until later in life.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that the average family in 2036 will consist of older parents who married later in life or decided to not marry at all; they most likely have one or two children, if any. \n\tThe decline in marriage until later in life combined with the trend of cohabitation rather than marriage are two factors that will contribute to the increase of blended families by 2035. On the other hand, marrying for true love rather than for financial benefit- which has traditionally been the case- has decreased divorce rates since the 1980s (Coontz, 2005). I believe the typical family in 2035 will overall be happier than the typical family from 2025 for several reasons; the upward trend of young adults not marrying until their late 20s on average (or not marrying at all) provides individuals with the opportunity to not be socially forced into early marriage for possibly financial reasons. When young adults view marriage as a social institution that comes after being financially stable and educated with a career, there is more opportunity for success (Coontz, 2005). It is not a secret that a happy home environment generally produces happy and well children compared to those from a socially dysfunctional one. \n\tSame-sex marriage has experienced an upwards trend since its legalization in 2015, and the number of same-sex households (married and unmarried) continue to rise. Although I think the \u201caverage\u201d, as in most common, relationship would be straight, it would not be surprising if some Americans in 2035 thought of a gay couple when asked to picture the average relationship. In regards to masculinity, the erosion of the belief that the more masculine appearing or acting partner is responsible for traditionally male roles and traits will continue. The Second Shift Change described by Hochschild in which women began being active members of the workforce while remaining responsible for caretaker tasks will evolve as we have already been seeing. Women may enter the workforce while men stay at home, take care of the children, and do household tasks. This motion and the stigma of males being the breadwinner are becoming more and more common as time goes on, and will continue to do so. With that being said, the typical family in 2035 will most likely have both partners of the relationship in the work force. Economically, we have experienced stagnant wages for decades while the cost of living continues to increase. This only provides more of an incentive for Americans to pursue a higher education, not marry, and not have kids; furthermore, Furstenberg (2015) proposes that unless American wages increase or our tax system is modified to better benefit workers of lower paying jobs, there is no incentive financially for the lower class to marry young (if at all). In a climate where lower-income families have lower rates of marriage in the present day, the typical family in 2035 may not involve marriage altogether, making blended families more common (Furstenberg, 2015).\n\tThe biological mother position will have slightly shifted and become more multifaceted. Given that there will be a greater population of same-sex households, blended households, and single mothers, the biological mother may devolve from its traditional traits, one of which being the primary caregiver. Because mothers will continue to be active participants in the workforce and stigma around employed women still being homemakers more so than the male, The rate of single mothers rising also means increased aid of community (family, friends) to raise children, making the family dynamic even less traditional than before; the projected growing disparity between cost of living and wages will also expand this concept. Given that there will be a greater population of gay couples that do not have a biological mother role and less couples will be having children, the biological mother will be less common and more diverse. However, social change does not occur overnight, so in ten years the average couple will have a biological mother. \n\tTo conclude, the trends we see in the past few decades such as a decline in marriage and higher rates of blended families will continue into the year 2035. Although the population of single parents have been increasing in recent years, the rising cost of living will increase cohabitation rates, whether that be with a significant other, family, or friends. Another result of this economic change is that the majority of families will be dual-income, meaning the mother is a part of the labor force as well. There would be more instances in which the mother works while the father becomes a homemaker if not for the projected economic shift raising the cost of living while keeping wages stagnant. Social movement and the overall stray from the traditional nuclear family, including its gender roles, will continue; the father of the average household will contribute to household tasks such as dishes and laundry as well as taking care of the children. More families who do not have biological mothers, such as same-sex couples, will be a part of the movement in which both parents contribute equally to family life while working; couples who adopt actively make an assumption that each person will care for the child and continue caring for the home equally, or at least what they perceive to be fair (Moore, 2008). The average family will be dual-income, unmarried until later in life (if at all), and have one or two kids; the trends we have seen in past decades will continue into the next one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nBrown, S.

Sandel investigates age-old queries of ethics, justice, and the duties we owe to each other.\u00a0 Sandel takes the reader on a whimsical tour of competing moral paradigms. Including utilitarianism, libertarianism, and Kantian duty to Aristotelian virtue, through the ten chapters.\u00a0 These theories are theoretical, but practical and relevant to human experience.\u00a0 As a first-generation college student, growing up and seeing others struggle, I am interested in how these ideas illuminate not just questions of law and public policy but also personal decisions in my own life.\u00a0 Sandel\u2019s reading really drives home the point that justice is not only a philosophical idea, but also material practice, influenced by freedom, fairness, and responsibility.\nSandel opens with the example of price gouging following a huge hurricane event, offering three different approaches to justice: maximizing welfare, respecting freedom, and promoting virtue.\u00a0 The struggle between advocates of the free market and those against it, shows us how crises bring to the forefront the concept of self-interest versus civic duty.\u00a0 Growing up, I often saw people economically exploited, like when landlords raised rents or employers reduced hours and workloads as the economy was failing.\u00a0 These everyday injustices reflected Sandel's argument: markets don't ensure fairness, especially where people are most desperate.\u00a0 This chapter speaks profoundly to me because it brings to the forefront of why I came to criminology and law: to better understand the rules and structures that protect people who are vulnerable, not just people with money or power.\nThe narrative of the marooned sailors who vanquished and devoured the cabin boy personifies utilitarian thought of sacrificing one for three.\u00a0 While utilitarianism values the outcomes with reference to the \"greatest good for the greatest number,\" it and efficiency can displace the worth of the dignity of individuals.\u00a0 As a first-gen student, I feel society sometimes sees other first-gen students and me with a utilitarian logic; institutions regularly value individuals based on statistics.\u00a0 Such as graduation rates, income levels, test scores rather than an individual\u2019s unique battles and resilience.\u00a0 Utilitarian thinking has merit in the public policy space; the utilitarianism logic often considers individuals as simply numbers.\u00a0 Sandel pushes us to consider whether efficiency is important enough or does justice mean something more?\nSandel makes his first foray into libertarianism, with a focus on individual rights and a limited role for government.\u00a0 Libertarian thinkers such as Robert Nozick even contend that redistributive tax policies are tantamount to \"forced labor.\"\u00a0 While I find great-to-strong admiration in the libertarian insistence on personal freedom.\u00a0 I tend to value my own independence, by sympathizing with the libertarian tendency to own my choices, my own life experience provides insight into the blind spot that libertarianism holds.\u00a0 Specifically, I would never have had the opportunity to think about pursuing post-secondary education if it weren't for financial aid, scholarships, and support from family and community members.\u00a0 Without the help from scholarships and financial aid, my studies could not be done.\u00a0 All forms of cash transfers or redistribution are in fact not theft, but rather the most basic forms of inspiration for me.\u00a0\nThe chapter's emphasis on markets, whether for paying soldiers or surrogates, begs the question of what money should and should not buy.\u00a0 I felt strongly connected to this discussion when Sandel asks whether the volunteer army is voluntary or if poverty conditions coercively pull people into military service.\u00a0 I grew up seeing friends enlist in the military because college did not seem to be an option.\u00a0 Their choice was less motivated by patriotism than by necessity and survival.\u00a0 This connects me back to why student loan debates, minimum wage debates, and education access debates are moral issues as the justice we seek requires conditions for having meaningful choices.\u00a0 Not merely free choice.\nKant redirects the discussion when he asserts that ethics relates to motives, not consequences.\u00a0 His claim that individuals must always be treated as an end and never as a means is no small task but is also an extraordinary challenge.\u00a0 As someone who is trying to go to law school, I also find Kant\u2019s view to be particularly striking.\u00a0 The legal system often vacillates between utilitarian efficiency which is cost-effectiveness and Kantian dignity making sure that each defendant\u2019s rights are honored.\u00a0 Personally, Kant's emphasis on intention makes me aware that my success in college is not really about earning grades or bulking up my resume for law school; it\u2019s about why I choose to pursue an education; for me, it\u2019s about the honor of doing so for the sake of my family and an opportunity to serve for justice for those who doesn\u2019t.\nJohn Rawls establishes the \"veil of ignorance,\" tasking us to think about how we would establish a society without the context of having a social position.\u00a0 His principles equal basic liberties and the difference principle feel fair and real to me.\u00a0 As a first-generation student, I know the sense of being weighed down, to know what it may feel like competing like you are in a race, while everyone else has socially-based head starts.\u00a0 I found that my peers have had it better getting into the best of the best schools, because they could afford it.\u00a0 Although my parents have helped and supported me, financially I could not be here without financial-aid or scholarships.\u00a0 Rawls legitimizes that feeling by stating inequality is only fair if it benefits those in an inferior position.\u00a0 That is why programs such as need-based scholarships are a good, real-world approximation of Rawlsian justice. Need-based scholarships do not provide charity, but pursue justice.\nSandel examines concepts of justice through the discussion around affirmative action, considering perspectives of fairness, merit and diversity.\u00a0 This debate strikes a personal chord with me, because I have witnessed privilege and disadvantage in admission processes.\u00a0 Some classmates had the advantage of a tutor, legacy, and financial support.\u00a0 I relied upon my persistence and community support.\u00a0 Affirmative action, in my mind, is not about disregarding merit but it is about broadening our understanding of merit.\u00a0 A student who has Systemic Barriers demonstrated resilience and potential that cannot be captured through test scores alone.\u00a0 In this case, justice understands context.\nIn Aristotle\u2019s virtue-based theory, the virtue of justice is understood as giving people what they are due, which entails understanding the telos, or the purpose of social roles and institutions.\u00a0 This chapter challenged me to consider what may be my telos as a student and future lawyer.\u00a0 Is my education exclusively for my personal achievement of moving ahead in my life; or does it have a collective telos of fulfilling my community?\u00a0 I have witnessed through my sorority experience how rituals and service projects develop character and virtue, leading me to recall that being part of a community means more than fulfilling self-interest.\u00a0 Aristotle's emphasis on the good life leads me to reflect on education and law not merely as mechanisms to earn an income, but as vehicles to serve justice itself.\nSandel focuses on moral obligations based on community, history, and consent.\u00a0 It raises in my mind the obligations I have to the family who sacrificed everything for me to go to college and to the community that created me.\u00a0 Being a first-gen college student isn't just an individual accomplishment; it is a community accomplishment.\u00a0 I am bearing the weight of my family's hopes, and I also feel a commitment to pay it back to my family or at least my community.\u00a0 Justice, then, is not a project of universal principles, but also the honoring of particular obligations.\nThe last chapter contends that justice cannot be morally neutral; it must attend to questions about the good life.\u00a0 Sandel questions the principle of governance neutrality and argues that societies debate virtues and values no matter what.\u00a0 As I reflect on my engagement in public life, this rings true to me.\u00a0 As a student ambassador at my community college and now as a member of Greek community life.\u00a0 I have witnessed the flourishing of communities when we talk significantly and openly about values, like fairness, honesty, and service.\u00a0 For me, justice and the good life mean a commitment to education that enhances the voices of those silenced by inequality.\nSandel's first ten chapters are more than a quick primer in moral philosophy but also a mirror in which one can see personal experience.\u00a0 Being a first-generation college student, I have found myself hovering at the chain of these theories.\u00a0 Hovering over utilitarian calculations of cost and benefit, libertarian visions of freedom.\u00a0 Kantian respect for dignity, Rawlsian demands of fairness, Aristotelian invitations to virtue, and communal responsibilities of solidarity.\u00a0 Justice, as Sandel illustrates, is not a remote problem to be solved but a question to ask about the kind of society we want to build and the kind of people we want to be.\u00a0 My course through college is not so much one of individual improvement but one of taking that question into my own life.\u00a0 Striving for a vision of justice that honors both freedom and community, rights and responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\nSandel, M.

        "text": "\tAs the reading deepens and the story goes on, the Engelman family begins to come to an understanding of their son\u2019s illness. They can begin to learn what is real and what is hallucinations in his mind. As Dr. Engelman goes to more and more doctor's visits; he is able to gain a deeper connection to what his son is experiencing. He learns more about the diagnosis everyday alongside Doug and it begins to re-strengthen their relationship again. But this isn't to say the relationship was filled with love and understanding. There was often tension and confusion and frustration that would arise from all corners of the household. Family sometimes serves as a strength and sometimes serves as a tension holder. As his illness varies, they all vary. \n\tThe moments of lightness and compassion are what make this story such a true tale of the lives all lived. Dr. Engelman is bluntly honest about his feelings, and his confusions and his frustrations could very easily seem as if they took over his time with Doug after diagnosis, but the moments of understanding and love stick out so beautifully. Love prevails through all emotions, making the small moments of true happiness and love shine through the pain and suffering of this family. As the reader bounces back and forth between raw emotions and hopeful expectations, the book entails a true encapsulation of what this experience could look like in so many other lives.\n\tIn the end of Engelman\u2019s heart aching story of love and sorrow, the worst tragedy to lay upon this family was the fatal car accident stealing their precious son's life. A life taken too quickly. After all of the emotions his family faced day in and day out, nobody could have warned them of the pain they were about to encounter. Loss is a painfully encapsulating debilitating emotion. For a father; unimaginable. The loss of a loved one is an emotion most people know too well and it is something that will never, for the rest of their lives, go unfelt. Looking at your faith and your perception of the world is a trap most people find themselves stuck in for months and sometimes years at a time after this life altering event. Death is an emotion humans were not wired to deal with all too easily. Whether it comes to stay in the moment or it comes back later, it never leaves. \n\tMany people, when they find themselves living with the grievance of a loved one, are disabled in the real world until they can formally accept what is happening. After enduring the relationship and diagnosis of Doug\u2019s death was not any different than the emotion of helplessness. Left to question all of the actions he's made in his life and all of the different ways he and his son interacted and loved one another. The cyclical emotion of loss, helplessness and confusion continued into his personal life, but because of this he became a more thoughtful person. Whether the dwelling of the loss or the dwelling on actions before death were the emotions at hand. Dr. Engelman was able to look back on his and the life of his sons with a different perspective. He was able to understand better the effects his actions caused Doug and the effects that his life had on his own. Gaining better insight day after day was one of the things that allowed Engelman to gain some peace and clarity after his son's passing. Leaning on his faith and learning that not all events have to happen for a reason is one of the strongest senses of clarity he was able to gain in the toughest time in his life.\n\tThe reader is able to gain a better perspective on what it is like to be in a family with a troubling diagnosis of a loved one. We are sent through a rigorous combination of emotions that shows us the raw and real experiences of a family. This story allows the readers to make connections to their own lives and for some it may be a helpful outlet. Learning that other people may be going through a similar experience can help in so many ways. \nI was able to resonate with this story and was blessed enough with this reading to be able to understand diagnosis in my life better. My grandmother on my moms side recently went through a diagnosis with bipolar disorder. Throughout our lives there has always been an overarching tension between my grandmother and this side of the family. I was always told as a kid that my mom just didn\u2019t have a great relationship with her mom and I started to see more and more of that the older I grew older. Over the past couple weeks my mom grew very anxious of the unresponsiveness of my grandmother. She called for a wellness check and shortly after she was admitted to a mental institution in Georgia. She was very quickly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was given strict medication. After reading A Boy Broken, I was able to feel a generous amount of alleviation to the anger I held toward my grandmother. I realized that all of the emotions I held were because I didn't understand what was going on, it frustrated me that I didn\u2019t know and continued the cycle. I feel grateful for the moments of generosity I had for her actions towards my mother and was able to feel safe in knowing that those moments shined through just as much as Dr. Engelman's actions of light and breakthrough did. Although I wasn\u2019t able to be as knowledgeable as Engelman during most of the time, It made me feel safer to know that all of my emotions weren\u2019t something only I experienced. \nOverall, this novel showed great discomfort and vulnerability of a father and his journey with his son through a debilitating diagnosis. Throughout the novel the reader is able to gain better insight on what it would be like to experience a seemingly broken family to an outsider. But when taking a deeper look, we are able to realize that all people experience the same emotions and not one of them can be held in greater disdain than another. A heartbreaking story that shows raw human emotions allows people to see that there is more to a person than a diagnosis. ",

        "text": "SOC 250-001\nIssues in Social Justice \nReflection #1 \nJustice: What's The Right Thing To Do?\n\tThroughout this reading, we have visited a plethora of topics, discussed a multitude of social, moral, and other issues, and compared every avenue of approach utilizing our own lived experiences and facts. Michael Sandel creates passages of information based on facts, lived experiences, hypotheses, theologies, and a vast array of other sources of contribution. As a Professor at Harvard, Sandel provides us with a variety of moral and social dilemmas throughout this book. As a class, we have dived deep into his realm and spent extensive time discussing and presenting his ideas. We have taken the time to draft our own interpretations and draw conclusions to the best of our ability. A key feature throughout this reading is to not only recall the amount of history that has been written about, but also how it has transcended into the very present-day society we live in. \n\tAs we know, social justice comprises two interconnected categories, personal and political aspects. Sandel provides an intimate exploration of every perspective across all categories in Justice. In the beginning chapters, Sandel discusses the early stages of moral reparations that will cascade in keeping with the theme throughout the entire book. He compares and contrasts different beliefs, principles, and their outcomes. Most of the philosophical and theological questions posed offered no true, definitive response. In part, this is due to the nature of such inquiries, as there are so many details and contexts contributing to each one. While exploring these topics in class discussions, student presentations, discussion posts on Canvas, and throughout my own reading, I have drawn many conclusions and still have many questions to be discussed and elaborated on further. \n\tReferring back to the reading regarding Marcus Luttrell and the historic event of the Afghan goat herders, his team, and the mountainside in Afghanistan. They stumbled upon each other, along with a 14-year-old boy. Luttrell and his team cast a vote on whether or not to let them go or kill them, and he cast the deciding vote to release them. They did not have a rope to tie them up. The risks of releasing them were all known - they could easily report back to the Taliban and associates of Osama Bin Laden right down the mountainside. This would 100% compromise their position, and they would likely be overrun by insurgents within the hour and killed. Unfortunately, that was exactly what occurred, and all of Luttrell's teammates were killed; he was the only one to survive. He admits that his vote was mostly based on his Christian faith, and that is why he voted against killing them. However, he quickly regretted his decision as his teammates were all killed in action shortly after the goat herders were released, and notified the Taliban of the SEAL's position. In addition, the insurgents also shot down a helicopter that was aiming to rescue the SEALs who were pinned down, adding an additional 16 casualties. Overall, not killing the three goat herders cost 19 American lives, nearly 20 as Luttrell barely survived. We discussed this in class, and the perspective I provided as a United States Army veteran myself was insightful to the real moral dilemmas service members face every day. Some opinions were shared in class once Dr. Engelman asked us, \"Would you have killed them or let them go?\" I believe everyone in class said they would have released the goat herders, especially sympathizing with the fact that they had a 14-year-old boy with them. I offered the opinion that I would have killed them had I been in Luttrell's position. I provided substantial information regarding this decision and a perspective that no one else in the class has lived. While I understand the impacts of this decision, and being that Luttrell himself faced a moral dilemma in this situation that affected him so greatly, he couldn't execute them, this is still a heavily circumstantial issue. There is a concept in the military called \"violence of action.\" You are relentlessly in pursuit of making a decision within the least amount of time possible. This is necessary in order to mitigate loss of life. Unfortunately, in response to the point of my classmate, children were often used by insurgents for a variety of attacks and casualties on American troops while in combat in Afghanistan. There is also regard for your training, especially as a prestigious Navy SEAL such as Luttrell. Speaking on this issue is definitely no easy feat, as is in keeping with most of the topics within this book. However, it is imperative to understand where your degree of responsibility lies in situations such as this. \n\tAnother topic of Sandel's book that was frequently visited throughout our classroom presentations and discussions is that of military service being a civic obligation, where it lies on the scale of virtue, patriotism, and moral duties. Above all, the vast majority of our conversations related back to accountability in some way, whether it was collectively or as an individual. Dr. Engelman promotes us to think in ways that acknowledge our individual responsibility and understand and interpret how it transcends into society. Civic virtues and obligations are two wings that contribute not only to military service, but also to our conversation of patriotism. As we elaborated on in class and discussed during our presentation, patriotism is another aspect that Sandel incorporates that is difficult to navigate. The relation to our moral compass and the battle between the grounds of one's own character contribute extensively to how we interpret the world, but also how we show up in it. If we do not believe we are obligated to serve others, the likely outcome of that would be a thought process consistent with inaction and beliefs consistent with not viewing military service as a civic obligation. This concept also applies to other areas in society, as we discussed in the book regarding our involvement, or inaction, in saving someone else's life, or even just having the courtesy to help someone across the road. This is an interesting topic that Sandel visits and compares throughout the book. It is most relevant to the practices of libertarianism in the sense of the prevalence of one's own rights. What particularly stood out to me was the fact that so much of what he elaborated on applies to our present-day society. \n\tAs we continued to dive deeper into the philosophical meanings behind what is honorable, virtuous, and noble, we see a common theme in the differences of opinions and adopted practices. When this topic arose while discussing the 'learning by doing' portion of another team's presentation during class, it sparked more interest in accountability. They asked the discussion question, \"Do you think that practicing good behavior eventually leads someone to feel virtuous emotions (like gratitude/justice) genuinely?\" The responses to this question were intriguing and led me to speak on this topic. In particular, with regard to character, virtues, and one's moral compass, it makes sense that a person is either of good behavior naturally or they aren't. What I mean by that is, someone who is practicing good behavior in order to feel virtuous would do it naturally, as it is a core component of who they are as a person. It is not necessarily something that you would 'learn' or 'exercise.' The same concept applies to selflessness in the conversation regarding service and civic obligation, as previously mentioned. While one student explained his positive notions regarding selflessness in society, I politely disagreed. The world can be a very cruel place, and with spending any amount of time in regular society, you can witness that firsthand. We also see it on social media every day. I argued, via my own personal and professional experiences, that people are more selfish today than selfless. The art of understanding and respecting humanity has been lost, and in this current era, people are only worried about themselves and are less worried about anyone else. Decisions are based on emotion versus logic, science, facts, etc. This practice further deepens the divide we all see and feel every day in 2025. As I stated in class, people are going to pursue the easy wrong over the hard right by nature. This is not to excuse their behavior, however, but to acknowledge the fact that people in society do not possess the same amount of intrinsic desire to be of good moral character without an external emotional influence pushing them to that decision. The example I gave was the social media trend where people do things for those who cannot afford to, but the entire point of it is that they record it and put it on social media. While I am not saying it is wrong to celebrate someone doing a good deed, we are living in a society that only cares about the views, likes, and how they are able to further monetize something, instead of just being a good person and doing the right thing because it comes from the heart of who they truly are.\n\tThe viewpoints provided in this book have been nothing less than interesting, intriguing, and insightful. We have discussed and interpreted different historical philosophers, public figures, and others of the like. This has been a pivotal movement in bringing our class together and fostering a safe and healthy open platform for us to discuss our differences in opinions and experiences. I aim to continue doing so with the goal of further educating myself and also learning from Dr. Engelman and my classmates. ",

        "text": "Soc-250-001\n16 September 2025\nJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\nIn Michael J. Sandel's book titled Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? Sandel invites the reader to consider a multitude of different philosophical approaches through different philosophers. Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard lecturer, is incredibly well sought after due to his lectures being in high demand because he is so well informed on the topics he discusses. His book, Justice, was on the New York Times Bestseller list for its thought provoking and hard-hitting topics. Those topics span from Immanuel Kant to Aristotle and focus on things such as moral standings, libertarianism, utilitarianism, and more. In Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do, Sandel presents the reader with many different perspectives on human life and the value of it.\nImmanuel Kant is one of the first philosophers that Sandel mentions. Kant was born in 1724 and passed away in 1804. He was born in Prussia to a Protestant family that focused on doing good works for the church and religion. Kant was an academically inclined individual who tended to look for ways to continue his learning. Kant\u2019s first job was as an unpaid lecturer whose salary came from the number of people he taught. After a few years of working for the university, he became a well-known lecturer and was a highly regarded individual. His lectures were focused on topics such as geography, anthropology, law, and logic. During his time teaching, Kant began writing philosophical works to explain his beliefs to the masses. One notable work is his book titled Groundwork.\nIn Groundwork, Kant begs the question of what is truly of moral worth. Kant states, in his categorical imperative, that humans should \u201cact only on that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\u201d (pg. 120) When Kant mentions a \u201cmaxim\u201d he is regarding the rule or principle of an action. In short, Kant believes that we should act only as we would wish for things to become a universal truth. In my personal life, I have told countless lies to my loved ones that have ranged from \u201cI never said that\u201d to \u201cI don\u2019t know who did that.\u201d If I apply Kant\u2019s philosophy to my personal life, I am not acting according to his maxim because I would hate for all my friends and family to lie to me all the time. A universal law of lies would create distrust between myself and the people I hold closest to me. That would not be considered justice. \nAnother example of this philosophical approach in my personal life would be watching people pick flowers from a public park. I went to New York City this summer and witnessed multiple people in Central Park pick flowers off a bush. If everyone in the world acted in that way, would it be morally right? No, because the slope of one person taking a flower off the bush to everyone taking flowers off the bush would leave all the flower bushes in New York City barren. Humans would not gain anything from having empty flower bushes, so the action of picking a flower is not morally right in Kant\u2019s view. \nImmanuel Kant is also known for his views that tend to overlap with libertarianism. Specifically, the right to self-governance. He believes that we, as individuals, have the right to do whatever we want as long as we do not harm others. This thought process is juxtaposed by the utilitarian idea that the people should always do what is the best for the group rather than the individuals themselves. A modern example of these opposing ideas would be taxing. Libertarians would claim that we shouldn\u2019t tax the rich because they earned that money and nobody has the right to redistribute what they earned. However, utilitarians would say we should tax the rich because the people with less money need the money more. Their stance would be that it would help with the overall happiness of the group if the majority, the poor, got paid more. \nI had learned about libertarians and utilitarians in my history courses at high school but never thought this deeply about them before. Sandel poses many good points of view on both sides, and I believe that I fall closer to the libertarian view. I think everyone has a right to self-governance and the right to live life as themselves. Thinking back on the thought experiment about the lonely kid under the city that Sandel talks about in his book, I find that to be wrong. No matter how happy the upper city is, that kid deserves the right to be happy as well. That is an idea that would oppose utilitarians because I would be voting against the happiness of the majority for the freedom of the little boy. Although I am more libertarian, I do believe in taxing the rich. \nFurther into the book, Sandel begins a chapter on John Rawls. Rawls was an American philosopher who was born in 1921 and died in 2002. During his time alive, he advocated for the idea that justice is not based on what is morally right, like Kant, but rather \u201cwhat principals we would agree to in an initial situation of equality.\u201d (pg. 140) Rawls created a thought experiment titled the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d which means that people do not know their social status, their genders, or their education and from there, they create an unbiased foundation of justice. Sandel explains it as, \u201cSince no one would have a superior bargaining position, the principles we would agree to would be just.\u201d \nIn the thought experiment, Rawls creates the idea of an \u201coriginal position of equality\u201d where \u201cRawls invites us to ask what principals we- as rational, self-interested persons- would choose if we found ourselves in that position.\u201d (pg.141) When I allowed myself to sit with this experiment for the first time, I was uncomfortable. I have empathy for everyone, but I realized I don\u2019t spend much time thinking about those less fortunate than me on a daily basis. While I was thinking about if I was in an original position of equality I came up with some points that I would value for basic human justice. My list was filled with things like free healthcare (at the very least, affordable healthcare), access to education, access to healthy foods and clean water, and a safe place to live. Through Rawls thought experiment, anyone can put themselves in the shoes of another person and realize that some things are just inaccessible for the less fortunate. \nLooking at my life from the perspective of the veil of ignorance has made me feel a lot of privilege for my way of life. I have access to things such as insurance, safety, healthy foods, livable wage, a fun job, and good friends. A lot of thought experiments in Sandel\u2019s book lead to feelings of being uncomfortable because they push the reader to think about people less fortunate than themselves. The examples of the kid under the city and the veil of ignorance are just two of the ones I wanted to explore in this reflection. \nSandel also mentions Aristotle near the end of the book and mentions Aristotle's idea of \u201cTelos\u201d, meaning purpose or end. Aristotle believes that everything in nature has a purpose or an end, for example: a watch has the purpose of telling time. Aristotle's view of justice is based around the idea of giving people what they deserve based on their actions. Digging deeper into the watch example, a person facing justice would be the one wearing the watch or the one reading the watch because the person wearing the watch has the purpose of telling time. Looking into Aristotle's idea and adding it to my own narrative, I immediately think about my purpose or \u201ctelos\u201d in Student Government. The purpose of student government is to represent the student body of UNCW. If we represent the student body, then we oversee advocating for the students and making decisions for our peers based on what we know. From that perspective, the purpose of a student government member is to be the best representative of the student body they can be.\nStudent Government meets every week on Tuesdays. Those meetings can span from thirty minutes to two hours and thirty minutes. Last year, during my freshman year, we had a meeting discussing the tuition increases for out-of-state students. This discussion went on for hours as senators debated on whether an increase was a viable option. On one hand, the increase would mean more money for the university to expand as well as keeping up with other UNC campuses. On the other hand, the out of state students may be less likely to apply to UNCW. When it came to voting, I felt it was my duty to vote for increasing tuition due to the fact it would better the campus as a whole, granted that money is allocated properly to all students. My telos, as a student government member, was to serve the student body to the best of my ability that night. \n \tAfter finishing the book, there were a lot of points I was left to reflect regarding what justice means to me. Reflecting on Kant, Rawls, and Aristotle has left me with a clearer picture of philosophy and of what I believe is right. There truly is no right way to think of justice but there are new ideas about being fair. All three philosophers have great philosophies about justice and Sandel leaves it up to the reader to decide on which one they agree with the most. I personally feel that Rawls has the fairest idea of justice with the veil of ignorance. His idea of being ignorant of a person's path in life has really stuck out to me. \nMoving forward I plan on being more empathetic to those who are less fortunate than myself. Rawls thought experiments have really changed the way I see things, especially situations overseas and out of the country. I was aware of the situations people were going through overseas, but I was ignorant of how truly terrible it can be as an everyday living situation. Even expanding past Rawls, before this class I was ignorant of how much effect a New York City flower or lying could have on a universe of truth. Sandel's book Justice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do? Has challenged me to expand my horizons of thought and has encouraged me to think more outside the box than usual. This book and the ideas posed have been meaningful and transcendent and taken together, all three philosophers will impact the way I see justice. Justice is a personal and a communal effort that more people need to be aware of. ",

        "text": "The Future of Families\nThis generation is all together skipping that or waiting a longer period because they want to be sure of the decision, and the social expectations have lightened up as far as getting married, starting a family, and living happily ever after. I think that this will continue as a part of the continuing social progression, and legislation will be forced to catch up with the majority's sentiment. I think that divorce laws will loosen up in things like No-Fault divorce, and the amount of time that you need to be \u201cseparated\u201d before being able to officially file for divorce.\nTo support yourself, and potentially a family in this economy, it would be ideal for both partners to have full-time jobs. I see this continuing, as everything is continuing to get more expensive. The economy ebbs and flows, but right now and for the foreseeable future, inflation is only going to get worse. With both parents working, to be able to afford daily basics, there is no one in the house that is left to watch the children at home. Some families must choose between scraping by because one parent (usually the mother) must stay home or scraping by because childcare costs so much. I think with increased accessibility to teleworking, this will be less of a problem as far as childcare is concerned. \nEven with companies that allow teleworking, there is still some period where employees must physically be in the office. If there is no option for teleworking for some reason, then we are back to square one, with no one to watch the kids. There is the option of a childcare facility, but the rates for those places can be an extra financial burden on top of other general living expenses. The average range of childcare facility costs in the United States is $400-$1,500 a month. Families who can afford childcare are considered luxurious, and almost unattainable. \nIn recent years, there has been a shift in social ideas about single parenthood. There will always be a racial and gender factor that will slightly change these ideas, but people are starting to see that single parenthood isn\u2019t always negative. In 2018, a study found that one third of single parents are Black, and 71% of single parents are mothers (Livingston, 2018). Even though mothers take up a lot of real estate in single parenthood, fathers are becoming more prevalent in this group too, due to the shifting ideas that it is okay for a father to be a nurturing and caretaking parent. The setting of single parenthood is also a big part of this trend; some single parents are in multigenerational homes; others are single by choice. The \u201cby-choice\u201d situation was seen to emerge in the 1980s, and I predict that this trend will continue through 2035. This generation is hyper fixated on being as independent as possible, because we all have trust issues and horrible relationship trauma. We also have parents who had messy divorces, or stepfamilies that cause drama. I even have a close friend that for a while, he dreamed of being a single father and traveling the world with his future kid. This generation's ability to romanticize lifestyles that aren\u2019t as common or as lucrative will be a determining factor for the increase in single parenthood.\nFurther on non-traditional domestic arrangements, I feel blended families will be a large increase within the next 10 years. If about 50% of marriages end in divorce, then 50% of people have the decision to either remarry, stay single, or possibly cohabitate with a new long-term partner. A blended family is defined as a family where one or both parents have kids from a previous marriage, get together in a long-term relationship. These parents can also decide to have their own children or adopt in this new arrangement. I think that there will be a lot more instances of cohabitation instead of remarriage. This generation is grossly untrusting as it is, if individuals take the leap to get married and it does not work out, there will be less people who sign up to repeat the process.\nA lot of people are also finding out how truthful the phrase \u201cIt takes a village\u201d can be. I think with the state of the economy, we will see a lot more kinship systems. Some people in these systems other than the parents may be providing financially for the child or children, but I think mostly these systems will be used to reduce financial strain on the biological parents. When you have a tight-knit system of people that you trust with your child, you won\u2019t need childcare. If the people in these networks are willing to watch these children for an extended period, or in consecutive days, this allows the parents more time to work, which leads to the parents being able to save up more money for future experiences with their families.\nIf LGBTQ+ couples will still have the right to be married and have children in the next 10 years, I think that we will see more openly lesbian and gay families. They will be adopting children, as that is an option at the forefront of their minds, because biological kids aren\u2019t the typical route unless someone has kids from a previous marriage. I\u2019m not sure if \u201cincrease\u201d is the right word, I just think that more families will be open about this arrangement they have. If legislation passes that removes this right, I think we will start to hear about it less as time goes on, but there will still be a large chunk of the population who have lesbian, gay, or gender-nonconforming parents. There will still be children being adopted by LGBTQ+ families, but there will be a bit of fabrication on the documents. Things like lavender marriages will be what is presented to the outside, but the people parenting the child will be a part of the community.\nOverall, I think that we will have a hard time strictly defining \u201cfamily\u201d in the next 10 years, and that is not a problem. We will continue to move away from the heteronormative, white \u201cpicture perfect\u201d family that was only viable in the 1950s because of women\u2019s lack of rights and freedom to be an independent person and their expectation to be baby incubators who also cook and clean at home and aren\u2019t expected to be anything except for content with their lives. Not everyone and everything is meant to be the same, and the push for individuality without fear of social consequences has been more prominent over the last 10 years has done wonders, and I can only assume that it will continue to be that way in the next 10 years, assuming we still have the right to.\n\nReferences\nAhmed, F.

        "text": "SOC 250-001\n19 September 2025\n\nWhat is Justice?\nMichael Sandel\u2019s \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do\u201d is not only a text looking at philosophical ideas but it also acts as a conversation to create dialogue from the reader. The experience of reading this text resembled a classroom discussion instead of studying political theory because Sandel leads readers to confront difficult moral dilemmas.\nWhen I first picked up Sandel\u2019s book, I expected a discussion of right and wrong. Sandel bases his investigation on actual life situations which include emergency price hikes during disasters and military draft requirements and marriage rights for same-sex couples. These examples demonstrate that justice exists as an actual life experience which people experience during their regular activities. For me, this immediately shifted how I thought about ethics. The concept of justice operated as a real political principle which people used to discuss during their news debates and everyday dialogues. \nSandel starts by discussing utilitarianism which Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill developed as a theory that justice should create the most happiness for the largest number of people. The basic principles of utilitarianism drew me in because this philosophy evaluates decisions through only how much happiness the decision will bring, which was interesting for me to explore since the philosophy seems pretty simple and fairly democratic but when you put yourself in these positions it\u2019s hard to say if you would follow through with it.\nThe examples Sandel presented in his argument really made me think critically about what I would do. The author presents the runaway trolley scenario to determine if killing one person would be ethical to save the lives of five others. The utilitarian approach supports this decision yet I couldn\u2019t help but to think about what if the one person was a partner or family member, (or even me!) and the five others were strangers. Would I still approach the scenario with the utilitarian ideal? I doubt that I would let me or people close to me die and let 5 strangers live. Even though the five strangers most likely have people close to them that share the same feelings I have for people close to me. This example really demonstrated to me that I value human dignity and moral limits more than achieving the best possible results. I now think about scenarios like these all the time. For example, what if there WERE active shooters on campus and I saw a friend running for his life towards my car that I would be driving, but at the same time there is a group of 5 others further away. And somehow I wouldn\u2019t be able to save the five strangers AND my friend. What would I do? It's hard to say, maybe I would attempt to save all and fail to save any. It is a hard thing to grapple with but I thought that example was interesting.\nSandel moves from utilitarianism to libertarianism which focuses on individual rights together with free markets and limited government intervention. The protection of free market exchanges and personal property rights serves as the foundation for justice according to Robert Nozick. I respect the libertarian commitment to individual liberty as a core principle. I think it's important to not look at yourself and others as \u201ctools\u201d to get somewhere as a group. Of course there are exceptions but generally speaking it feels more moral to respect each other's liberty.\nSandel presents examples which demonstrate how libertarian principles produce unacceptable results. The practice of selling kidneys for financial survival raises doubts about transactional fairness according to the author. The text showed me that my dedication to freedom exists in the same way as my dedication to equality. The social and economic environment determines our choices according to my perspective on extreme libertarianism. Justice demands that people understand the current social imbalances which exist in society. \nPerhaps the most difficult but rewarding part of Sandel\u2019s book is his discussion of Immanuel Kant\u2019s philosophy. Kant rejects utilitarianism because he believes in the importance of duty and autonomy and treating people as ends in themselves. The initial aspect of Kant's writing style that caught my attention was his use of abstract terms which was a challenge to understand. Sandel used Kant\u2019s philosophy to explain dignity which helped me grasp its significance. \nKant would oppose lying to save a life because it uses the deceived person as a tool. My initial impression was that this approach went too far. Kant explained his position through demonstrating that justice requires permanent rules which should not be altered by any situation. I myself do not follow these permanent rules really at all in my life. I mean, when you really think about it, someone who follows the laws would be kind of an asshole to be around or at least I think so. Sometimes it is good to not tell it straight up and to put a subject in a different light so it is easy for the person to process. Nevertheless, Kant\u2019s view, while strict, pushes me to take responsibility for honesty and integrity more seriously. \nThe concept of \"justice of purpose\" which Sandel describes as Aristotle's perspective drew my interest the most. Aristotle argues that justice is about giving people what they deserve, based on the purpose of a practice or institution. For example, who should get the best flute?Aristotle says the best flute should go to the best flute player, because the purpose of a flute is to make beautiful music. \nThis idea provided me with a fresh look about how people discuss things like politics. Groups disagree because they have different views about what institutions should achieve as Sandel explains. In my experience, human beings create disagreements about justice because they hold different perspectives about what makes life significant. This knowledge has allowed me to become more patient and have more humility during debates because it demonstrates that people will not understand each other unless they first define their terms. \nSandel presents an interesting part in the book which explores what money should buy and what it should not. The author shows how markets now penetrate domains which used to fall under moral and civic rules by giving money to children for reading and by selling immigration slots. While markets are efficient, Sandel warns that they can corrupt the values at stake. \nThis resonated deeply with me. The way Sandel presented his argument forced me to think about whether civic goods should receive the same treatment as commercial products. The value of friendship, civic duty and education disappears when they become subject to commercialization according to my personal perspective. Sandel assisted me in understanding my discomfort about market expansion into all areas of life because it transforms both our acquired goods and our personal identity. \nSandel establishes his preferred approach to justice by focusing on the common good in his final section. Sandel stands apart from libertarians who focus on freedom and utilitarians who focus on results because he places primary importance on civic values and ethical choices. He believes we need to explore the moral and religious elements which establish the basis of justice. \nThe final part of the book had the most impact on me. The current era of political division makes people want to embrace non-partisan principles which stay away from all moral conflicts. Sandel believes authentic democratic practice demands citizens to join public discussions about their preferred social structure. I agree. I have a fear of political debates yet I understand that staying away from them leads to increased social separation between individuals. Through Sandel I learned to view disagreements as essential because they help us understand our core values and make us listen to different perspectives. \nI thought I would also talk about these three essential lessons from the book that will remain with me after reading the book. \nFirstly, justice exists in real-world application rather than theoretical concepts. The trolley problem and military service and same-sex marriage present more than abstract dilemmas because they show how philosophical ideas affect both state policies and personal decisions. \nSecondly, freedom and equality need to exist in a state of equilibrium. The absence of concern for inequality in libertarian freedom creates an unjust system while utilitarian equality without dignity consideration results in dehumanizing effects. To find the right answers you have to have the right balance.\nAnd Finally, the common good needs dialogue to operate effectively. Human beings will always disagree about moral issues, but we have the power to handle these disagreements through respectful dialogue. Things like political violence which we have seen recently only oppress people and cause harm to our system of democracy. \nThe book does not contain straightforward solutions. This book was refreshing from most of my books that I get for my classes. Rather than stating different views and arguing for which one is the most effective, this book presents different moral traditions which enable readers to evaluate their personal ethical values. For me, it was a journey of questioning assumptions, confronting stereotypes, and appreciating the complexity of justice. The book provides its most valuable contribution by allowing readers to improve their involvement in ongoing discussions rather than providing opinions to existing debates. The world today is controlled by fast-paced eye-catching statements, yet Sandel shows us that justice needs patience and humility and most importantly requires dialogue even when it is uncomfortable. \n",

        "text": "SOC-433-001 Sociology of Mental Disorders\n17 October 2025\nReflection on A Boy Broken\n\tRight from the off, the bit about visiting Uncle Harry in the mental hospital made me remember when I visited my grandmother at the assisted living facility where she spent her last years. At this point she had dementia, and when we visited her it was a holiday (I can\u2019t remember which one,) but she thought it was a different one. My mom and my aunt made sure my sister\u2019s and my exposure to her was limited, so we wouldn\u2019t see her decline. As time went on, my aunt kept visiting her, but at the end, my grandmother couldn\u2019t recognize her. \n\tIn a similar vein, my grandmother had psychotic breaks when she stopped taking her bipolar medication, and at one point tried to kill her dog because \u201cthe angels told her to do it.\u201d That episode was what led to my aunt taking the dog away from her for his own safety, and I can only imagine how terrifying it is to witness a psychotic break firsthand. \n\tThe first paragraph of Chapter 2 is one that I understand better than I would have liked. My mother has never hidden from me the struggles of her childhood and life when my grandmother was in decline. She has told me about the times when she was punished for things that didn\u2019t make sense to her, and when my grandmother did things that were harmful to herself, others, and things of value, sentimental or financial. My mom remembers how during one particular psychotic break, my grandmother put a cabinet with family photos out on her porch for the entire winter. Every photo in there got destroyed. My mom and my aunt tried their best to keep my grandmother safe and comfortable in her later years, and I was kept out of the loop because I was 7 or 8 at the time, too young to truly appreciate their struggle. It was only when I was in high school that my mom told me more about everything regarding her mother.\n\tThe part about social reaction to conditions and behavior of mental illness being what makes the illness stigmatized makes a lot of sense from a sociological perspective. As I\u2019ve said before in class, humans love an other. Whether it be by physical traits or mental traits, we love categorizing things around us. It may have something to do with subconscious evolutionary traits that served to keep us safe from predators or unknown dangers, but in the context of mental disorders, it is the unknown of the individual that scares us. Even when we see someone on the sidewalk talking to themselves, we don\u2019t know if they are just talking to themselves or if they are going to act on a thought that could bring harm to others or themselves. That is another thing about humans: we fear the unknown. As was pointed out in the book, society likes its routines and acceptable behaviors. To act outside of those norms is unacceptable and therefore deserving of punishment, be it actively or passively. To borrow a term I first heard from the autism community, people with mental disorders from a young age learn to \u201cmask\u201d in order to limit, or hopefully avoid, that stigma surrounding mental disorders, the goal being to fit in enough to avoid bullying or mockery. \n\tOn page 41, where it says that children reflect directly on their parents, it called to mind how my grandmother on my dad\u2019s side viewed everything pertaining to him and his family. Anything that was wrong with his children had to come from my mom\u2019s side of the family. His struggles in school were never willingly acknowledged by her, and she was always telling my parents how they were parenting wrong. The good news is, as social media and mainstream media have more of an impact on people\u2019s perception of mental health, that perspective may become less prevalent as people understand that mental disorders are a product of many factors coming together instead of just one or two things. \n\tEven the statement at the start of page 48 is something I\u2019ve experienced myself with my diagnoses. After spending the first 19 years of my life trying to be normal and failing miserably, having the answers to questions it had never occurred to me to ask felt amazing. Understanding that I was different and that there were ways that I could work with it made life more tolerable. I still remember that when my parents received word of my diagnoses, their general reaction can be summed up as, \u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d I was lucky that the child they \u201clost\u201d was an enigma, and the child they gained was a more complete picture. I was also lucky that as a result of the diagnoses, they were willing to work with me on academics and general life skills, instead of leaving me to wing it. \n\tReading about Doug having Julie in his life made me glad, since it looks like he had someone in his life besides his family that he felt comfortable not only being around but also opening up to. One thing that I\u2019ve learned, both through classes and personal experience, is that having the right therapist can be helpful in self-improvement, and the wrong therapist can be detrimental. Having someone that he was looking forward to sessions with sounds like it was a big part of his understanding and coming to terms with his situation. \n\tThe section of Doug\u2019s death and funeral again felt similar, to me, to when my grandmother died. The pain of losing a loved one, the transition from carer to mourner, even now still casts a shadow. Admittedly, my mom and aunt went from carers to grieving daughters, but that\u2019s still not easy. I don\u2019t know how it was for Dr. Engelman, but for my mom and aunt, my grandmother\u2019s death also brought with it a sense of relief. Death brought with it an end to my grandmother\u2019s suffering, and also meant that my mom and aunt wouldn\u2019t have to make any difficult choices regarding my grandmother\u2019s care. The toughest one they faced, since my grandmother at this point had advanced dementia, was whether or not to put her on a feeding tube. \n\tReading this book gave me a better perspective of how some of the things my family has gone through are more common than someone might think in the moment. I understand that the book was about a father\u2019s experiences with a schizophrenic son, but they also share similarities with a woman who goes from having bipolar disorder to having dementia, and also with a young man who had to wait until he was nineteen to learn that so many of the things he went through growing up were not normal, but they also were not his fault. The fact that these similarities can be shown between mental disorders of very different types and levels of care leads me to wonder how many other similarities there are between different disorders, and how much can be gained by opening up and sharing experiences with other people.\n\tI know that when Dr. Engelman told us about this assignment, he told us that he didn\u2019t want praise or acclaim, but he still deserves credit where it is due for being there for his son when he needed him. Mental disorders can drive wedges between family members, and lead to some relatives avoiding the \u201ccrazy\u201d family member, but he stood by his son and helped to the best of his ability. This book is written with the benefit of hindsight, but it is easy to look back on events and say, oh, I should have done this, I should have said that, stuff like that. In the moment, Dr. Engelman did what he could for his son, and it is a credit both to him and his son that his son was able to make the progress he did before he died. \nDoug had a support system in place that was able to help him come to terms with who he was and learn to adapt to situations. It sounds like his parents, his sister, even \u201cSaint Julie,\u201d all played very important roles in getting his life back on track. The fact he went from psychotic breaks to having a girlfriend and friends that helped him shows how much a person\u2019s life can change for the better when circumstances allow it. \nThis book was an interesting read in terms of understanding life with a family member dealing with a mental disorder from the perspective of the carer. It gave me a newfound appreciation for what my mom and aunt went through with my grandmother and also made me realize how lucky I was that my parents were accepting of my diagnoses and that society is less stigmatizing of people with ASD. This book was, quite honestly, enlightening, both for an outsider trying to understand the challenges of living with someone with mental disorders, and also from the perspective of someone finding out that they are not alone in what they are dealing with.\n",

This paper does not aim to judge whether the decline of the nuclear family, that historically has been encompassed by a male breadwinner and stay at home mother, is right or wrong; instead, it seeks to explain how these trends may evolve into 2035. By analyzing studies linking education level to marriage rates, the increasing participation of women in the workforce, the rise of the individualistic self, and the rise of cohabitation, this paper argues that marriage is becoming a rare and more selective institution, accessible primarily to those with economic stability.\nEducation has a complex relationship with marriage. A 2010 Pew Research Center study found that in 2008, 64 percent of college graduates were married compared to just 48 percent of individuals with a high school diploma or less. Both groups were equally likely to aspire to marriage, but those with less education placed more emphasis on financial stability before marrying (The Decline of Marriage and Rise of New Families, 2010). More recent research complicates this picture. Ahn and Winters (2025) found that higher education can delay marriage, particularly for adults aged 25 to 34, but it also increases marital stability, reducing the prevalence of divorce, separation, or widowhood (Ahn & Winters, 2025). Current trends point that the delay in marriage is also due to the rise in cohabitation. Today the rise of cohabitating with a partner before transitioning to marriage is becoming more of the norm. This trend as pointed out by Sassler and Daniel (2020) is more popular among college educated women. However, this transition of singlehood to marriage with cohabitation as the anchor point, has a thin line of separation and as referenced by Sassler and Daniel (2020) is primarily dependent on economic stability. The argument could be made that financial instability makes it harder for couples, even those who are college-educated to successfully transition from cohabitation to marriage. The rise in cohabitation has not only led to a decline in marriage but has also led to the new trend of couples choosing to have children within cohabitating relationships rather than waiting for marriage. The work by Sassler and Daniel (2020) highlight how between 2006 and 2010, childbirth from cohabitating women was at 23 percent. This percentage increased from 14 percent in 2003 (Sassler & Daniel, 2020). This trend helps paint the picture that for many couples in the U.S. having children has become a more prominent factor in forming partnerships than forming those same partnerships through marriage. The rise in cohabitation, whether due to economic pressures, evolution of social norms, and the decline of nonmarital births viewed as taboo by society, have made the raising of children within cohabitating couples socially acceptable. \nThis delay in marriage, combined with the increasing acceptability of childbearing withing cohabiting couples, interacts with the fertility patterns presented in the study by (Nitsche & Hayford, 2020). Their study highlighted fertility trends which show that highly educated women, particularly those desiring larger families, are more likely to remain childless, largely due to the fact that postponed marriage narrows the window for childbearing. Highly educated men who marry later also face higher rates of childlessness, though the effect is somewhat smaller. These findings suggest that higher education provides individuals with greater strategic freedom and independence, allowing them to prioritize careers and personal goals, but ultimately at the cost of a delayed family formation. Ultimately, higher education shapes marriage and parenthood in ways that make them more selective and strategic. While fewer highly educated individuals marry or have children at younger ages, those who do are more likely to form stable unions and make deliberate partner choices, signaling a shift from marriage as a universal milestone to a targeted life strategy (Nitsche & Hayford, 2020). \nCurrent research shows that this delay in marriage has also contributed to a comprehensive shift in society that researchers call the Second Demographic Transition (SDT). This shift in society emphasizes that personal choice, emotional fulfillment, and lifestyle preferences play a heavier role in family formation than traditional institutions like marriage. This shift in society from societal to individualistic norms is central to the SDT theory. As individuals pursue self-actualization and freedom. SDT helps explain both the decline in marriage and marital fertility and the simultaneous increase in childbearing and childrearing within cohabiting couples. I think that by 2035 marriage rates will continue to decline and cohabitation among partners and blended families will be the norm. This personal belief is supported by the study of Manning (2015) which highlights how in 2015, only 5 percent of unmarried single pregnant women got married before their child was born, ensuring the child was not born out of wedlock. This is a significant change compared to 1970 when 30 percent of single unmarried pregnant women got married before the child was born (Manning, 2015). From a blended family perspective, the study by Manning (2015) also shares how 37 percent of children in cohabiting families live with their step or half siblings. Manning also shares how this trend is more prevalent in cohabiting families than families with married parents. \nOverall, current data demonstrates how the level of education plays a key role in shaping how cohabiting couples transition into marriage as the economic outcomes associated with the formation of the family. As pointed out by Manning (2015) research demonstrates how parents in cohabitating households usually have a lower educational level than their married counterparts. This gap in education is closely tied to differences in income and wealth. As noted by Manning (2015) there is a 50 percent lower median income in cohabiting parent households compared to married households. Other disparities surface such as cohabiting parent households are also more prone to experience poverty, have scarce access to homeownership, and lack health insurance. All of which lead to financial burdens and undermine the long-term stable resources for children. These patterns aim towards the idea that education is a key factor in determining both the feasibility and strategic value of marriage. Couples with a higher education are more likely to obtain the economic and social resources needed to successfully transition from cohabitation to marriage, while those couples with a lower education level tend to remain in cohabitating relationships due to economic constraints and disparities. This trend falls right into place with the SDT framework, that emphasizes individuality, delayed marriage, and the prioritization of personal goals over traditional societal expectations. Given these trends, by 2035, marriage will no longer be a traditional institution but will evolve into a selective and strategic one. One where couples with a higher education and income will use these resources to consolidate economic stability, plan to intentionally have children, and form stable relationships. On the other hand, couples with lower education will tend to cohabit without moving to marriage. As both family formation and patterns of fertility are increasingly influenced and shaped by education and economic capability, this reflects a comprehensive shift in society that no longer views marriage as a universal norm but one that is a targeted strategic life choice. A choice that by 2035 will be selective to just those who can afford it. \n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAhn, K., & Winters, J. V. (2025). Causal effects of education on marriage.

        "text": "Why the Greatest Happiness Principle still persuades me\nIn practice, this maps onto how many of us already reason when stakes are high. Hospitals triage. Governments budget. Even in ordinary life I allocate time and attention where they do the most good\u2014helping a teammate who\u2019s struggling before polishing a slide that\u2019s already fine, or donating to a malaria charity that demonstrably saves lives rather than a vanity cause that merely makes me feel generous. Utilitarianism tells me I\u2019m not cynical for thinking about numbers; I\u2019m responsible.\nMill\u2019s insistence on qualitative differences in pleasures\u2014his \u201cbetter to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied\u201d\u2014also matters. It answers a caricature Sandel notes: utilitarianism is not addicted to shallow pleasures so much as committed to human flourishing broadly conceived. If reading, making music, or building a fair institution predictably deepens lives, then a utilitarian can rank those goods higher because they reliably produce more and richer happiness.\nThe best objections bite\u2014and change how I apply utility\nWhere Sandel presses hardest is also where my own view softened. The first worry is about rights. If maximizing the balance of happiness could justify punishing an innocent person to quell a riot, we sense the calculus has gone wrong. Similarly, we recoil at throwing the \u201cfat man\u201d off the bridge in the trolley problem even if it would stop the train. These cases remind me that some actions are wrong not only because of what they cause but because of what they are\u2014they use a person merely as a means. Mill tries to address this by building rights into the utility calculus (societies that protect rights do better overall), but the thought experiment exposes a limit: in extreme cases, rights look like side constraints, not merely rules of thumb.\nThe second worry is about measuring the unmeasurable. Sandel discusses cost-benefit calculations that put dollar values on human life\u2014the Ford Pinto case has become emblematic. While some valuation is unavoidable in policy (every speed limit and drug approval implies risk trade-offs), Sandel is persuasive that certain ways of doing the math can degrade what we value. If a spreadsheet treats a vulnerable group\u2019s suffering as a small externality, we haven\u2019t just made a calculation; we\u2019ve missed a moral reality. This pushes me toward rule utilitarianism: instead of justifying each act by its immediate payoffs, I favor rules that, if generally followed, predictably maximize well-being while protecting persons against being sacrificed in the name of efficiency.\nLibertarianism, obligation, and why negative rights matter yet don\u2019t settle the question\nSandel\u2019s neighboring chapter on libertarianism made me appreciate the moral power of negative rights\u2014the idea that others are obligated not to interfere with what I own and how I live, so long as I don\u2019t harm them. Libertarianism dignifies consent and bodily autonomy: no one may conscript my life plans for their purposes.\nI agree with that much. Yet utilitarianism warns me not to stop there. Libertarian freedom can ignore structural harms that are invisible if we fixate only on non-interference. A society that refuses to tax wealth to fund basic healthcare might pride itself on respecting self-ownership, but the predictable misery that follows is a moral cost we can count. This is where Sandel\u2019s examples involving civil rights and equal access resonate: sometimes the best way to protect everyone\u2019s negative rights over time is to invest in conditions that enable real options now. Freedom without capabilities rings hollow.\nRawls\u2019s difference principle as a friend, not a foe, to utility\nI read Rawls\u2019s veil-of-ignorance device as a utilitarian ally. Behind the veil, we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll be born into wealth or poverty, health or disability. In that uncertainty, it seems rational to choose social rules that maximize the floor, not just the average. Rawls\u2019s difference principle\u2014arrange inequalities so they benefit the least advantaged\u2014can be reframed as a risk-averse version of maximizing expected well-being. Large gains for those already well-off often return less happiness than smaller gains for those in severe need, because of diminishing marginal utility. So a safety net isn\u2019t charity; it\u2019s a predictable way to make the overall sum of well-being larger, in line with utilitarian aims, while also respecting persons by ensuring basic capabilities.\nAdmissions, merit, and telos: what are colleges for?\nSandel\u2019s line that \u201cadmission is not an honor bestowed for superior merit or virtue\u201d forced me to examine a comfortable story. If a seat at a university is simply a prize for individual excellence, then fairness looks like perfect rank ordering by scores. But Sandel reframes the practice through Aristotle\u2019s telos: to decide who should be admitted, first ask what the institution is for. If a college exists to create certain kinds of learning communities, to train citizens, to pursue research, and to serve the public good, then it may justly select a class that advances those purposes, not merely the highest test scores.\nFrom a utilitarian angle, this isn\u2019t a betrayal of fairness; it\u2019s a broader outcomes question. A class with genuine diversity of background and experience often yields better learning and better service to the public\u2014consequences that matter. But Sandel\u2019s caution helps: if we treat admission as pure social engineering, we risk instrumentalizing applicants for institutional goals. The sweet spot, I think, is to align individual opportunity with the mission\u2019s social payoffs\u2014a rule-utilitarian compromise that avoids fetishizing \u201cmerit\u201d while preserving respect for applicants as ends in themselves.\nMarkets and the Baby M case: the utilitarian case for guardrails\nSandel\u2019s discussion of surrogacy (and Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s critique) captures another utilitarian tension. On one side, allowing willing adults to enter contracts like surrogacy can increase overall happiness: infertile couples find families, gestational carriers are compensated, and the arrangement is consensual. On the other side, certain market logics can corrupt meanings and produce subtle harms\u2014turning parenthood into a commodity, exerting pressure on economically vulnerable women, or treating a child as the object of purchase. A purely act-utilitarian defense\u2014if both parties consent and the outcome is net positive, it\u2019s fine\u2014can miss long-run effects on dignity and social trust.\nMy takeaway is again rule-based. A regulated surrogacy regime\u2014cooling-off periods, independent counseling, clear parentage rules, bans on coercive contracts, fair compensation, and robust protections for the surrogate\u2019s health\u2014predictably produces better outcomes over time than either prohibition or laissez-faire. It keeps faith with the utilitarian aim (more families, less suffering) while honoring the non-fungible values at stake.\nObligations to strangers: the demanding edge of utility\nIf there is a part of utilitarianism that scares me, it is how demanding it can be once we recognize the scale of need. In the spirit of Peter Singer\u2019s \u201cshallow pond,\u201d Sandel gently pushes readers to see that distance and numbers don\u2019t erase obligation: if I would ruin my shoes to save a drowning child nearby, why wouldn\u2019t I forgo luxuries to save children far away? A consistent utilitarianism challenges my comfort. It demands giving effectively, voting for policies that reduce global suffering (pandemic preparedness, climate mitigation), and shouldering fair taxes to fund programs that prevent predictable harms.\nThis is where a utilitarian lens becomes not only personal but political. Cost-effective health interventions (vaccines, bed nets), emissions policies that prevent catastrophic harms, and housing rules that reduce homelessness all pass a straightforward maximizing test. Sandel\u2019s broader tour of justice reminds me that this is what politics is for\u2014to make the trade-offs explicit, to argue about the values we honor, and to choose the rules that leave the fewest people worse off.\nWhere I draw the line: utility with side constraints\nSo where does this leave my self-description? I\u2019m still a utilitarian because I think outcomes matter morally, and pretending otherwise often just hides whose outcomes we\u2019re ignoring. But I\u2019m a utilitarian who has learned from Sandel to value three constraints:\nRights as real limits, not just heuristics. We should adopt rules that refuse to sacrifice basic liberties even when a short-term calculus tempts us. Societies that keep those side constraints tend to do better anyway\u2014and, more importantly, they respect persons as inviolable.\nTelos as a guide to design. Before maximizing, ask what the practice is for. You can\u2019t optimize a university, a marriage, or a court unless you honor its purpose. Otherwise, utility talk becomes blind to meaning and invites corruption of value.\nDistribution matters. Because of diminishing marginal utility, how benefits and burdens are distributed is central to the sum of well-being. Rawls\u2019s veil formalizes that insight, and it dovetails with utilitarianism\u2019s concern for those at the bottom of the heap.\nThese constraints don\u2019t abandon utility; they discipline it. They push me toward rule utilitarianism and toward institutional design that predictably raises human welfare while protecting the values we cannot price.\nA few places I\u2019m still wrestling\nSandel encourages critique, not closure, so I\u2019ll end with the tensions I haven\u2019t fully solved:\nMeasuring what matters. We can count lives saved or years in school. But how do we incorporate dignity, belonging, or meaningful work without either hand-waving or reductionism? Mill\u2019s \u201chigher pleasures\u201d gesture in the right direction; I\u2019m still looking for better proxies that policymakers can use without cynicism.\nPreference formation. Utilitarianism often treats people\u2019s preferences as the inputs. But many preferences are shaped by unjust structures or advertising. Should a planner maximize current preferences or the preferences people would hold under fair conditions? Rawls\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on education and virtue here is not a luxury; it\u2019s the precondition for sensible maximization.\nPartiality and personal ties. If I must always choose the option that produces the most total good, how much partiality to family and friends is morally permitted? A rule utilitarian answer\u2014allow partiality up to the point where it predictably sustains valuable social roles\u2014seems right, but the boundary is fuzzy.\nSpeech and offense. Libertarian non-interference protects expression; utilitarianism asks us to weigh harms. In polarized environments, it\u2019s hard to separate transient discomfort (which may be the price of learning) from genuine degradation. Sandel\u2019s classroom method\u2014argue in good faith, name the values at stake\u2014models a practice whose telos is mutual understanding, not victory.\nConclusion: maximizing with humility\nSandel\u2019s book didn\u2019t convert me away from utilitarianism; it matured it. I still think the core moral demand is to reduce suffering and increase flourishing impartially. But I now see more clearly that the best way to do that, over time, is not to run a ceaseless act-by-act calculus. It is to adopt rules and build institutions that honor persons, respect purposes, and attend to fair distribution\u2014because human beings are not just containers of pleasure and pain but agents whose dignity and relationships generate the very goods we want to maximize.\nCalling myself a utilitarian, then, is less a declaration of a calculator\u2019s creed than a promise about attention: to count everyone, to face trade-offs honestly, and to choose policies that predictably leave fewer people worse off. Sandel\u2019s tour through Rawls\u2019s fairness, libertarian freedom, Aristotelian purpose, and market limits equips me with the humility to do that work better\u2014aware of the edges where numbers mislead, where rights must stand firm, and where the telos of a practice tells us what \u201cthe most good\u201d even means.\n",

        "text": "Soc-250-001\n19 September 2025\nJustice: What\u2019s The Right Thing To Do? \n\tMichael Sandel is an American political professor and philosopher. Michael Sandel teaches at Harvard and intends to get his students to answer the thought-provoking questions of our society and justice system. Sandel is known for his topics on democracy, justice, and ethics, and in this book specifically, he also proposes the ideas of past philosophers. I believe that many ideas that philosophers had then, are extremely relevant and common now, so I will be writing about those specific ideas that Sandel poses in this book. \n\tThis book in particular, was not an easy read for me. I have never pondered on topics revolving around justice prior to this class and this book. Considering I am a Tourism, Recreation and Sport major, I don\u2019t necessarily think about topics like price gaps, utilitarianism, telos, and veils of ignorance. However, I quickly realized how embedded these ideas and concepts are in our society today and how relevant they really are. I intend to go into greater detail into some of these specific topics in this paper but first I want to give my definition of justice that I had before learning about what it really is. Before reading this book and being a part of the social justice class, I thought justice was a way to give fair treatment and consequences. On page 19 of the book, Sandel writes, \u201cTo ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize- income and wealth, duties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors. A just society distributes these goods in the right way; it gives each person his or her due.\u201d After reading that for the first time, I realized that justice entails much more than I imagined. \n\tTwo topics that Sandel brings up in this book repeatedly are utilitarianism and libertarianism. Utilitarianism, founded by Jeremy Bentham, states that the highest principle of morality is to maximize happiness. This basically means that we should do whatever is best for the majority. Libertarianism on the other hand, says that everyone has a right to liberty and we have the right to do whatever we want with what we have, as long as we respect the right of other people to do the same. One example of this debate that is brought up in the book is wearing seatbelts. Libertarians would say that forcing everyone to wear seatbelts is infringing upon their freedom however a utilitarian would probably say that it is safer and better for the majority if everyone wore them. I would like to say that I would be a utilitarian but I know that I am stubborn and tend to want to do whatever I want so I think I would more so be a libertarian. For example, if the government decided to legalize drugs like narcotics, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily partake but I couldn\u2019t stop another adult from using them in privacy. \n\tI want to switch courses a little bit and talk about Aristotle. One major idea that came from Aristotle was \u201ctelos,\u201d meaning the final purpose or function of something. One specific thing Aristotle mentioned while on his topic of telos was the telos, or purpose, of the government. He thought that the purpose of the government was to provide laws to aid in safety, morality, virtue, and more. He thought that the government should be guiding us and helping us thrive in life. I most definitely agree with Aristotle on his idea about the telos of politics, or the government. I believe that our government is put in place to provide more answers than questions, to provide aid and help, to reassure, to keep us safe, and to do what is in the best interest of our nation and our society. I wanted to bring this specific point up because I wanted to talk about how the purpose of our government today is exponentially worse than what Aristotle experienced and mentioned. I truly believe that with our government, we are in one of the worst spots in history. Our nation is completely divided and are even going to extremes to hurt one another because of opinions and political views. For example, the situation with Charlie Kirk recently. He was killed because of his opinions that someone found as hateful. I think our government tends to be more focused on money than it is focused on the nation\u2019s safety and overall virtue. Our nation is more divided than ever and it\u2019s disgusting to see. It is hard to believe we are so far off from what Aristotle said was the purpose of the government. Another topic that relates to our government and its \u201ctelos\u201d is patriotism. \n\tPatriotism can be a controversial topic because of how our nation is today, as I mentioned before. One common question asked is, why are we obligated to our own country more than others? While I didn\u2019t necessarily choose to live in America, or to even be born at all, I believe that because I was born into this nation, that I should help uphold its values and I should do my best to do what is right for those around me. I think this also involves speaking up for change when our government is failing us. I believe that being able to feel patriotic about where you live is to truly believe in and experience goodness. We should be able to reap the benefits of a flourishing and thriving nation, not the other way around. It seems common today to have either no patriotism at all and to only have hate for where you live and what the people governing it are doing. On the other side, it seems common as well to have too much patriotism that you are a mindless follower of whatever you\u2019re handed. I brought up this topic of patriotism because it is something I feel very passionately about and I truly believe our society will not improve if we don\u2019t start recognizing when something is good and respectfully challenging something when it\u2019s not. \n\tAnother concept that I found to be very interesting about this book was the idea of our dilemmas of loyalty. Sandel poses the question \u201ccan loyalty override universal moral principles?\u201d on page 236. My answer to this question would be yes. I once watched a video about parents answering the question \u201cwould you kill someone for your child?\u201d and a shocking amount of parents said no. At least that was shocking to me. I would kill for any of my sisters or anyone close to me. If their life depended on me killing someone else, I would most definitely do it because I am loyal to them. For example, my older sister was caught shoplifting once and I was young at the time but I was with her. I was asked if I saw her take the items and while I had, I said no because I felt a strong sense of loyalty to my sister. It was strange because while it\u2019s a very small example, I knew that what she did was wrong and I didn\u2019t agree with her decision at all but my loyalty was overriding my morals at that point. The topic that Sandel posed was very complex and interesting to me while reading so I wanted to write about my thoughts in this paragraph. \n\tI want to circle back to Aristotle and bring up his views on justice, and our identities generally. Aristotle believes that we have a set identity when we are born and it is our purpose to fulfill that. On the other hand, Kant and Rawls believe that Aristotle\u2019s way of thinking leaves little room for choice and freedom. While I disliked many of Rawls and Kant\u2019s ideas throughout the book, I agree with the both of them on this topic. I believe that we should have the ability to choose freely what we pursue, where we work, who we become, and the kind of people we want to be. I think that Aristotle\u2019s identity for humans is bland and it would cause us to only ever do what is considered to be the right thing to do or the good citizen\u2019s choice. I think that you can\u2019t actually have an identity without mistakes. I think that you cannot fulfill your purpose without trying and failing at things. This would be my answer to whether or not our duties can be traced to an act of will or choice, a question Sandel wrote about in the section \u201cJustice and the good life\u201d in chapter 9. \n\tIn this paper, I chose to write about the philosophical topics from the book that Sandel posed. I found it to be transforming to sit and think about where my loyalties lie, what justice looks like, what the telos of something is, what patriotism means, and our identities in relation to justice. While I have my views on abortion, price gouging, same-sex marriage, and more similar topics, I wanted to focus on the points that really stuck out to me from this book. Overall, justice is seen in our everyday lives in small and huge ways and this book helped me get an idea of what it looks like and what some issues we face look like! \n\n",

        "text": "Midterm Paper\nTraditional household\u2019s vs modern trends \nThroughout American history, the family has been the foundation of moral order and social stability. However, over the past few decades, it has shifted dramatically. We have seen a decline in marriage rates, a rise in single-parent families, and a new wave of diverse family structures. These changes represent cultural changes towards individualism, gender equality, and economic change. \u00a0Many sociologists question what is lost when the traditional family structure weakens. As we look towards 2035, the difference between conventional households and modern family trends will define the new era of American family life. These modern family trends tend to emphasize flexibility and self-expression, where traditional households are grounded in commitment, stability, and shared values and viewpoints. These traditional viewpoints tend to be the strongest foundation for raising children and sustaining family and community life. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the last fifty years, marriages in America have shifted from being viewed as a social and religious obligation to a personal choice or lifestyle preference. \u00a0According to the Pew Research Center (2023), marriage rates have fallen to new historic lows. \u00a0With these declining rates, there has also been a new average age for first marriage, now 30. The reason for this shift is economic uncertainty, educational priorities, and a new cultural focus on personal fulfillment rather than collective responsibility. From a sociological viewpoint, this shift in declining marriages is a result of individualism (Cherlin, 2010). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By 2035, we can expect marriages to remain relevant but less tied to religious and communal expectations. There will be a rise in long-term partners and cohabitation among many Americans. However, research shows that stable marriages and two-parent households are better environments for young children. They tend to have better education, better well-being, and long-term economic stability (Wilcox & Marquardt, 2025). Even though our culture still gravitates toward flexible family arrangements, the traditional family and traditional marriage will remain the most stable and prosperous. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nuclear family model, in which men traditionally worked and women managed the household, has largely disappeared. In 2024, more than 70% of mothers with children under 18 were in the workforce (U.S. Department of Labor, 2024). This statistic shows both the economic necessity and the progress that women have achieved. By 2035, all families will likely depend on two incomes, making dual-earner households the norm in the United States. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This new shift has created an interesting condition: on the one hand, we have growing equality between men and women in the labor market, which continues to contribute to empowerment and financial independence; on the other hand, it hinders traditional family roles and increases stress on work-life balance. This new expectation that both parents must try to contribute equally to income and still be active in childcare is what Sociologist Arlie Hochschild called the \u201cSecond Shift.\u201d\u00a0 Which is the unpaid labor of homestead and childcare responsibilities. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a traditional household, labor is often divided more clearly. Each partner assumes specific responsibilities that support the family\u2019s stability and lifestyle. While this modern gender flexibility is valuable, sociologists have found that households that maintain clear role expectations, whether traditional or egalitarian, tend to experience fewer problems and more satisfaction than those without structure (Wilcox 2020). In 2035, we may have new hybrid family models that balance traditional clarity with modern equality. Things like remote working and flexible scheduling could make it easier for families to share household and economic responsibilities. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, there has been a significant rise in single-parent and blended families. This is one of the most visible modern trends changing American households. In 1960, 9% of children lived in single-family homes; the figure is about 25% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023). Economic and cultural factors have been the biggest reasons for these high divorce rates, nonmarital births, and delayed marriages. These families display resilience but often face significant sociological challenges. Research has shown that children raised by a single parent tend to face higher rates of poverty, lower academic performance, and increased behavior problems compared to those children raised in a stable traditional family. (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through blended families, remarriage and cohabitation are expected to be even more common in 2035. These living arrangements bring unique strengths, such as expanded support networks, but also require navigating very complex and emotional times. These patterns underscore the value of family and stability in long-term commitment. Families grounded in faith, communication, and mutual sacrifice tend to manage change and transitions better than families guided by personal satisfaction. While modern, diverse families will continue to be the norm, the traditional household will remain the benchmark for consistency and child development. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legalization of same sex marriage happened in 2015, and it marked a significant turning point for American family life. By 2035, it is expected that same sex families will be normalized within society. Sociologists say that this change expands the definition of the family, promotes acceptance, and reduces stigma. However, this evolution reflects a redefinition of family away from the biological and gender roles toward emotional and contractual ties. This recent trend shows how much our culture is shaping our understanding of family. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technology will play a significant role in shaping the family in 2035. Things like artificial intelligence, remote work, and digital education are already altering how families interact. From one perspective, these tools can create more opportunities for parents to be more involved with their kids when working remotely. However, factors such as screen time, digital isolation, and the lack of face-to-face communication pose a significant threat to intimacy and family bonds. Economic pressure will continue to affect families with rising housing costs, student debt, and childcare expenses, all of which discourage marriages and the idea of having children among the young generation (Pew Research Center, 2023). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Traditional households, which tend to have clear roles, strong community ties, and shared faith, are more likely to be affected by these new threats. A family that prioritizes family meals and rituals creates a personal connection, which serves as a counterbalance to the digital world. By 2035, families that limit technology in their homes and daily lives could live a healthier, more connected life with all the modern conveniences and a deeper level of relationships. \nIn 2035, the typical family will come in all shapes and sizes. There will be dual-income families, single parents, cohabiting couples, same sex parents, and blended families, all of which will remain present. Research still suggests that these families will maintain structure and stability while sharing moral values, and they will thrive. The traditional household in 2035 will look significantly different from one in 1950. It might have two working parents or rely heavily on technology, but it will still work. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modern families will continue to work with flexibility and equality, but they will rediscover that freedom without order leads to instability. As these social norms fluctuate, family values will likely experience renewed appreciation among Americans. However, the sociological evidence will remain clear. Children and communities will benefit most from stable, committed two-parent households that prioritize responsibility and structure. Traditional households will continue to serve as a model of resilience and clarity in a rapidly changing world. \nReferences\nCherlin, A. J. (2010).

        "text": "SOC 433-001\nOctober 14, 2025\nA Boy Broken Reflection\nWhen I first began reading A Boy Broken by Douglas Engelman, I didn\u2019t realize how much it would pull me in and affect me emotionally. The story felt heavy right away, almost like I was stepping into someone else\u2019s pain. Engelman writes, \u201clike someone trying to describe a nightmare, he weaves a disjointed, chaotic narrative, trying to bring me into this world of his\u2026a reality that he sees, hears, and feels\u201d (Pg. 13). That line stuck with me because it perfectly described how the story feels. The story is messy and heartbreaking but very real. It\u2019s like you\u2019re right there with Douglas and Doug Jr. trying to make sense of everything that has gone wrong. Reading about Doug\u2019s struggle with pain, confusion, and loneliness made me think about how deep emotional wounds can shape someone\u2019s entire life. Even though the story is dark, it also shows a quiet kind of strength where even when someone feels completely broken there\u2019s still a part of them fighting to heal whether they know it at the time or not. \nAs I read deeper into the book, I found myself feeling a mix of sadness, frustration, and empathy. The way Engelman writes makes Doug\u2019s emotions so raw that it\u2019s hard not to feel them. His words aren\u2019t just telling his story, but they pulled me into the chaos of his mind where he is trying to make sense of pain that\u2019s too big to even understand. Engelman writes about how he is sitting there listening to Doug Jr. describe impossible, frightening things that are impossible for him to imagine. This statement was gut wrenching for me because it showed how helpless Engelman must have felt, wanting to comfort Doug Jr. but realizing that some pain can\u2019t be fixed with words. It made me picture how lonely that kind of suffering must be. It is crazy to think that with these circumstances, the people who care most about you can\u2019t even truly understand what\u2019s going on inside your head no matter how hard they try. What struck me most about this was the feeling of quiet in those moment\u2019s, the pauses between Doug Jr.\u2019s words where I kind of felt the weight of everything he\u2019s been holding back and keeping to himself. This reminded me that sometimes the silence in a person\u2019s story says more than the words ever could. I think Engelman\u2019s writing captured that silence perfectly. The brief intermissions per say, between Doug Jr.\u2019s emotional explanations allowed a space to feel. During those points, I felt heartbreak, empathy, and humility. \nAs I continued reading, I kept finding myself thinking about how real it all felt especially because I knew it was their reality. I just kept thinking wow this was my professor\u2019s life at a time. That thought made the experience feel so different and honestly kind of strange at the time. It is one thing to read about trauma and heartbreak but it\u2019s another thing to realize that the person who wrote it actually lived through that pain. It made me see Engelman not just as a teacher but as a person who had survived something unimaginable and then had the courage to share it with others. Knowing that this was his real life and his family\u2019s real experience gave the book a heavier weight for me while reading. It also made me think about how many people I see daily walk around carrying stories that I\u2019ll never know. It also made me respect Engelman much more than I already did because he was brave enough to put his perspective and his son\u2019s story out into the world for others to read. It made me think about how much strength it takes to turn personal pain into something that can help others understand and feel. The more I read, the more I realized that this book wasn\u2019t just telling a story, but it was also teaching empathy. It was reminding me that behind every person even those who seem put together, there may be a whole world or battlefield we don\u2019t know about. \nAnother thing that really stayed with me was how this story made me think about the way we process grief and trauma. Everyone experiences pain differently, but Engelman showed how hard it can be to actually express that pain especially when words never seem to be enough. It reminded me of times when I\u2019ve seen people struggling silently, putting on a brave face while carrying things that no one else can see. Reading this made me more aware of how important it is to listen without judgment, even when I don\u2019t fully understand what someone is going through. I think one of the most powerful things about this book is how it shows that healing isn\u2019t a straight shot and there is no right way to do it. Engelman didn\u2019t try to make the story neat he let it be as chaotic as it was in real time for him, Doug, and their family. This made the story feel even more real for me. I think it\u2019s really rare to read a book these days where an author doesn\u2019t hide being the perfect language or a happy ending. This book shows the reality of trying to move forward while still carrying a weight. Reading about all the different perspectives through the book surrounding the difficult situation at hand made me think about how healing isn\u2019t about forgetting it\u2019s about finding a way to live with the pain and still choosing to keep going. \n\tToward the end I was really intrigued reading the short section about Engleman\u2019s daughter Melissa. Even though it was brief, it carried so much emotional weight and added a different kind of depth to the book. Up until that point, most of the focus had been on Doug Jr. and his struggles, so reading about Melissa gave me a different perspective on how the whole family was affected. What struck me most about this part of the book was how Engelman captured the way Melissa seemed to process things differently than everyone else in their family. Her presence in the story reminded me that pain doesn\u2019t just touch one person it spreads throughout everyone who love them especially family members. I thought it was interesting that Melissa\u2019s portion was not drastic or long, yet it still showed how individuals cope with loss and confusion in their own way. Melissa\u2019s message on the stairwell felt really close to home. It was such a simple act, but it carried so much emotion behind it. This was a reminder that grief doesn\u2019t always have to be loud to be felt deeply. \n\tBy the time I finished A Boy Broken, I realized this book left a mark in me that went far beyond just reading a story. It didn\u2019t feel like any other book I\u2019ve had to read for any other of my classes, it felt like an experience. I wasn\u2019t just reading about Engelman\u2019s family, I was sitting in their pain, walking through their memories, and trying to understand the weight they all carried. In my opinion, what really made this book great was how honest it was. Engelman let the truth out and allowed for it to sit and mingle. The book was raw and uncomfortable but then again that\u2019s what grief and trauma really are. What stood out to me most throughout the entire book was the never ending amount of compassion and love that was present even through the sadness. Engelman\u2019s words showed how love never really goes away, it changes form but it\u2019s always there. This book made me see love as fragile but also incredibly strong, something that can survive even when everything else feels broken. \n\tI also want to express how reading this book had me reflecting on how Engelman\u2019s story connected to the world outside of his. It really made me realize that everyone out there carries heavy things and we often overlook or judge them without realizing what they\u2019re living through. I definitely think that after reading this I need to be more understandings and patient with others but also with myself. I think everyone has their own story, their own pain, and their own way of trying to heal and Engelman\u2019s book showed me that but also made me feel that. That is the best part of this story, the way it is an experience, and you truly feel throughout it all. \n\tHonestly, I am grateful that I got to read this story and I am also grateful that Engelman was willing enough to share the truth even through the painfulness. Through Engelman\u2019s vulnerability, he not only gave his son\u2019s pain a voice but also allowed readers like me to see how love and grief can coexist. I think it is incredible to be courageous enough to write out your story, the good, the bad, and the messy all for the sake of helping others. This book was not an easy read, but it was a meaningful and thought provoking one. This book has taught me many things, but my biggest takeaway is that even in a dark place there can still be light. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nEngelman, D. J. (n.d.).

        "text": "My Reflection on A Boy Broken\n\nThe overarching themes of this story are plentiful, but one that sticks out to me most is family. Your perseverance in supporting Doug is admirable, as is your honesty with your shortcomings. I think that most individuals struggling with intense mental disorders do not have reliable support systems, financially or emotionally. The fact that Doug had a family that cared about him so much is so rare and special. As you discuss in the book, support systems are crucial for someone experiencing a severe mental disorder.  \n\tI really enjoyed the book\u2019s emphasis on social stigma and the labelling theory as it relates to mental disorder. Specifically, I found the discussion of public stigma and self-stigma, both definitionally and anecdotally, interesting. As we\u2019ve discussed in class, stigmas heavily influence mental health and the way that we view others who are suffering from disorders. Deviance from the norm, in any format, is often seen as \u201cweird,\u201d and we prefer to distance ourselves from those who don\u2019t behave in a \u201cnormal\u201d way. These kinds of public stigmas make people who suffer from mental disorders feel \u2018othered.\u2019 This may also affect their self-stigma. They may internalize this \u2018otherness\u2019 and use it to further distance themselves from society. Because of this, their relationships may deteriorate, they may not be able to hold jobs, and they may experience a decline in social class. \n\tAnother part of the memoir that I found especially interesting was when you were explaining the stages of grief as it relates to finding out about Doug\u2019s schizophrenia. This serves as a reminder that grief comes in many formats, not just after death. One of my favorite classes that I\u2019ve taken at UNCW has been Sociology of Death and Dying. In that class we heavily explored the stages of grief, and how grief can be experienced as a result of many different events. I enjoyed how you explained each stage through the lens of how you were processing the news of Doug\u2019s diagnosis. I also liked that you pointed out that you couldn\u2019t see the stages clearly at the time, but upon reflection years later you were able to group parts of your story into distinct emotions and stages. I am sure that your grieving process upon the news of Doug\u2019s death manifested itself in different ways. People grieve differently, but ultimately, similarly. While the stages are interesting, it is also important to note that they are not linear, and they never really \u201cend.\u201d \n\tI appreciated the rawness of your explanation about your guilt in trying to hide your son\u2019s schizophrenia from others. I feel like this is something that many people with someone close to them who has a mental disorder goes through, but feels like they can\u2019t talk about. The stigmas around mental health made you feel like, at least for a while, you couldn\u2019t share your son\u2019s struggle with your friends and family without being judged. While I, specifically, have not dealt with someone close to me experiencing a severe mental disorder, I do have an uncle who experienced a severe drug addiction throughout my childhood. I know my parents attempted to shield me from this in many ways, which I\u2019m sure you did for your younger children as well. He has been sober and living alone for several years now, and my dad\u2019s role in his recovery is not lost on me. My dad also displayed unconditional love, perseverance, healthy boundaries, and caretaking for his brother during his lifelong struggle with substance abuse. \nIn that way, this novel kind of reminded me of the film \u201cBeautiful Boy.\u201d \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d is based on a memoir written by a father as well. That movie, much like this book, details a father\u2019s struggle with his son\u2019s mental state, although in \u201cBeautiful Boy,\u201d the son is experiencing severe substance abuse and drug addiction. Additionally, there are \u2018scenes\u2019 in both in which the son goes missing and the father is helpless in his search for him. In both stories, the father figure searches for meaning among the grief he is experiencing by feeling like he is losing his son to something beyond his control. Both are profoundly moving and beautifully depict the relationship between fathers and sons. Furthermore, both are important in sharing real-life stories about struggles with mental health and substance abuse. \nAnecdotally, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder when I was 16 years old. This seems like a pretty common occurrence for young women my age. That was my first glimpse into the world of mental health. As someone who was raised in a very conservative, Southern Baptist household, I was always taught that you could pray away sadness and anxiety. It wasn\u2019t until I was in high school that I realized that the anxiety I felt on a daily basis was not the norm. I filled out a questionnaire at the pediatrician\u2019s office and was in therapy within a month. My experience with therapy was less than ideal. I have also been on medicine at different points in my life, with varying success. All this to say, discussions about mental health are essential. Especially, as the Epilogue covers, during the present time, when so many young people struggle. I relate to your passion in wanting to make conversations about mental health more accessible and more normalized, especially in the school setting. No one should feel \u201cothered\u201d or stigmatized because of struggles with their mental health. Accurate and factual information is also important, as no one should be made to feel as if they could \u2018pray it away.\u2019\nOverall, I really enjoyed reading this memoir. I enjoyed the way that the story was easy to follow, but interspersed with theories, statistics, and real-life information about mental disorders. Often, it seems like people are content to be ignorant about certain topics until it happens to them. Apathy is the norm when it comes to mental health, until an individual is personally affected by it. This memoir is a glance into the life of someone who didn\u2019t have much of an awareness about mental health, but who used his son\u2019s experiences as a catapult to educate himself about disorders, social stigma, and treatment. \nYour experiences, as told through this memoir, are important in many ways. It should serve as an example to readers, how you can use adversity to learn, grow and change. Mental health is something that we should all take an interest in, because it affects so many people in our everyday life. It may one day affect someone close to me. It is an important topic to be interested in, educated in, and to care about and advocate for. Voting is an essential way that we, as a society, can change the policies around mental health and mental health treatment. Being more aware of the problem is the only way that we can take necessary steps to fix it. If social structures are some of the main factors that lead to mental disorders in certain populations, the question becomes: what can we do to fix it? How can we better serve populations most prone to mental disorders? How can we break down gender norms and make space for every individual to feel comfortable to share their emotions and seek treatment? How can we better serve our unhoused population who have mental disorders? \nThis class, and specifically, reading this memoir, have made me even more passionate about mental health awareness. Mental disorders can happen to anyone, at any time. Negative events, drug usage, even age can bring upon mental disorders on anyone. It is important to be knowledgeable about mental health and to be able to provide support to those we love who may be struggling with it. Additionally, I am a Criminology major and plan to work in Victim Advocacy in the future. I will be dealing with individuals with mental health issues who have been through traumatic events. Knowing about mental disorders is so useful and important for everyone in our generation and beyond. This memoir was an honest and important glimpse into your life, which was shaped and changed by your son\u2019s journey with schizophrenia. It serves as a reminder that it could happen to anyone. It inspires readers to be more empathetic, to realize that we don\u2019t always know what others are going through, and to advocate for mental health. ",

        "text": "Lilly Thomas \nSOC 345\n20 October 2025\nFamily Dynamics in 2035\n\tFamily dynamics in the United States have been changing throughout the past one hundred years. Beginning with the integration of women in the workforce, and most recently the rise in diverse family structures, it is quite clear that the \u201ctypical\u201d family in the United States is shifting. There has been a steady decline in marriage rates alongside a rise in divorce rates. While this can partially be attributed to women gaining the right to divorce their husbands without fear of repercussions, there are many other factors, such as economic pressures, cultural values, and social media\u2019s influence. In addition, gender roles continue to shift and are a controversial topic of conversation. Many believe that all marriages and/or relationships should be egalitarian, while others believe that traditional gender roles should be adhered to. This paper will discuss the ways in which family dynamics have shifted in the United States, as well as examine what the \u201ctypical\u201d American family could look like in the year 2035. \n\tThroughout the past one hundred years, marriage and partnership trends have begun to change and fluctuate. As mentioned, the decline in marriage rates has been a topic of conversation. Many wonder why exactly there is a decline. The marriage rate decline is due to a multitude of factors. Firstly, the cost of living has gotten so expensive that many couples choose to avoid a long-term commitment. Secondly, it is now far more normalized for a woman to value her education and career over getting married and having children. This is mainly because women no longer have to rely on a man to support them financially. Due to this, women are choosing not to get married and instead focus on their education and career. Thirdly, because the divorce rates are so high, it discourages couples from getting married in the first place. Lastly, today, cohabitation is far less stigmatized than it has been in the past. Therefore, getting married may feel \u201cpointless.\u201d\n\tParenting and household structures have begun to see a shift as well. Women are no longer forced to stay in unhealthy relationships, which has resulted in an increase in single-parent households and co-parenting. Similarly, blended families have also become more normalized. As new styles of parenting come about, so do transformations of gender roles and work-life balance. With the steady increase in technology, new and innovative ways to care give are offered. For example, online homeschooling, AI, and digital monitoring (i.e., parental control apps, location tracking, baby monitors, etc). There has been a steady rise of women in the workforce, and this is a result of many factors. One being that fathers are being held more accountable than ever before. Therefore, it is becoming normalized to be a stay-at-home father while the mother is the breadwinner. Another factor is online job opportunities. Even if a mother desires to be a stay-at-home mom, she now has the freedom to work from home (and vice versa for stay-at-home dads). Essentially, the egalitarian lifestyle has developed into a feasible option for many households; however, it can show itself in more ways than one.  \n\tMany cultural and economic factors influence a family dynamic. These can be race, class, economic pressures, and the reliance on extended family and community support, just to name a few. The economic pressures that a family is placed under play a vital role in the overall family dynamic. In the United States, housing, healthcare, and childcare costs are pretty much unfeasible for the vast majority of families. This commonly results in families relying on extended family for financial support. This could be living with them, asking them to watch the children, or even helping pay for groceries, gas, doctors\u2019 bills, etc. Thus, leading to changes in the definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d While the \u201ctypical\u201d American family may seem like a married couple living with their children, that is simply a common stereotype. As mentioned, many couples never marry, have children together, and cohabitate. Other families may live in a multigenerational household consisting of immediate family (husband, wife, and children) alongside grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. As mentioned by Andrew Cherlin, marriage has gone through an era of deinstitutionalization, accompanied by the normalization of same-sex unions as well as cohabitation. Thus, leading to the era in which America is currently experiencing. \u201cThat marriage has undergone a process of deinstitutionalization\u2014a weakening of the social norms that define partner\u2019 behavior\u2014over the past few decades. Examples are presented involving the increasing number and complexity of cohabiting unions and the emergence of same-sex marriage.\u201d (Cherlin 848).\nWhen discussing diverse family dynamics, LGBTQ families and their inclusion into modern spaces are a hot topic. Now more than ever before, LGBTQ couples and families are being provided greater visibility when it comes to family norms. For many years, it was an extremely taboo topic that caused great controversy. While the controversy has not necessarily ended, LGBTQ individuals, couples, and families are able to integrate themselves into spaces without the fear of legal repercussions. There continue to be people who are against this; however, there is an undeniable amount of social acceptance that accompanies the legal protections. In addition, LGBTQ couples are provided with more pathways to parenthood than previous generations. Although they cannot conceive naturally, adoption and surrogacy are options that are no longer restricted by means of public policies that were inherently and clearly discriminatory. \n\tAs mentioned previously, technology has made a significant impact on family life. Not only does it aid parents in everyday tasks and help them monitor their children\u2019s safety, but it also provides a space for virtual family gatherings (Zoom), communication through apps (groups on Facebook), as well as smart home tech. This is something that seems to have taken flight during the COVID-19 pandemic and has since integrated itself into the everyday life of a person and their family. Just twenty years ago, the idea of video-chatting seemed foreign. Nowadays, it is just another way of easy communication with one\u2019s family, no matter how far apart they may be. \n\tThe \u201ctypical\u201d family in 2035 is on track to look far more diverse when compared to a family fifty years ago, or even today. While I do not foresee an extreme change in just ten years, there seems to be a great possibility of a continuing shift in priorities when it comes to marriage and having a family. By 2035, the \u201ctypical\u201d American family will, on average, lean towards the egalitarian model. The traditional nuclear model will continue to fade with an increase in single parents, co-parenting, cohabitation among partners, blended families, multigenerational households, and LGBTQ families. The nuclear model will not be obsolete but will exist alongside a much more diverse range of family models. Furthermore, with an increase in opportunities for women, the marriage rates will continue to decline. With women no longer having to marry in order to live comfortably, they may feel as if marriage and a family would hold them back from achieving their long-term goals.  \n\tIn conclusion, the \u201ctypical\u201d family in the United States has changed significantly throughout the past one hundred years and is only continuing to evolve. While family is a concept that most strive to have, the ways in which it is created are ever-changing. Women\u2019s integration into the workforce has caused a decline in marriage rates simply because women no longer must rely on men. Since then, cohabitation, single parenting, and co-parenting after divorce have become far more normalized. With these family dynamics becoming less taboo, individuals and couples have been more inclined to simply go against historic social norms when it comes to starting a family. Furthermore, the concept of LGBTQ families is no longer criminalized and/or prohibited by law. With this has come opportunities for these couples to become parents through adoption and surrogacy. While many American citizens look down upon and judge those who do not subscribe to the nuclear family model, it is no secret that other family models are becoming more prominent. This is an increase that will continue to happen within the next ten years. By 2035, the \u201ctypical\u201d American family will be continuing to shift and strive for more egalitarian models alongside a growing acceptance of diversity, technology, and flexible familial roles within the household that aim for connection and equal responsibility.

        "text": "Engelman\nSOC-433-001\n09 September 2025\n\nA Boy Broken by Douglas J. Engelman - Mid-Term Reflection\nWhat does it mean to keep hope in the face of relentless despair? A Boy Broken reveals this through a father\u2019s journey and sociological perspective of the trials, rewards, and tribulations of his son\u2019s life with schizophrenia. The stigma of mental illness is a long lasting, penetrating topic that can inhibit one\u2019s recovery and fall on the family of the people suffering. Most of the time the perspective of the family is not thought of but from personal experiences, I too know how it feels to live this reality. Some people may make mistakes on this hard course of the unknown through loss, grief, caregiving, and tough love; this story does provoke deep emotions, especially to me, as I was not always prepared in these situations. The mental health of all family\u2019s needs to be acknowledged and made aware of helpful ways to use their experiences for the better and to help others in society diminish the stigma. \nThe story starts with the end, the shock of coming back to reality, the narrow acceptance of a father hearing of the death of his son, Doug. In the words of Engelman, \u201c...is now just a body\u2026I imagine it cold, broken, and lifeless on a stainless-steel table in the darkness of the hospital morgue.\u201d. But let's start with the beginning of this journey. In April 1991, 7 years before the death of his son the events began, Doug was on his sister Melissa\u2019s porch repeating \u201cwhy do they have to die?\u201d This wasn\u2019t normal for Doug and scared his sister. She didn\u2019t know what to do, she had never experienced anything like this, she called the authorities, Officer Thomas. Officer Thomas alluded that Doug may be schizophrenic, their uncle Harry had been diagnosed in his 20\u2019s, this could be true. Of course, hearing this as a parent and seeing your child in dirty clothes, preoccupied, and having a psychotic break you don\u2019t want to believe it. Doug explained to his father that there are two people who were \u201calways with him\u201d, a guy named Dave who taunts him about being gay, and a girl named Wendy. This reminds me of when I first began seeing the signs that my mother had bipolar disorder II, I was just nearing my last years of high school, I had never seen any other signs or even known about the illness. I experienced lots of emotions when I found out she was suffering, and I was really the only main one there for her, I didn\u2019t know what would come. I remember I had to either involuntarily commit her, or there would be worse consequences in the justice system, for the first time at just 16 years old. I heard the cop in the background talking bad about my mother and how he knew her in the past, displaying the same awful stigma that most law enforcement leads with. When really, he didn\u2019t know her, what she was going through, or anything of the sort for that matter. Another moment when we began arguing a lot, I felt like it was because she wasn\u2019t herself, but she told me \u201cI\u2019m the same, I have always been this way\u201d; this made me come to the realization that I too was making her into the disorder herself and not seeing who she really is. \u201cI can\u2019t see her\u2026but I believe you.\u201d, people struggling with mental illness bring us into their chaotic world, and what it\u2019s like but the major thing they need is someone that is going to listen and be there for them. We feel like we know this person so well, and hope that it was all just temporary. My experience as a child with a parent with a mental disorder may differ but it is also all in the same. Doug confided in his father by telling him of the diagnosis, at the McDonalds, an important moment and it brings back feelings of their past, divorce, childhood; Doug being left repeatedly by his father during his young, estranged relationship with Bobbie, Doug's mother, until now where his father had to silently promise to never leave him again, to commit. I wish the conversation could have been as open and honest, in my experience but it wasn't. It hit me like a truck, just as it does for lots of families in society, especially because I have a little brother that was too young to understand, and I had no idea how to explain it to him. I bottled all my emotions in, and I didn't want to talk to anyone, no one understood, and I was going through my own battle during all of this all alone, but she is my mom. Although I have experienced all these feelings and instances of this book, it still helped me, and I know it helps others. \nNow what? That\u2019s the question everyone is left with. People with mental disorders \u201cmost likely lack insight into the existence of the illness and may even reject the idea of a cure.\u201d This all plays into stigma, society sees people as socially deviant or exhibiting behavior out of the norm of their culture, stereotypes, and values. \u201cStigma is a \u201csocially constructed\u201d determination of disgrace and disapproval that can lead to profound disadvantages by those bearing the stigma.\u201d A theory apart included in stigma is the symbolic interactionist theory, which explains that \u201cthe meaning of actions and social objects are not inherent in those objects but rather, are formed through interpretation and definition in social interaction\u201d. There are numerous different views that can describe stigma, Georges Herbert views stigma as society norms providing the framework for his own actions. Charles Horton Cooley explains that they come to see themselves as others see us. And Lemert believes that a person sees themselves as deviant, that society has created by making \u2018rules\u2019. Again, stigma can be a barrier to recovery from mental illness, creating public and self-stigma. When a person is labeled as a mental illness it triggers negative stereotypes like fear and danger, when they really aren't. This can lead to changes in one's identity, some even say \u201cit was how he was raised\u201d. Altered family relationships are created from stigma; it provides a negative social framework where family has to reorganize their day-to-day routines. They must help cope with the idea that their family members will no longer be seen as acceptable in society, they feel the need to change them. \u201cBurden falls on the family, both become the object of stigma, strained and distant relationships.\u201d Doug\u2019s father even hid him from his neighbors, society, everywhere, and everything to hide the fear and reality of telling the truth. He started creating false stories about what he wished Doug and Melissa\u2019s life was really like, he hid them because of their mental illness and because of what he thought it would reflect on him, his family, and his parenting. Living with a mental illness and seeking counseling is stigmatized, the fear of rejection from many from pursuing opportunities and dreams prohibits them. There was shame and denial, both his children had a mental disorder, even though Doug was doing good he still wanted to hide the mental illness. He didn\u2019t start sharing the real Doug until it was too late. Doug was in and out of group homes, mental facilities, therapy, apartments, it was a lot for his father and family. I feel it was probably hard on Melissa also because most of the attention was on Doug when she was going through her own mental situations. \nWhen a parent or child experiences a loved one being diagnosed with a mental illness, there is a sense of loss, it seems like the person is different, but still there. There are events out of the norm that we are unprepared for, and they believe they could have prevented it in some way in this long process of grief. \u201cUnlike death, there is no \u201cobject\u201d to mourn\u201d, they are still there with them, but the person is unrecognizable, or even unlikable but the family has to commit to care and support. Therapists even have a tough time addressing the grief of family members. Grief started when Doug told his father about his diagnoses as they sat at the McDonalds. \u201cMy little boy, now a broken man, was a stranger, my son was gone.\u201d Grief includes 1. Denial, 2. Anger, Doug was angry at himself as a parent, angry at God, and angry at Doug for the substances he may have used before this. 3. Bargaining, Doug\u2019s father thought if Doug would just do what the doctors told him, he could be a part of the tiny fraction of survivors. \u201cBut this is what grief like ours does. It resists acceptance. It allows anger to consume love. And it allies hope to obscure reality.\u201d 4. Depression, there is loss of hope that manifests, this is the quiet stage, last there is 5. Acceptance, understanding the reality of what everyone is really going through, a productive and joyful life is possible and there is potential for more positive outcomes and relationships. When you are a close family member of one with a mental illness, you can become a caregiver. Doug's father never saw it as caregiving, and neither do I with my mom, but that\u2019s what it is. My mom takes care of herself for the most part, but there are times when this is needed. \u201cOverall, caregivers describe feelings of isolation, financial difficulties, relationship problems, and physical complaints related to their caregiving roles.\u201d There is lots of investment, time and energy that goes into caregiving and can even offer a sense of purpose. But like most we are often scared and anxious of what could happen when we are not there. Families that don\u2019t have it so well and lack certain resources experience even greater stressors, discrimination, and economic insecurity. Doug went to Loyola mental facility where they prevented family interaction, he then transferred to Madden and stayed in a group home for 6 months, this was a good thing for Doug, the meds were helping push the images away, although they were still there. I have seen my mom go through many health evaluations until they settled on Latuda. The only thing about this medicine is that she's been taking it for over 10 years and if it gets out of her system, she will most likely have a manic episode. Family members don\u2019t know the direct stress of people suffering, what is going on in their head. We are there for the evaluations, the therapy, the ups and the downs, and losing everything and starting all over again. Again, and again, but there are good parts and good can come out of it. There are downs but the ups are so much greater that they pull us out of this rut into something much better, my faith in God has helped realize we cannot control these situations, and we cannot change the person, but we can give them grace, learn their triggers, and not challenge them when they are in need.\n But sometimes they need a little tough love, Doug was allowed a weekly allowance and received disability that his father managed most of the time. When Doug was at the group home, he was having some challenges and often stated that his money was being stolen. He even tried to buy a dime bag of marijuana but got conned out of his money. Doug had to learn some responsibility. His father was upset with him that he was smoking on his meds and wanted to go off. But he gave Doug grace, it couldn't have been amazing for Doug, \u201cDo you have any idea how shitty life is here? Nothing to do. No real friends. I just wanted to feel good for a little while.\u201d This was understood and although Doug would buy weed again, he learned not to be so trusting, as he was vulnerable. This tough love helps strengthen their relationship. But then Doug showed up out of the blue one night, saying he couldn't go back to the group home, and he wanted to leave because there were guys that \u201cwere going to kill him\u201d because they thought he was gay. Doug\u2019s father said he could not stay there, this made him upset, but he knew it was for the best. Until Doug didn\u2019t show up to the group home and went missing for three weeks. I know that during the manic episodes with my mom, they didn\u2019t occur frequently, but they did last a little time. Often, I would go without talking to her and had to stop by her house to check on her. One thing she thought was that all the electronics were bad, she was being tracked. During these times, I was really the only one my mom would trust, until I wasn\u2019t. It saddened me when she would see me as the enemy or think that things were happening that weren't. But I had to learn the right approach, arguing with her and not accepting was not going to help. Things were said that I think about on the regular, I wondered did she mean these things, there was no way she didn't know she was saying. Dealing with these bouts changed me, for the better and for the worse sadly. Sometimes I would have no idea where my mom was, I would have to look for her, who was going to be there for her. All while I was trying to establish my life and finish college.  Her childhood was very tough, and her siblings were not close, their mother and father also suffered from their own mental illness. My mom is also the only child that helps my grandmother with her mental disorder. Doug's father searched for him high and low until he received a call from Doug at a homeless shelter, ah the relief to hear their voice, to know that they are okay. Doug's father cherished the late-night ride back through the city. Yeah, you're probably pissed, but they are okay. \nThrough Doug's journey on the streets, he did pretty well, it had changed him for the better, but he learned that he was very fortunate to have help from Madden and security at the group home. Doug decided to get an apartment with another resident and become more independent. Then Doug decided to move back with his mom in Pittsburg, staying in his programs of course. But his mom was battling her own mental health issue, so he tried to move in with his sister and work at an art studio, he had frequent run-ins with the Dermont police. He moved from Dermont to Mercy behavioral health facility, where he met his therapist Saint Julie. Saint Julie understood Doug in a different way no one else had and Doug trusted her, this would be different. \u201cDoug began to show indications of introspection and mature thought that he had never been able to express before his therapy with Julie\". Doug had moved back to Pittsburg and became more open in social interactions with women. \u201cDoug has gained greater insight into his disease; he developed greater understanding of the influence drugs had on his mental health and was able to remain abstinent.\u201d Doug found a woman he really liked; with more confidence she liked him for him. She didn\u2019t even realize he had mental illness, they had a true connection, and this was great for Doug. Doug's father was so happy for Doug and Doug knew he was doing great; things were on the up and up. Until Doug passed away on December 19, 1998. Dougs father went back to see Doug's apartment after the funeral in Cary. He thought it would be a mess, disorganized, and unclean. But instead, it was organized, clean and he even had a Christmas tree with a present from his dad and presents for his little siblings. He was taking care of himself, and he was happy, his dad was happy. \u201cThis would be his legacy; this was proof that this once broken young man was putting the pieces of his life back together. I have recalled that visit, viewing my son's life through his habitat, hundreds of times. It has helped me so often to think about how he had grown, about my journey with him, and the person that he had become through his disease and recovery.\u201d Today, my mom is doing great, she is still here improving her life for the better, in a good area. I can say that seeing our family members with mental illness do good and better is the best thing, we were a part of the journey. It was long, it was hard, there were tears and smiles, but we made it. Every day we continue to make it and keep going. This book made me cry, smile, and relive trauma from my past experiences. I wish this book was here for me at that time, but it has done its job in helping me, one person, and I hope it continues to help everyone else in society.",

        "text": "SOC-250-001\n20 September 2025\nReflection #1: Issues in Women\u2019s Health and Work\n\tAs a woman in this society, I run into many obstacles related to my health and have to make decisions or deny \u201chelp\u201d to better my health. Women are stuck between a rock and a hard place in today\u2019s society. There are debates about what we should do with our bodies, more accurately, what to do with our wombs. Women\u2019s reproductive rights are the highlight of governmental arguments, how abortion is murder, how it is not murder, how it needs to be an option for women and young girls who have been raped, how women have to be sentenced for aborting their baby, etc.. We have limited access to contraception, and would have to go to a health professional to spend hundreds of dollars. There are arguments that have arisen where women should or should not be about to have contraceptives over the counter. In society it is clear that women are not responsible for our own reproductive rights.\nAccording to Sandel, utilitarianism focuses on getting the ultimate happiness for all, and libertarianism focuses on individual liberties and the protection of their rights. Utilitarianists would look both ways, in supporting ways and going against abortion. A utilitarian supporting abortion would focus on the suffering of a pregnant woman because she is going through an unwanted pregnancy. In order to end her suffering, abortion would be considered a good solution. The woman would be struggling mentally and economically, which can lead a life that is unpleasant for her child. It is argued that the child would grow up in a household that is not full of life, but unstable. In order to prevent that, an abortion must occur. A utilitarian going against abortion would focus on the harming of the woman\u2019s fetus. Killing a fetus can cause harm to many, but mostly to the mother. The mother will have to endure the pain during the procedure, but after the procedure too. Many women, and society, do not understand that abortions take a toll on the body and can cause us many reproductive issues. Just like utilitarianists, a libertarianist would argue two sides for abortion. A libertarian focuses on pro-life and pro-choice. The pro-life argument shows that the fetus has a right to be alive, and to continue growing in its mother\u2019s womb. It considers abortion to be an act of violence on another human being. The pro-choice argument states that a woman is her own, she has the right to do anything she wants with her body. A woman's liberty is violated, if she is forced by the government to keep a baby that she does not want. Under this argument, the government cannot and should not tell a woman what she needs to do with her body. \n\tFor contraceptives, utilitarianists and libertarianists have different arguments. A utilitarianist would support the idea of contraceptives, if they are accessible to women, or to all. Contraceptives can help women prevent unwanted pregnancies and have intercourse safely. It can be beneficial for women\u2019s reproductive health. It can allow our menstrual cycles to be less painful and lighter. It allows companies to make profit off of women and it allows us to prevent pregnancies, which benefits society as a whole. A libertarianist would believe that contraceptives should be available everywhere, and that it should be accessible without having the government involved. Women should be able to have control over what we put in our bodies, instead of being prevented from doing so.\n\tIn my eyes, abortion is not beneficial in any way. If a man and a woman want to have intercourse, they have to take precautions to avoid pregnancy. In cases that a woman gets pregnant because of the lack of contraceptives, the baby should be kept. It was the parents actions that allowed them to get pregnant, abortion is not the key. I agree with the libertarian view, where abortion is harmful because the baby is a human being. The fetus, no matter how many weeks old, is being taken out of its only life source and that is the mother. After an abortion occurs, not only does it kill the fetus but it messes with the woman\u2019s reproductive health or health in general. When women and men make choices that put them in this predicament, there is no going back and it kills a poor innocent human being. The government does not agree with abortion, but wants to charge women to get on birth control. If they want to prevent abortions, contraceptives should be available to women. When they are available to women, we would no longer be at risk for a pregnancy that we may not be ready for. \n\tHealthcare has been advancing over the years. There has been more technology, more education on life changing procedures, but the one thing that isn\u2019t being advanced is women\u2019s healthcare. Women are struggling to find professionals who would be willing to listen to what we have to say is happening to our bodies, or what we are experiencing. Healthcare professionals are not taking into consideration how women feel when we are getting check-ups, implants, or any other medical procedures. Every woman has shown that we are not in any way comfortable with healthcare professionals, we believe that they are doing what they do because it is just a job to them. To add to this belief, pregnant women have to deal with these professionals who do not want to take care or help in any way possible. Many women have stories about how Gynecologists and other healthcare professionals have wronged them, or have done procedures that caused them discomfort and pain. Women go through life-changing things, one of those things is becoming a mother. Society feels that if women can go through life changing things, they will be able to not take breaks with their child. Many companies do not allow maternity leave or paternity leave, and if they do, it is not a long time. The time for maternity or paternity leave varies by company, and sometimes it is unpaid. Many companies do not view maternity leave as something necessary, and it enrages society and new mothers. \n\tHealthcare, according to the utilitarian view, is supposed to help women and their well-being. Healthcare being something for the public as a whole benefits everyone, there is nothing that can prevent healthcare from being useful. According to the libertarian view, healthcare is a service and not an individual\u2019s right to have. It is believed that women should not pay for our healthcare services, but have to pay for others who are not able to pay for their own. Women not only have to worry about our own healthcare, but we also have to worry about other individuals taking their money through insurance. \n\tMaternity leave through the lens of a utilitarian and libertarian differ in many ways. Utilitarianism views maternity or paternity leave as a beneficial thing for the mother and baby. The leave should be paid, and that gives mother and baby time together. It helps their health, giving the baby time with its mother and allows the mother to heal after giving birth. When the mother spends more time with her child, the more they have a stronger bond. It also helps reduce any mental health issues that could have arisen if she was to work straight after giving birth. Libertarianism views are against paid maternity or paternity leave, it is believed that the leave should not be a mandatory thing as they are interfering with the work space. \n\tHealthcare and maternity leave have to be available for all women. I believe that women\u2019s healthcare should be advanced and affordable. They should also have the say in what professionals think is best for them to do, women most likely go with what the professionals say. More recently that has not been the case, and women have gone with their gut feeling. Healthcare should be more than a way to get money, but also have the patients in mind. Maternity leave is something that all women should be given the opportunity to do. Women need the chance to be with their child and to be allowed to better themselves before going back to work. I agree with the views from the utilitarianists for maternity leave, because it is important for both the baby and the mother. If a mother has to directly go into work after giving birth, there will be no or weak connection between her and her baby. It also can interfere with her mental status and stress levels. \n\tAfter talking about what women go through on a daily basis, it leaves me defeated. Women have to endure a lot of discussions and mistreatment from healthcare professionals, co-workers, and even from society. Sandel\u2019s book had allowed me to gain a deeper understanding more about how utilitarians and libertarians would think about abortion, contraceptives, healthcare, and maternity leave. It had also questioned how I felt about each topic, and how it can hurt or help society. I now understand these debates and conversations benefit many people, many get hurt or insulted, but there is always someone being benefitted. ",

        "text": "SOC 345 \nMid-Term Paper: American Families in 2035\n\tRecently, society has seen a shift in marriages or long-term relationships, and who the breadwinner is and who does the household chores. In the past, men were primarily the breadwinners, while women were housewives and would cook, clean, and care for the house. This dynamic has shifted going into the 21st century, and more women have entered the workforce. Some men have also shifted to stay-at-home dads, but the question of relationship equality still exists. Many old norms and traditions are still held up today, even though society is pushing towards an egalitarian relationship model. Many couples are also refraining from getting married or having kids. With all of these factors up in the air, it leaves many possibilities for a relationship to lean towards in the future. While these were some bigger factors, some smaller, seemingly insignificant influences also have a big impact. \n\tCurrently, we live in a society that is rapidly developing newer and more advanced models of technology. Technology is growing faster than society can keep up with, and it impacts society on large and small scales. Whether or not we realize it, technology has an extreme impact on families and their dynamics. I see this personally at my job every day. I work as a server in a local restaurant, and oftentimes when I go to greet a table, everyone at the table is on their phones. I\u2019m not judging by any means. I\u2019m on my phone more than I like, but throughout the entire dining experience, everyone is on their phones rather than talking. I believe that this is negatively affecting the family dynamic, and unless it is addressed, it may continue to harm families and cause many issues in the years to come. This is not just my opinion; sociological researchers are also concerned about this issue. Lee et al. (2022) examined how parental efficacy and methods, along with mobile device usage in children, negatively impact a child\u2019s relationship with technology and the family dynamic. The researchers' findings indicated that overconsumption and reliance on mobile devices are more likely to lead to negative outcomes. They mentioned that children holding mobile devices constantly will interfere with their daily lives, thus affecting their relationships and daily lives (Lee et al., 2022).  This has many implications for how families may look and operate in 2035. \nSmall things can have big implications on family dynamics, as seen with mobile devices. Things like quality time are extremely important to build strong and deep connections. Not having deep connections in relationships can lead to other tough situations, like Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). One ACE that is most commonly seen in families is substance use and abuse. According to Jabbari (2023), substance use and abuse can be affected by unhealthy family dynamics, especially in adolescents. Sometimes adolescents are looking for a way to escape or to regain a sense of control over their lives, which often manifests in them sneaking out or using substances. Jabbari (2023) also suggests that those in stressful family situations tend to gravitate towards unhealthy coping mechanisms, which impacts their health. Unhealthy family dynamics impact everyone in the family individually, as well as the whole unit. \n\tSo how does all of this play into the future dynamics of American families in 2035? There are a couple of different ways that families could go. One dynamic is a detached, unemotional, power struggle dynamic. This is the worst possible case scenario. This dynamic depicts a family that is not close, spends no time together, and is constantly fighting for attention. The parents would be fighting for equality in breadwinning, which would leave no room for quality time for their children. These children would grow up without a strong foundation, and if their parents suddenly tried to discipline them, then it would create an unhealthy dynamic. This dynamic would create the most strife and distance within the family. \n\tAnother dynamic would be a semi-balanced family dynamic. This dynamic would still have some strife and cause some issues between the parents themselves and the parents and children. In this dynamic, there is more of a balance with breadwinning and less competing. Both parents may work or only one, but they are working together to be financially stable. If only one person is working, it may cause some issues with providing for the family and the splitting of household chores. This may also cause strife with their children, especially if one parent is more present than the other. Even with some of the strife, this would be more optimal than the example in the previous paragraph. \n\tThe last dynamic depicts the most perfect dynamic in the ever-changing society that we live in. This would mean that no matter what each parent is doing, whether they are both at work or just one, they are both equally contributing to housework and taking care of their family. Their relationships with their children would be close and trusting. There would be no unhealthy dynamics like substance abuse or abuse. This would be the most optimal, but this seems to be harder to reach. \nIn conclusion, many factors impact a family\u2019s dynamic. There are large-scale and small-scale factors. All of these factors combined can have a multitude of effects. Ultimately, there is no way to predict a \u201ctypical American family in 2035.\u201d Society changes so much in ten years, and it\u2019s difficult to predict everything. Technology is changing constantly, and social media is impacting how we view society and how we should handle family dynamics. Families can be complicated, but I\u2019m hoping that the last scenario is what we are heading towards as a society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \nJabbari, B. (2023). Family dynamics.

        "text": "A Boy Broken Reflection\nFor starters, something that caught my attention straight away was a piece of the setting taking place in Pittsburgh.  I am from Pittsburgh and was born and raised in Burrell, about 30 minutes North East of the main city before moving to NC in 2015.  I was younger, about twelve, when I moved but I still remember all the memories I have of the city and the surrounding areas. It was almost eye opening to me because I never really experienced anyone who was struggling with mental health nor was I ever exposed to it in school being so young. Obviously, I was not born at the time, but most of my family members were and in a way it was almost like I didn\u2019t know mental health existed and when reading, it made me realize just how different everyone\u2019s lives are, even when living in the same area. \nChapter three actually became one of my favorite chapters for how honest and raw it felt while reading.  I really appreciate how you weren\u2019t afraid to share the truth about how you felt regarding Doug.  Specifically when you wrote \u201cWe were afraid of Doug.  Truly afraid\u201d on page 37.  It takes a lot of strength to write something negative about yourself because even if you don\u2019t feel that way in the present, it was true in the past.  \nAnother part of chapter three that made me feel this way was on page forty two when you mention the shame and denial you faced surrounding Doug.  How even when he moved back to Pittsburgh, you kept up the \u201cmasquerade\u201d and how it was actually easier for you.  Even when he was doing better, you still felt the need to embellish.  I feel like this is something people may judge for or think negatively on your part, however, I feel I would be in a similar position.  I wouldn\u2019t want to talk about how my child is struggling even if it was to someone I am close with.  It reminds me of when people would ask me about my dad. \n To make a very long story short, my dad passed away my senior year of high school in 2021 after a battle with ALS.  People would always ask me how he was doing, how I am doing or my mom, sister, etc. I would always just lie because it was hard to talk about.  I wasn\u2019t necessarily ashamed, but I didn\u2019t want people knowing how much my family was struggling at the time.  Overall, I thought chapter three was an incredible chapter and where the book fully got me locked in until the end.\nWhile reading the book, I actually began to annotate a lot of quotes or phrases that I really began to like.  For one, on page fifty three at the end of the chapter, you wrote \u201cthe ability of families to reach the point of acceptance offers the greatest potential for positive relationships to develop, and a positive life-course trajectory for their child.\u201d  I thought this was very well written and very transformative toward the emotion of the story.  When reading the story, naturally it will have a somber tone and be a tougher read, but once you write with your past self having acceptance and a will to learn, it transforms with a bit more light in a dark time.  I thought it was very well written.  \nAgain in the following chapters, specifically chapter five where you give some more academic information about caregiving and then pertaining it to your story in the following few chapters was very well detailed and laid out to me, showing how you always want the best for your son.  Being in class and talking about how support is such a vital factor when dealing with someone who is suffering from a mental disorder, it is amazing to read about it happening in real time.  The way you write about helping Doug with his miscellaneous finances like cigarettes or snacks but also teaching him some responsibility as well as navigating through his disease was a great example of the importance of support in a meaningful way.  \nI do also want to note that you do an incredible job at sharing what it is like to be exposed to schizophrenia.  Before reading this, I had never once been exposed to the true reality of the disease, minus fictionalized and dramatic movies.  From beginning to end of the book, I learned something new in almost every chapter and I feel a bit more prepared than I would be if I were to ever experience it with someone in my life.  I am aware that everyone is different and experiences things differently, however, even having a bit of knowledge as well as someone\u2019s first experience can be helpful.  \nReading about how Doug might have schizophrenia based on him having a concerning conversation to himself, to him opening up to you about Dave and Wendy, to eventually seeking help and getting on some medications.  People think that medications are a fix all when in reality they aren\u2019t and are just a support towards a variety of setbacks.  Reading about Doug\u2019s paranoia in his group home and then him essentially going missing was scary to see.  That feeling of helplessness would be gut wrenching, I could not imagine the fear.  I also like how you, these events were happening in real time for the first time.  Being able to read about how your past self also became exposed to a new symptom or struggle the same time I did was really interesting to me, but it also made me feel sad for you.  You had no idea what was going to come next and had little background with the disease.  I can say the same thing when reading about Melissa\u2019s struggles with her mental health too.  I have been exposed to depression in my life with my dad and my sister following his passing, but reading a bit about your experience shows how everyone battles things differently.  Reading about Melissa\u2019s death at the end of your book actually made me want to call my sister and just talk to her.  I know you aren\u2019t exactly sure what happened to your daughter, but it made me feel like I have taken my sister for granted at times.\nThere are so many aspects to your book and your journey that I could touch on, but I want to move on towards the end of the book which is just awful and heartbreaking to read.  When reading the last few chapters, before the epilogue, I was sad to hear about Doug falling slowly back into a hole that he was working to get out of.  However, it shows the true reality of life and the disease.  Him having issues with the police or having those inconsistencies you mention towards the end of chapter 8.  Within chapter nine, you bring up his psychological evaluation as well as the updates and progress logs.  I really appreciate you adding those in because it helps to better show how Doug was doing in this time.  \nReading about Doug gradually getting better and wanting to improve really flipped me into a happier tone, almost forgetting what was about to happen.  Anytime you have someone you care about, you always want what is best for them, so I can\u2019t imagine how you felt when writing the end. It's incredibly unfair how Doug\u2019s life ended.  All of his hard work to better himself, just to pass away at his highest point.  It's heart wrenching, but real and shows that life doesn\u2019t care about who deserves what.  I'm glad you included an epilogue because I feel those are where the most important or detrimental parts of a book take place in terms of the overall book.  I am glad you left your book on a more positive note, sharing the ways you saw Doug improving.  Whether it was the tidiness of his home or finding his plans for the future.  Finally, with you mentioning how all the wonderful memories are enough to keep you from feeling like you truly lost him.  I really enjoyed reading that and it made me a bit happier for you but still feeling sad, especially after reading about the loss of Melissa.  I couldn\u2019t imagine the pain of losing your second child.\nI am truly truly sorry for what you went through and the struggles and the long, hard journey you endured in the eight years surrounding Doug\u2019s disease and Melissa\u2019s own mental health struggles as well as the lasting effects their deaths have on you.  I also want to say thank you for sharing your journey.  You wrote such an incredible book and truthfully, it became one of my favorites for how truthful and vulnerable you write. . I plan on recommending it to anyone who I feel could benefit from your words.  Your journey really opened my eyes to how brutal life can be and how important mental health is.  I know at the end of the day, I am just a student in your class, but that's why I took this class.  I wanted to learn more about mental health and its importance.  Your book provided the best first hand account of this and I look forward to the rest of the course.",

        "text": "Mid-term Reflection Paper \nEarly in the book, Engelman explains the caregiver role to give the reader an understanding of what this role implies and what you may expect in that role. Throughout the book, Engelman uses his personal experience with Doug and how much it means to be a caregiver. He talks about how caregiving can be both rewarding and extremely stressful. He loves his son deeply, but there are times when he feels frustrated, angry, and overwhelmed. To give a reference to these feelings is when Doug called about being robbed because he gave someone money for a dime bag of pot, which, in return, he never got his pot. Engelman felt frustrated because he used his weekly allowance on pot but also having pot could have gotten him kicked out of the mental institution he was staying at. Later, he explains the feeling of guilt during those frustrating situations because he wanted the best for Doug so that one day he could reach the 10% of schizophrenic individuals who become fully independent. These frustrating moments throughout Engelman\u2019s story reminded me of how my dad gets frustrated with my grandfather because he hides his TV remote and money and forgets where he puts them, so he assumes someone stole his items. When my dad tries to help, my grandfather won\u2019t tell him much and gets agitated and hangs up the phone. This is very tolling on my dad because he has a full-time job and a family to provide for while having to deal with these frustrating situations over the phone. My grandfather stays in Ohio while we live in North Carolina, but luckily my dad\u2019s sister lives up there, so he can coordinate with her when he needs additional help. Like Engelman, when he would receive phone calls from Doug, I see it within my dad that same expression of whether it\u2019s good news or another problem to solve.\nEngelman and his wife Wendy started reading into schizophrenia to get a better understanding on how to approach it and give Doug a fighting chance. As Engelman and his son are both at ground zero with trying to figure out how to approach this Engelman learns how to talk with Doug without upsetting him but also pushing the limits because Doug kept everything close with what was going on like his hallucinations of Wendy being in the back seat of the car when they were going to McDonalds for breakfast. That really connects with what I\u2019ve seen between my dad and my grandfather. When my grandfather calls in a confused or angry state, my dad tries to calm him down, but sometimes he loses patience. I have also seen it in person once when we were visiting him because while in his room he was talking about some man that gets into fights with and out of nowhere, he goes\u201d he is standing right there\u201d but there was no one there. Just like Engelman with Doug my dad had to figure out how to approach in which in this situation my dad moved the door which the shadow from the light was gone and my grandfather then replied, \u201che\u2019s gone, where did he go\u201d. It was hard to see that and explain what is going on. \nThroughout this book Engelman helped me see how caregiving changes people. It forces them to be patient, resourceful, and resilient. Traveling through this rough journey with his son Engelman became more understanding and reflective. He learned to see the world differently by noticing how society treats people with mental disorders, and how families are often left to carry such a burden alone. Being able to personally connect to Engelmans story has made me realize how my dad\u2019s life has changed since becoming the primary caregiver of my grandfather. He has become more patient but also compassionate not just toward my grandfather but others as well. It has also taught me a lesson that caregiving isn\u2019t just about taking care of someone but also learning to love them through their tough times.  \nThe most heartbreaking part of Engelman\u2019s story was the passing of Doug in a car accident, but something that I was truly saddened by was when Engelman and Wendy went to Doug\u2019s apartment after the funeral, where they saw nothing but positive things. Doug\u2019s apartment was organized and clean, and he had a planner on his nightstand in which Engelman told him it would be helpful to have. Also, in that planner, Doug had a reminder to call the Pittsburgh admission office because he had gotten to a point where he was ready to go back to college. When Engelman and his wife, Wendy, also saw this in Doug\u2019s apartment, it showed how much progress Doug had made and that he was on the right track to be a part of the 10% of schizophrenia patients who go back to being fully independent.\nDespite the unimaginable grief, Engelman finds a new purpose by going back to college, where he wanted to learn how to be an author to write Doug's story, but later changed his major to study sociology, from the advice of a professor he had. This change made it possible for Engelman to help others understand mental illness, showing the incredible strength and resilience. After reading A Boy Broken and having Engelman as my sociology of mental disorders professor, it gives me a new understanding of the class and mental disorders. It has shown me that healing can come from sharing our pain; it creates connection, understanding, and comfort for others in need.",

        "text": "SOC 345\n15 October 2025\nThe Future of Applying Ideological Equality in America\n\tOver the course of the past century America has shifted from a relatively homogeneous culture placing priority on assimilation and the nuclear family to a more diverse society defined by stratified social identities. Towards the end of the civil rights movement the codified laws which would be created in the name of forcing an end to segregation would see many positive outcomes but in practice some mandates have often fallen short due to inconsistent enforcement and uneven social integration. To contrast, the most homogeneous societies of the world are also the ones with the best success of welfare implementation, as social consensus and shared norms can simplify policy coordination. In the United States, however, the ongoing struggle to balance cultural diversity with cohesive national identity has placed increased pressure on traditional family structures. This family structure shift stems from the struggles of maintaining a non-homogenous national identity and prospects of the shape this could take tend to form around two schools of thought.\n\tFirstly, the once normative traditional American family with a husband, wife, and kids has now become the counterculture and can be predicted to see a return due to the weakness of maintaining collective values in an increasingly diverse society. Most trends fluctuate so seeing a return to form based on strong family bonds free of ambiguity is a viable option. Many today believe rapid social changes have progressed too forcibly due to the application of political agendas on social thought instead of organic cultural evolution. Current debates over family values, gender roles, and cultural identity have been often too politicized. This changes what would otherwise be normative social adaptations into an ideological battleground. This politicization risks obscuring genuine discussions about how best to gauge a balance between equality, stability, and personal freedom within modern family life.\nThe crux of the issue can be understood when looking at the codified laws being proposed to combat inequality in the workplace and household. The ultimate logic for dictating a replacement of social norms is not clearly defined in many instances allowing for perpetual violations of the ultimate cause being fought for. This issue is not new as various civil rights laws like the Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 suffer from the same issue of legal ambiguity. One good example of modern equality legislation passed in the UK in recent years. Laws like the Equality Act of 2010 (UK) often leave ambiguous explanations on how it intends to change social norms. The ultimate change achieved by these types of legislation are inherently weak because even though it defines new standards to meet, things like failing to define sexual orientation clearly end up not enshrining the social leap it was intended to. This applies to the US because there was intent on implementing an adapted version which never came to fruition. \nThe sociological thinker Durkheim comes to mind when defining the problems of practicing ambiguous policies. To quote Sociology of Law by Milovanovic on Durkheim social philosophy, he states \u201cDurkheim assumes that society, left to itself, will evolve from the traditional to the complex form,\u201d existing in \u201ca state of equilibrium.\u201d However, \u201cwhen these adjustments do not take place,\u201d he notes, \u201ca state Durkheim referred to as anomie\u201d emerges, an idea \u201cmany criminologists embed or assume in their explanation of crime.\u201d (Milovanovic 2022, p.67) This state of anomie (normlessness) can be seen much more vividly than ever before, perhaps resulting in accepted application of normlessness as the norm. Something as simple as the man paying on the first date or asking another on a date is being actively torn down making what was already a difficult hurdle for people to make now being thrown into question; a socially accepted procedure for centuries. This state of anomie, or normlessness, according to Durkheim\u2019s philosophy, is also linked to suicide. In a time when the application of equitable laws is at an all-time high, this may correlate with rising male suicide rates from 18.1 per 100,000 in 1968 to 22.8 per 100,000 in 2023, an increase of 26% (National Institute of Mental Health) potentially reflecting a displacement of their societal roles.\nTo understand the place that counter-traditional relational ideologies will take in the coming years you need to first break down the aspects these groups use to define themselves. The future of gay couples in America is undoubtedly an important one and many social thinkers believe these social advancements are being normalized much like racial integration once was. There are many debates within LGBTQ+ movements about how internal representation and behavior have influenced public perceptions, sometimes hindering support. There is no better way to tear down a movement than to evoke societal reactions to perceived displays of misconduct. The civil rights activists did a very good job at showing how strongly spoken they were to the public and everything from the way they dressed to the way they organized and conducted themselves saw them winning social acceptance, changing predominant beliefs. Homosexuality being sexual in nature has seen problems of acceptance due to displays of social misconduct and demands of image reorientation are needed in order to spark lasting transformative change. Recognizing how image and perception influence public acceptance is essential as these factors directly impact whether policies aimed at family equality achieve genuine integration or remain symbolically progressive.\nAlong the more contemporary lines of reform, if Europe is to be used as a model for America in the coming years there are plenty of positive and negative takeaways to understand before new laws become formalized. Positive takeaways include laws like Norway's Paid Parental Leave and \u201cUse-It-or-Lose-It\u201d quotas which sees all parents being entitled to paid leave even reserving a portion for fathers. This is a good example because not only does it shift workplace norms but it also helps the parents fulfil their family duties at home. One other example would be Germany's Anti-Discrimination Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG) which nets some benefits like providing a clear legal framework for victims of workplace discriminatory practices and a focus on encouraging proactive HR policies. The categorizations within this remedy based approach helps reduce confusion in interpretation allowing for clear paths for enforcement. \nRegarding examples not to follow France\u2019s Gender Parity in Politics Law (2000) and EU\u2019s Directive on Work-Life Balance (2019) provide a good contrast. With France\u2019s law it explains a requirement for political parties to present 50% female, 50% male candidate nomination. Results here are thoroughly superficial as the issue of political representation among women in France, even though statistically improved, still lacks a qualitative effect with women being placed in local non-competitive districts for party compliance purposes. The EU directive on work life balance sees a different set of issues. It is designed to encourage flexible working arrangements and parental leave across EU states but because it is another EU law designed to be applied in countries with completely different internal interests application and enforcement suffer putting into question the integrity of the law\u2019s legitimization. The United States can learn from this aspect especially in a time where federal legal precedent is used to apply to states which fail to share social values of other states. Laws are always best applied at the state level first and foremost because they\u2019re more likely to reflect the communities interests. When it comes to family representation nothing could be farther away than a federal mandate.\nThe failure of social legislation to alleviate pressures on families forces new generations to adapt resulting in individualized social nets to form at an advanced rate. While this can be economically beneficial by eliminating financial dependence on others, phenomena like the single mother epidemic and the rise of less conventional blended families present their own instabilities. It would be a disservice of governance to supplement these situations without first addressing the systemic roots of unideal living situations. True reform requires legislation that strengthens the social foundations of family life. This can be achieved by focussing on wage inequality, affordable childcare, and accessible housing (the Blackrock problem) rather than policies that merely treat the symptoms of deeper structural imbalance. Without this shift, future generations will continue to bear the private costs of public inaction, mistaking adaptation for progress. Social change is slow so in the year 2035 the differences from 2025 are going to be negligible even if federal mandates are created today the process of trickling into the social consciousness will not be completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nGuney, G., Lee, PH., Davies, D.

        "text": "Looking to the future of society based on what is seen now, what would a typical family in 2035 look like?  To begin, let's look at where society is now. First, let's think about society's views on family and marriage. Marriage right now is seen as a goal for most. It is a goal that for some is seen as attainable, others it is seen as something that isn\u2019t. For most, marriage means that they are marrying and then co-habituating with someone. Though this isn\u2019t always the case. Many are leaning towards co-habitation before marriage, and this is leading to a question of is marriage as valued as it once was? The answer is complicated. Given this economic state, seeing marriage as a goal is common, but seeing it as attainable is not. Saving for the cost of what it takes to be married with a \u201cproper\u201d wedding and having that be the measure of that goal to many seems like it isn\u2019t worth doing. This is why a rise in co-habitation and living together before being married and longer engagements etc. is becoming more common. This is because marriage is shifting away from being seen as a \u201cstatus\u201d symbol to be achieved for only monetary value. (Coontz, 2015) We are seeing people\u2019s marriage values shift to being focused on love and what each can bring into the shared relationship. (Coontz, 2005) This is seen especially between classes and particularly between the upper to middle and the lower class. The lower class cannot view marriage with a lens of status increase since they are not able to have financial stability enough to be able to offer or add increasing monetary value to each other. (Coontz, 2015)\n\n\nThis brings the next point forward of the workforce and how that can relate to families and their family planning, childcare, earnings, etc. The workforce influences families in a major way. First is the income that couples receive with and without children. Without having children, there is a gender pay gap that was slowly closing. However, it has begun to widen again. It also increases when children are brought into families as well with fatherhood bonuses being given to them to provide further for the family, versus penalties mothers face when they need to take time off after giving birth, or to care for their children etc. (Budig, 2014) So, with earnings factored into a couple's marriage and family this affects their want to have children and how they do their family planning and how many kids that they may want to have. This affects the type of care and the amount that these parents can do for their children. Which ties back into family structures and the impact being a working parent has on them. Because of the workforce\u2019s impact parents are having to decide how to best provide care for children, this means deciding if one of them will be working whilst the other stays home, if both will be working, if they each will do both which would mean each is working and caring parttime. If one parent stays at home it is most likely assumed to be the mom, which can come with its own issues of mom doing more labor at home and feeling overworked and that labor not being recognized, and if it is the father at home, there is a huge stigma that they only sit around and do not care properly for their child. If they both choose to work, there could be the issue of the mom having to deal with the \u201csecond shift.\u201d Meaning she must come home from her nine to five job and then come do household chores and childcare etc. on her own. (Hochschild & Machung, 1989) Which causes an imbalance of how much each parent contributes to the home. If they both decide they want to try and do both in equal measure, they often will find that they are always losing out on either free time at home catching up on things or find that they must be absent from work often. It is hard to find a balance between doing both care and working.  (Hochschild & Machung, 1989)\n\nThis brings back our original question based on what is seen now: what might the typical family in 2035 look like? Based on what has been seen It is safe to say that our typical family structure still will likely look like a nuclear one. It is safe to try and predict that as we see that other family structures are struggling to become made or are thought of as normative. Two parents and their children are likely still going to be the normative family, if they choose to have any. However, it may not hold the traditional gender roles or traditional differential sex parent make up.  I think we are growing more acceptive of LGBTQ parents having children and still seeing that as a family. However, things such as polyamorous families and couples, kinship and village networks, etc. are still not seen as proper families or the norm. It is likely there will be a push towards trying to provide and be equally involved in relationships, the household, and parenting. What that looks like will likely be different for each family like how it does now. The way that this will likely be done is by investing greater effort into finding balance within work and personal life and time as we are seeing a trend now of that. \n\n\nIn conclusion, based on the trends we are seeing now, even though it may be hard to make airtight predictions due to different influences and how fast we can see trends ebb and flow based on them, it is safe to assume within the next ten years we can expect more continued growth and change within these different areas. Particularly in the areas of what and who we consider a family, gender roles in marriage and families, childcare, how parents respond to the work force, etc. These changes, although they may not be big, will hopefully be continuing a track of growth that we are seeing and not a regression of where trends are now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCITATIONS: \nCoontz, S.

        "text": "Isabella Freund\nSOC-250-001\n17 September 2025\nReflection One\n\tMichael Joseph Sandel is a very accomplished and acclaimed American political philosopher and professor at Harvard University. Michael Joseph Sandel is very well known for his internationally bestselling book called \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d Throughout this book, Michael Joseph Sandel expands on his ideologies about morals, ethics, laws, and politics. He connects real-world events to different theories of justice, like utilitarianism and libertarianism, as well as different philosophers' ideas, such as Kant, Aristotle, and Rawls. Michael Joseph Sandel's book serves as a clear, engaging, and well-written piece of literature that challenges readers to reflect on their own beliefs and moral compasses. Michael Sandel's book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do\u201d also laid the foundation for a lifelong career dedicated to involving the public in moral, ethical, and civil discussions. \n\tIn Michael Joseph Sandel\u2019s book \u201cJustice: What\u2019s the Right Thing to Do?\u201d, he states that there are three approaches to justice. A society distributes different things we prize, including income and wealth, duties and responsibilities, powers and opportunities, and offices and honors. A society that is just distributes these things fairly and equitably, giving each individual his or her due. Michael Sandel states, however, \u201cThe hard questions begin when we ask what people are due, and why\u201d (pg. 17). The first idea of justice is maximizing welfare. Maximizing welfare is centered around the ideas of promoting prosperity, improving our standard of living, and producing the overall greatest good for a society. Michael Sandel further explains this ideology by connecting it to the philosophical approach of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of the greater good. If an action promotes the greatest happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people, then it is right. Individuals who follow the utilitarianism approach often evaluate their actions by asking themselves Does it improve the overall quality of life and welfare? While utilitarianism sounds simple enough, it also has its negatives that come along with it. Utilitarianism can overlook individual rights and justify acts of injustice as long as they result in a greater good for a majority of people. While I do personally think that utilitarianism can be an effective tool for maximizing happiness and welfare, I do think it has a few drawbacks that raise some ethical and moral concerns. \n\tThe second approach links justice to freedom. In this section of Michael Joseph Sandel's book, he explains that a wide range of theories emphasize respect for individual rights and decisions. Sandel states that \u201cThe idea that justice means respecting freedom and individual rights is at least as familiar in contemporary politics as the utilitarian idea of maximizing welfare.\u201d For example, the U.S. Bill of Rights sets out certain liberties\u2014including rights to freedom of speech and religious liberty\u2014that even majorities may not violate. And around the world, the idea that justice means respecting certain universal human rights is increasingly embraced (in theory, if not always in practice). (pg. 19). This approach is broad and uses both libertarian and egalitarian views. On one side, Sandel states that libertarians argue \u201cthat justice consists in respecting and upholding the voluntary choices made by consenting adults\u201d (pg. 19), while egalitarians argue that \u201cunfettered markets are neither just nor free. In their view, justice requires policies that remedy social and economic disadvantages and give everyone a fair chance at success\u201d (pg. 19). Both the libertarian and egalitarian arguments linking justice to freedom have strong points as well as limitations. I personally think that I agree more with the egalitarian argument. I think that in order for everyone to truly be free, we need to address the more deeply rooted structural inequalities and biases, and social injustices that are among us. I believe that justice is truly served when everyone has equal access to different opportunities and chances at success. \n\tIn the third approach, Michael Joseph Sandel connects justice to virtue and the good life. This approach highlights the idea that justice isn\u2019t only about the outcomes but also about promoting certain moral values and ethics within a society. Sandel goes on to explain that different moral and religious ideologies have shaped political movements and arguments for decades. One example of this is Martin Luther King Jr., who drew his visions and ideas of what justice looks like from different moral and religious perspectives. The approach that connects justice to virtue and the good life shows us that debates and different opinions about what justice is are often intertwined with the different values a society chooses to uphold. \n\tAll three of Michael Joseph Sandel's approaches to justice\u2014maximizing welfare, linking justice to freedom, and connecting justice to virtue\u2014show just how complex it is to determine what justice really is and what it looks like. Sandals' explanations of the three approaches to justice really make me think about the deeper values and individual morals that shape our choices and decisions. Everyone has a different perspective on what justice should look like, and these different approaches encourage us to think about what justice is to us. Sandel provides us with an example of how our moral reasoning leads us to the decisions we make. In the example of The Runaway Trolley, Sandel states that \u201cSuppose you are the driver of a trolley car hurtling down the track at sixty miles an hour. Up ahead, you see five workers standing on the track, tools in hand. You try to stop, but you can\u2019t. The brakes don\u2019t work. Suddenly, you notice a side track off to the right. There is a worker on that track, too, but only one. You realize that you can turn the trolley car onto the side track, killing the one worker but sparing the five. Now consider another version where you are an onlooker. The trolley is about to crash into the five workers. You feel helpless to avert this disaster\u2014until you notice, standing next to you on the bridge, a very heavy man. You could push him off the bridge, onto the track, into the path of the oncoming trolley. He would die, but the five workers would be saved\u201d (pg. 20). I found the example of the runaway trolley to be very interesting because it truly does raise a moral and ethical puzzle. Individuals will have different ideas on what choice is correct, and this example goes to show that everyone has different moral principles, dilemmas, and perspectives on what is considered right and wrong. \n\tMichael Joseph Sandel shows us how different individuals face different moral dilemmas, which further reveal the way people view topics \u201cabout right and wrong, justice and injustice. Some people favor abortion rights, and others consider abortion to be murder. Some believe fairness requires taxing the rich to help the poor, while others believe it is unfair to tax away money people have earned through their own efforts. Some defend affirmative action in college admissions as a way of righting past wrongs, whereas others consider it an unfair form of reverse discrimination against people who deserve admission on their merits. Some people reject the torture of terror suspects as a moral abomination unworthy of a free society, while others defend it as a last resort to prevent a terrorist attack\u201d (pg. 27). While it may seem like our moral convictions are fixed by our upbringing or faith, I believe that our morals can change. Throughout our lifetimes, we are faced with different situations that challenge our personal principles and morals. Sandel states that in order for justice to be discovered, different debates, dialogues, and ideologies must be had, and sometimes our minds can be changed. Throughout the book, Sandel brings up the different perspectives of Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls to encourage us to further examine our own morals and to figure out why we think the way we do. \n\tImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) offers us one of the most powerful accounts of duties and rights. Kant\u2019s account depends on the ideology that we are rational beings worthy of dignity and respect. Kant\u2019s groundwork relates to the question of \u201cWhat is the supreme principle of morality?\u201d and in the course of answering that question, it addresses another hugely important one: \u201cWhat is freedom?\u201d (pg. 104). Kant's opinion on freedom challenges our understanding of morality because he believes that true freedom is acting according to the principles we have given ourselves. Kant rejects utilitarianism because he believes that it leaves rights vulnerable, and just because something benefits the majority doesn't make it morally right. Kant also believes that every individual deserves respect because they are rational beings capable of reason and making choices. Kant also believes that freedom is our obedience to impulses that we don\u2019t get to choose. To act freely is to act autonomously according to the moral laws we give ourselves. I do personally have some critiques of Kant\u2019s philosophy. I believe that his ideology is almost too rigid at times. Kant believes that moral rules are absolute, especially when it comes to lying. I personally believe that lying is ok in some instances. One personal example of where I believe that it was ok for me to lie was when I was babysitting. The little girl and I were painting together, and she asked me if her painting she made of her and her parents was good (it was not). I obviously lied and said yes because why would you tell a little girl that her painting was not the best? I believe that in this situation, it was ok for me to lie in order to spare the little girl's feelings. While Kant would argue that all lying undermines morality, I believe that in some instances lying is ok. Morality requires flexibility, context, and empathy. \n\tSandel's book on justice provides us with different philosophical ideologies and perspectives that we can use to help us face our problems today. He compares different views on what justice is, like libertarianism and egalitarianism, and draws on different philosophical perspectives, like Immanuel Kant's. I found Kant\u2019s perspective on morality and freedom to be quite interesting, but also too strict at times. All these different ideologies and perspectives make me really think about what justice and morality are and should look like in our daily lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference:\nSandel, M.

        "text": "As someone who had not really been informed about schizophrenia before, only through maybe a few films, I found this book insightful. I was able to gather information that I will be able to take with me through the rest of my life. As I never know what may happen in my life, I can eventually be in close relation with someone who has schizophrenia, and I now have a better understanding of it. Through the way the author told the story, you can see his true determination to understand his son and his son\u2019s diagnosis, as well as making sure his treatment plan was good. If ever I were to have this issue, I know that I can refer to this book to have a more informative way to navigate it. The reading also helped me understand how much marijuana and alcohol can affect individuals with schizophrenia. As I knew it could affect schizophrenic individuals trying to deal with their mental disorder, I did not necessarily understand how hard it could be not to participate in these situations. Most young adults are getting the first chance to experiment with these things, and schizophrenic individuals are just expected not to participate. It can be another isolating factor whenever socializing as well especially at parties. \nHaving a passion for turning your work into something meaningful is something that the author and I have in common. I have had experiences in my life that have impacted me so deeply that it has moved me to want to make a change. Similar to the author, whenever his son passed, he felt the need to one day share his story. I have a story to tell of my own, and reading this book has reignited something within myself. I lost my brother in 2020 and my dad in 2021, and there is so much I went through that I can use to help others in the future. When the author spoke about going to college when he was an older adult and discovering a purpose for something, it helped me reassure myself that I am on the right path. The author\u2019s path did not happen overnight and eventually he was able to put into words what he wanted to say. I feel many of the things I struggle with in my own life would be able to be let go if I could write and be as openly honest as the author. As I have grown into the young lady I am today, I am still learning the right words I need to put together to tell my story. The author\u2019s dedication made me want to continue to pursue my education and try harder to be better. My father was killed, and when my brother died, I kind of fell apart. The author mentioned speaking to a priest who told him to basically stop playing victim, because he did not die, and I feel, after reading that, I have to switch up my own mentality a little bit. \nOverall, the story, \u201cA Boy Broken\u201d, is informative for all and not just people dealing with family members who are experiencing schizophrenia. It tells a complex story of family and how family dynamics can function when there are mental disorders present. To be able to read something so personal from someone makes me respect their ability to even be brave enough to do that. We face a lot of judgment in life, and being able to tell your story truthfully for the sake of others is so brave. To tell such personal details of my life can be scary, but being able to stand in what you know is the truth can be more powerful than anything.  In the future, as I grow and maybe have a family one day of my own, if they ever have to face certain challenges, I will be able to approach them differently than I did before because of reading this book. We as a society indeed have a long way to go before mental disorders are not stigmatized anymore, but being honest about an experience can help other people within their own or someone in their family. Hearing personal stories from individuals and their experiences, I feel, is one of the best ways to really learn and understand. Inevitably, to be able to change societal standards and ideas surrounding mental disorders will take a lot of effort, and  I feel like we are going to continue to backslide on any of the progress that we may have had recently. \n",

What used to be common in the 40s and 50s is much different from what we see today, or is it? The traditional nuclear family has expanded and can seem somewhat unfamiliar, but when taking a closer look, it appears that society\u2019s ideas have not ventured as far as we think. While stigmatizations have changed quite a bit, society still tends to be set in what could be considered traditional.\nMarriage and Divorce Rates\nThe stigma surrounding divorce has subsided greatly compared to what it was before World War II. \tSheela Kennedy and Steven Ruggles (2014) share that individuals who are forty or older tend to have higher divorce rates, especially after World War II. This can be attributed to the fact that divorce was no longer highly stigmatized, but also the legality of divorce changed significantly (Kennedy & Ruggles, 2014). We can see during this time that women were allowed to enter the workforce at a much higher rate than before. This access to jobs meant access to money, which meant that a woman could have financial freedom. Women now had access to leave their husbands and be financially stable on their own terms. \nWe have seen a decline in divorce rates among women who are age twenty-five or younger (Kennedy & Ruggles, 2014). This decline can be associated with the lack of marriage in the first place. Kennedy and Ruggles (2014) mention that in 2008, over forty percent of the population was not married by the time they turned thirty. A lot of this has to do with individuals being more selective in their partners compared to the past. Couples before World War II got married to fulfill societal roles, whereas now, we see couples dating or getting married to fulfill individual goals. \nI believe that divorce rates could swing either way. In one instance, I think that religion is becoming increasingly popular again. In the event that this popularity continues to increase, we could see an increase in traditional marriages once again, with a lower divorce rate. We may also see a decrease in divorce rates because couples are simply not getting married. Cohabitation is common and is beginning to possess the same rights as couples who are married. In this instance, I think we will see that marriage becomes less important, and therefore, divorce rates would decline. In another scenario, I could see divorce rates rising. You rarely see people being stigmatized for divorce; instead, it is applauded for the fact that you are strong enough to remove yourself from whatever situation it may be. There is a lot more freedom when it comes to divorce in the fact that a woman or a man can initiate a divorce. With those ideas in mind, I can see divorce rates increasing. Honestly, there is no perfect answer for how that will change in ten years. It could be exactly what it is today, or it can change completely.\nTraditional Nuclear Families: Stay away or make a comeback?\nWe have seen a big shift away from traditional nuclear families. Society is much more open to cohabitation, same-sex marriages, and single parents. Cohabitation has increased drastically since World War II. We are now seeing that marriages typically begin with cohabitation instead of living separately until marriage (Smock, 2000). I have noticed an increase in cohabitation among college students living with significant others. Cohabitation has become very similar to marriage, which in turn makes it \u201cgood enough\u201d for those who aren\u2019t quite ready for the responsibilities that come with marriage. In 2035, I believe that cohabitation will become the norm for people. I almost want to say that the number of people cohabitating will be much greater than those who are actually married.\nAnother nontraditional family type is same-sex couples. In 2011, only seven states in America legally allowed same-sex marriages (Chamie & Mirkin, 2011). This has since changed with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in 2015 that legalized same-sex marriages in all fifty states. Previously, same-sex marriage was not only legally unavailable, but there was a great deal of stigma that came with it. Now, we see much more acceptance; however, there are certainly opposing groups that do not believe in same-sex marriage and do not believe it should be legal. I think that if we continue the path we are currently on, same-sex marriage will remain legal and most likely continue to hold similar statistics as it does now. With that being said, I still firmly believe that we will have a group of people who will continue to oppose the allowance of same-sex marriages. \nWhile these rates are increasing, we also see an increase in single parents, specifically single mothers. Single parents were not common prior to World War II, as families were trying to fulfill societal roles. Now, we see an increase in divorces or never-married couples because individuals are more likely to prioritize themselves. With these separation rates, it is more likely that a child will be under the care of a single parent. Mothers tend to get custody of the children, whether that be court-ordered or because the father does not put in the same effort. This, of course, can go both ways. In 1984, 25.7% of families were single-family households, accounting for one-fourth of the population (Hanson & Sporakowski, 1986). In the college age group, it is common for a teen pregnancy to occur and the mother to be the primary caregiver. Through my own experience, I have noticed that the majority of my friends who live with single parents live with their mothers. I do not see this changing a whole lot in the next ten years. We have normalized divorce, which increases the number of single-parent households. I will not say that the number of single-parent households will increase, but I do think that it will continue to stay at a similar level compared to what it is now. \nSo, what will the world be like in ten years?\nOverall, I think that the structure of families will continue the path that they are on now. We will continue to see divorce rates increase or plateau because of how society has normalized it. An increase in divorce rates can be a leading cause for single-parent families. I also think that we will continue to see a rise in same-sex marriages. Since it has become legal, we have seen an increase. I do think that this will continue as it becomes less stigmatized and more normalized. \nI don\u2019t see us reverting to past traditions and normalizing marriages as something to satisfy societal roles. We have opened the gates by allowing women in the workforce and pushing towards egalitarian roles. I believe that egalitarianism will become the most popular format for families moving forward. I think certain things need to be fixed to achieve an egalitarian society, but if we continue to push, we might get there. Things like fixing the wage gap, finding better solutions to childcare, and allowing Americans to have a better work-life balance. It is very prevalent that egalitarian relationships are subjective, and the definition of egalitarianism is dependent on the couple. While we will never know what the future will bring, I predict that these could be some of the possible outcomes. Of course, we see rapid changes in history, meaning we have the potential to experience these norms changing without having any insight currently. \n\n\n\nReferences\nChamie, J., & Mirkin, B. (2011).
