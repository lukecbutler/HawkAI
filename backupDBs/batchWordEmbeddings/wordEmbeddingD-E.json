Each sociologist focuses on a different area of study and are working in a different time period, which means that there are many different ways to look at sociological concepts. In addition, as time passes, new problems and ideas arise that lead to new ways to understand sociology and our society today. As a result, different sociologists will have some similar, but also some differing views and explanations for different aspects of sociology. Yuval Noah Harari, for example, will have some similar and different ideas compared to past sociologists such as \u00c9mile Durkheim and George Mead. \n\tYuval Noah Harari is an Israeli historian and philosopher, and the author of the book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. In this book, he addresses our current global climate and looks at big questions faced by today\u2019s society. He thinks about these pressing questions and then addresses them throughout the book. Many of the topics addressed in his book relate to concepts that have been discussed by sociologists. One of the points that Harari argues in his book is that religion is completely irrelevant to policy and technical problems and should not be used to solve them. The examples that he provides for these problems include ideas such as what measures governments should take and how farmers should deal with droughts. In the past, religion was consistently used to solve these problems because people didn\u2019t have the same knowledge that we have today. Given what we now know with modern science and technology, religion would have no way to help solve these problems, and so it should be left out completely. However, Harari states that religion is relevant for problems surrounding identity, and that it contributes to a big part of the problem rather than the solution. Identity problems include things like what we should care about and how we should feel about certain topics. Harari explains how all religious traditions unite the people who follow and distinguishes them from the other people around them that don\u2019t follow the same religion. Religion is what provides people with a template for how they should live their lives and what they should believe in, which creates one group with the same views. He also explains how some religions encourage more kindness and charitability, while others fill the world with more ugliness and cruelty. He is demonstrating how the unity created through religion can be harmful rather than beneficial.\n\t\u00c9mile Durkheim was a French sociologist who studied religion and how it influences our social interactions. Durkheim believed that religion was important to study and understand because he thought that all fundamental categories of thought and science have religious roots. This meant he believed that religion was the backbone for thinking and provided a sort of template for how science and thought were created. He also believed that all great institutions were born in religion. Religion is what helped form our modern institutions and provide them with the foundation to grow into what they are today. In addition, Durkheim believed that religion created a collective representation and consciousness among those who practiced a similar religion. The collective consciousness is the set of common ideas or beliefs held by a certain group. These beliefs that are the same among the whole group act to unify the group. It also works to shape the individual\u2019s perspective on how they should live their life. It guides what someone perceives as meaningful, dangerous, good, or evil. A collective representation is a symbol, artifact, or narrative that articulates and embodies the collective beliefs, sentiments, and values of a certain group. This includes examples such as the idea of giving at Christmas, a cross, or wedding rings. The collective representation is the symbol or identifying factor of the collective consciousness. Durkheim believes that society is then created through the collective conscious. We work together as a group to collectively produce a shared sense of reality and morals. In Durkheim\u2019s mind, religion is a crucial part of how society is created and run. \n\tHarari and Durkheim both argue that religion is an important aspect for uniting people and creating a common belief system. However, their differences are evident in whether they believe this collective consciousness is beneficial or harmful to society. Durkheim believes that having a collective consciousness is important in creating a cohesive society. He argues that it is essential to have similar beliefs and values so that you have a way to relate to those around you. The collective consciousness is what allows us to form our society. He also believed that religion was important in creating our modern institutions and ways of thinking, and that without it, we wouldn\u2019t have modern science or thinking. On the other hand, Harari is arguing that this collective consciousness created from religion often goes too far and creates more problems than solutions. Harari believes that when religion becomes involved, there are strong divisions created between individuals as well as groups. Because religion creates such strong beliefs, it often means that the two opposing groups have even stronger divisions. Each person is expected to act exactly how their religion says they should, and no one should sway from this path. This can lead to problems with the two groups working together or finding ways to keep the peace. When neither group is willing to compromise or hear the other groups perspective, a solution will never be reached. In addition, Harari explains how problems can arise when our identity clumps together beyond our sense of experience. \n\tGeorge Mead was another sociologist who had ideas that related to Harari\u2019s. Mead worked to develop an idea of how the human self arises. He believed that the self is experienced through internal dialogue between the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cme\u201d. The \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cme\u201d are both cognitive elements of the mind, but they have different influences. The \u201cI\u201d is the subjective reaction of the mind to stimuli in the environment and comes from emotional responses or actions. It is almost like your reflex or instincts in response to some event. The \u201cme\u201d is the objective evaluation of the \u201cI\u201d reactions and comes from what has been learned about the particular social setting. Mead also believed that the self is experienced indirectly but completely, while the body is experienced directly but incompletely. When we put these factors together, we have a full, conscious experience of our self. We are reacting to our environment and then evaluating that reaction. Mead believed that this conscious experience was important for humans to understand. It is important that we are fully aware of our \u201cself\u201d and the different pieces that influence our self. \n\tIn addition to the role of religion in society, another issue Harari addresses in his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is the dangers of algorithms and technology in our society. He argues that technology will eventually take over jobs that are currently occupied by humans. Eventually, machines and technology will be able to complete almost all of the jobs that humans are responsible for. This means that many people will be out of jobs and will have to train for new, higher-level jobs that technology will not yet be capable of completing. Another major problem that arises through the development of technology is that it will eventually be able to know you better than you know yourself. Once technology understands us better than we understand ourselves, it will be able to monitor and manipulate our feelings. One example Harari provides for this is how companies will be able to use data and technology to target ads specifically towards you. Your preferences will be used to target ads to you in order to help the companies make the maximum profit. Technology takes away our conscious experiences, and simply replaces it with artificial intelligence. Harari stresses that there is a difference between consciousness and intelligence, and it is important that we continue to have conscious experiences. \n\tBoth Mead and Harari have a similar view in how it is important to have an overall conscious experience. Mead believed that it was important to have a conscious experience of the self through the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cme\u201d. He argued that in order to fully experience something, all of the different aspects of your \u201cself\u201d had to interact and work together. Understanding the different influences on your overall experience is crucial in having a conscious experience. Similarly, Harari argues how it is important to maintain a conscious experience rather than simply relying on artificial intelligence. Technology can take over our lives and know us better than we know ourselves, but it cannot create a conscious experience. Technology simply has intelligence while humans are the only ones capable of having a true conscious experience. Therefore, Harari is stressing the importance of preventing technology from taking over every aspect of our lives. Consciousness is too important to humans to let technology take it over. \n\tThere are many concepts in sociology that remain consistent over time, while others seem to change. As our society grows and develops, new problems will arise that will lead to new concepts and understandings to be created. This means that while some sociologists and historians will have similar views, there will be times when they disagree or have ideas that are inconsistent with one another. However, this does not mean that one view is necessarily better than another. Each sociologist can develop an idea that is completely correct, and that doesn\u2019t automatically discredit another person\u2019s idea. We must take into account all concepts and viewpoints when thinking about sociological concepts.",

        "text": "Intro to SOC\nApril 21, 2022\nSOC Final Paper\nDo you think women and men are treated the same in America? Most people would say yes just because of what year it is and how much we have developed as a society, but even with that being said women are treated very differently from men even if some men don\u2019t even realize it. On this subject, there is a large gender divide. Only around half of males believe that men and women are treated equally in society, while only 34% of women agree. Approximately half of women believe society favors men over women, compared to 36% of men. With that being said some men do not realize it in the same way that women do just because they overlook it and don\u2019t really understand that no matter what women have always been looked at as inferior. \nSomething that I have personally experienced with this was actually here at UNCW. My first semester here I was deciding if I wanted to play club volleyball here at UNCW because volleyball has always been something that I love playing and I thought that it would be very good for me and even a way to make some friends. The first day that I went it everyone was just playing king of the court and pick up games and it was really fun. About 30 minutes into playing the boys club volleyball team showed up and wanted to play pick up with us. I did not think anything of it and thought \u201coh this is going to be fun because I bet they are good\u201d. Whenever the boys team came up to us they started acting kind of weird and I did not think anything of it just because I thought oh well maybe they don\u2019t really know who we are yet. They ended up sitting on the sidelines and just watching us play. Shortly after they came back up to us and were like can we play with you guys and make teams. Of course we said yes and none of us thought anything about it until about 20 minutes into playing one of the boys came up to me and said \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be that good at volleyball\u201d. I was really confused because I had no idea who he was and thought to myself well did he expect me to be bad or not know how to play. I kept playing with them and they were constantly complimenting me and saying things like wow you are really good for your height. I know that they did not think anything about that but to me it felt like a backhanded compliment because they were straight up telling me that they didn\u2019t think I was going to be good and I know it was just because I was a girl. \nEventually, I put two and two together and realized that they just expected me to not be as good or be able to keep up and actually play a good game with them just because I was a girl. I know that mens volleyball is a lot different than women at the professional level but anything other than that girls can usually keep up with a boys team or at least everytime I have played a boys team I have been able to. The boys team looked at us girls as weak and did not expect us to be good so they just were not even going to play with or ask us to play with them only until they saw us play. That honestly bothered me so much just because the boys came in and just assumed that we were not going to be good I guess and looked at us as inferior to them just because we were girls. It is just crazy to me how the boys do not even realize what they are saying because they don\u2019t look at it the same way girls do just because they are boys and automatically assume that they will be better at sports and don\u2019t think that girls can keep up with them. \n\u200b\u200bDarwin upheld the gender stereotypes of his period in print, most prominently in \"The Descent of Man.\" In that 1871 research of sexual selection, he concluded that a man achieves \"a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up\" than a female. Meanwhile, he argued that a woman's intuitive abilities are \"typical of the lower races.\" We have talked about gender in society a lot in class and also about different scientists who talk about it and have theories. We read \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, which is a story based on the nineteenth centuy, for questions in class and that article really stood out to me just for the sole fact that the wife in this story was just looked at as women and not even a person just because of her gender and her husband sees himself as more powerful than her. The narrator was married to a man who dominated her and treated her like a child. Her husband was the primary decision maker, and she lived in a society where women were not permitted to dispute their husbands' judgments. He loves and cares for his wife, but their unequal connection stops him from genuinely understanding her and her issues. He contributes to her destruction by treating her as a \"case\" or a \"wife\" rather than a person with a free choice, which is the last thing he wants. The husband in the story did not even realize the way that he was treating her was not fair and because of that the wife was miserable and felt like she had no power and could not do anything. \u200b\u200bAlthough the narrator perceives John as cautious and kind at times, she also sees him as arrogant and manipulating at other times. The narrator eventually regards John as her jailer. While prevailing over her supposed escape from the nursery wallpaper, she eventually loses her sanity. I think that this story really expresses gender roles the best just because her husband truly did love her but just because of society and because he was a man he did not realize that he was treating her unfairly and gave her no say in their relationship. \nWe also read \u201c Women as Other\u201d by Simone de Beauvoir which has the same concept about women being treated differently than men. De Beauvoir claims that the fundamental concept of  'woman' is a male concept. Woman is always 'other' because the male is the 'seer' which means he is the subject and she is the object. Beauvoir's focus on the necessity for women to have access to the same activities and projects as men positions her in the liberal, or second-wave feminism tradition. She insists that women be regarded on an equal footing with men, and that laws, practices, and education be changed to support this. This article also stood out to me because men look at women kind of like objects and just as something fun for them, which is the reason why women get objectified so much by men or looked at as weak and not having power. \nIn conclusion, men may believe that women are treated the same as women just because of where we are today in society and how things actually have changed so much, but in reality there are still some underlying assumptions about men being superior to women even when they do not realize it. I have personally experienced this in college and definitely have many more times than that. Perkins and Beauvoir explain about it very well in their narratives and writings by talking about things that have actually happened and even giving numbers and percentages to prove their points. I think that in today's society the way women are treated is way better than it used to be, but we still are not treated completely equal like we should be even if men think that we are. Women have always been looked at as inferior to men even if men do not even try to think about it like that. Women are looked at as weak and just as something for mens entertainment which is why they objectify women all the time without even trying. No matter what happens women will be looked at inferior just because of how women used to be treated and that is not fair because women can do anything that a man can and should be recognized for all the things that we can do instead of just being looked at as an object and someone who is weak and powerless. \n\n\n",

        "text": "October 18 2021\nSociology 101\nReflection Essay 1\nFor many people, getting hired at their first job is one of the most exciting experiences. You\u2019ve filled out the application, put down all your assets, recommendations, and now, you await a response. Getting the phone call that you\u2019ve received your desired position makes you feel accomplished, especially while juggling high school and extracurriculars, and you realize that all your hard work has paid off. Receiving the position initially is impressive, while typically you are competing against others, however, maintaining your position at the same workplace is even more impressive than emerging victorious throughout the hiring process. \nI have worked at my school\u2019s after school program for four years throughout highschool. Most of my tasks once I clock in after the final school bell rings include helping children with homework and communicating with parents over the phone or in person while simultaneously making sure children aren\u2019t shoving each other down while they play. Because of my many years of experience, I was able to participate in training new workers, and having some input on new applicants to the program. Recently, I discovered shocking news that is unsettling to myself and should be unsettling to society\u2019s collective consciousness (Durkheim) as well.  Although I have worked with this program longer than any of my other coworkers, I am getting paid $1.20 less than some of my fellow coworkers. This information truly puzzled me, and I began to ask myself  \u201cWhy am I receiving less pay for all the time I have spent here, when I\u2019ve been here the longest and have barely received a raise?\u201d After conversing with the only other female that works alongside me, we realized that the two of us were being paid the exact same amount, while our male coworkers were receiving $1.20 higher. Why are the women of this establishment being treated unequally while possessing either the same tasks as the males, or even more than them?\nThe only disgusting conclusion that I have been able to muster regarding this situation is that I have been \u201cother[ed]\u201d (de Beauvoir) inside my workplace without even realizing it. As de Beauvoir discusses in her essay, \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d, about women being \u201cother[ed]\u201d throughout history. Throughout this essay, she criticizes the collective consciousness of society, and how with regards to women, the same beliefs about female inferiority have been collectively held since the beginning of time, starting with religion. De Beauvoir quotes Poulain de la Barre, who discusses how male Jews thank God during their prayers that they were not born a woman. This prayer places so many questions in my mind. Why would these men not want to be a woman so badly that they thank their God for being a male? Is it because they realize as a whole, men are subjugating women?\nAfter finding out this information, I immediately went to my boss in case the unequal pay was a mistake, or perhaps something that was accidentally overlooked. I approached my female boss after work, asking to speak with her in private with the hope that I could resolve this issue occurring at my workplace. However, to my astonishment, the conversation was shut down immediately when I expressed that I was inquiring about unequal pay. I was not even given the opportunity to express my thoughts on the matter, and was told to not discuss my pay with my coworkers again. During this conversation with my boss, I saw a side of her that I had not seen before. This conversation proved to me in a more personal light how the collective consciousness can truly transform a person\u2019s belief, and this especially shocked me since my boss is a woman. I truly would have thought she could relate to me, and realize something unfair was happening, however I was proven wrong by this conversation. \nAfterwards, I felt defeated. I felt as if my voice didn\u2019t matter, but I recognized that my rights were not being respected. I could not figure out why, and I didn\u2019t understand why me not getting the pay I deserved was being shoved under the rug. I could only assume that I was being paid less because I am a woman. I do my job, arguably better than my other coworkers, and never cause any trouble. De Beauvoir quotes Montaigne in her text, \u201cIt is easier to accuse one sex then to excuse the other\u201d. I believe that it is easier to punish female coworkers inside the workplace than to change the ideals of the collective consciousness. It is more convenient for those in control of the ideas held in the collective consciousness to allow society to punish women in every aspect of their lives. \nThe issue of unequality for women is not a new topic in society\u2019s collective consciousness. There have always been laws, \u201ctraditions\u201d, or ideals that have subjugated women, and there was no way for women to defend themselves. Like in my situation, I felt as if there was no way I could defend myself. After being shut down by my boss, I contemplated giving up or not. I feared that me speaking my feelings again would lead to me losing my job. Half of me wanted to stay quiet, but the other half knew that staying quiet is what my workplace wanted me to do. They wanted to get away with the inequality occurring, and not have to change their beliefs about equal pay. \nOddly enough, in my history class, we were discussing feminism during the time these events were happening. I expressed what was happening to my entire class, and my male teacher, who was enraged by the fact I was getting paid less. My other coworker who was also getting paid less was in this class, and she told her side of the story to him as well. What angered my teacher the most was the fact that when my boss was approached, she denied my request. After talking with us in private after class, he told us he was going to the principal to discuss this matter because she overlooked the summer camp and after school program. He recognized the inequality and admitted it, while my boss refused to. \nA few weeks go by, and my boss approaches my friend and I, asking to talk after work. Honestly, I assumed she was going to fire us, and tell us that we crossed some sort of boundary by discussing our pay amongst ourselves and with faculty members. However, this meeting truly resolved nothing. The only thing my boss was able to offer us is that she would talk with our administrator, and see what she could do about getting our issue resolved. This did not give me much hope, because I was not sure if this would actually happen, or if she would even attempt to resolve this issue . However, the fact that my teacher had gone to the principal about our issue did give me some sort of hope that this could possibly be resolved, or that it would act as an example for future females in the workplace at school. Even after all of this, I was still left with the question: Why is this happening? Why are women being treated unfairly, and why is no one doing anything about it?\nThere is no found explanation as to why women and men are treated unequally in society. People might say \u201cthat\u2019s just how it has always been\u201d, but for me, that is not an explanation at all. Simply saying \u201cthat\u2019s how life works\u201d just seems like a lousy excuse for people that do not want to fight the beliefs of the collective consciousness and truly dissect why these types of things are happening to women. De Beauvoir quotes Dorothy Parker in The Second Sex, \u201cMen as well as women, should be regarded by human beings\u201d. There should be no superior or comparison, when in reality, we are all human. De Beauvoir says herself, \u201c[Women] do not authentically assume a subjective attitude\u201d, but it is something that society has conformed to believing themselves. It is evident that my boss has conformed to these ideas about women because she sees no problem with paying my friend and I less than the males that we work with. \nThe issue of my friend and I\u2019s unequal pay was never resolved. We were never provided with more information as to why we were being paid unequally, and we were never spoken to about it again. After this past summer, I quit working at the summer camp. I refuse to work someplace where I have dedicated more time and energy than any of my other coworkers, and still be denied an explanation as to why I am being denied the pay I deserve. If this issue was due to a behavioral problem, or my inability to provide work to the program\u2019s standards, I would have been asked to leave instead of getting paid less. I would have been spoken to about my inadequacy for the job, and been asked to leave. I almost wish that this had instead been the reason I was receiving a lesser pay, but because this issue was never resolved and the response from my boss when I first approached her, I know that I was being paid less because I am a woman. It was almost too coincidental that the two women at the program were being paid less than the men for it to not have been the reason. I was \u201cothered\u201d in my workplace, then refused an explanation. I can also infer that this situation was gender based because my male teacher was able to bring attention to this situation, but I was not, when I was actively being victimized and \u201cothered\u201d, yet my opinion was not enough to cause a change. De Beauvoir comments throughout her text that there really has never been an explanation as to why the collective consciousness supports the idea that women are inferior, and every time that there is an attempt at an explanation, the explanation has been \u201cdictated by men\u2019s interest\u201d. This statement in itself raises too many questions for me to even begin to discuss, but supports the statement that those in the superior position, which just so happens to be men, are able to dictate the gap between men and women. \nThe idea that men and women are unequal will not change until the beliefs of the collective consciousness change. It is this reason that women are still being paid less, not receiving equal job opportunities, and our rights are being thrown around in congress by men who do not have a say. The inequality between genders is an ongoing argument fueled by the collective consciousness that is trapped in a vicious cycle. When I turned in my two weeks notice, I informed my boss I was quitting due to my rights not being fulfilled at this workplace. I hope that in the future, my step towards equality for women will be appreciated, and not viewed as a cowardly exit to those in society, and it will force them to question the catalysts that led to my resignation. \n",

        "text": "850603180\nHealthcare: A Place of Oppression\n\tIt is a common experience between women to be ignored when your pain is at an all time high. Whether it is menstrual cramps or an undiagnosed chronic illness, women are repeatedly ignored and brushed to the side for being \u201ctoo much\u201d and \u201coverdramatic\u201d when it comes to pain. After hearing these phrases over and over, a woman may start to believe this and push their pain to the sides; complying with the stereotype that women are indeed too dramatic and that they really have nothing to be complaining about. In modern day times, women are told that their pain is not as bad as it seems, due to the place they have been put into by men as the \u201cothers\u201d or secondary counterparts. Women must push past these boundaries to make themselves heard as individuals. \n\tThis argument continued until the nurse finally gave in and tested Mary for a kidney infection. While nurses are usually supposed to take the sample and then move to another room to test, the nurse gathered the sample, looked Mary in the eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to test this in front of you to prove that there is nothing wrong with you.\u201d The nurse tested the sample, and of course, Mary had a kidney infection. After the results came back, the nurse still acted cold and unsympathetic towards Mary, even though Mary was right about her own symptoms. She had to fight a nurse, someone whose job it is to help people and believe their patients to even get a test and receive the medical care she needed to feel better and to get the medication she needed. To make matters even more confusing, the nurse was a woman, but because she was educated and trained by a system that favors men, she still brushed Mary off. If Mary had perhaps been a man, her symptoms would have immediately been listened to, and she would have been tested and treated promptly. This situation explains the way that women are treated as \u201cothers\u201d and overlooked because they aren\u2019t considered individuals, but rather counterparts to their men. \n\tIn Woman as Other, Simone DeBeauvoir explains the position of women in comparison to men. As a feminist and a student of social theory and modern philosophy, she can understand the female struggle, and why that struggle exists in almost every social situation. DeBeauvoir lived through this type of oppression through the scope of a upper class perspective. She interprets the roles of women and men in the modern world thoroughly and states, \u201cHe is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is the Other\u201d (DeBeauvoir 260). This is a perfect explanation of women when they are compared to men. DeBeuvoir explains the role of women in society within her writing, especially as simply a counterpart to men. She also explains that women often play into these roles, as they have been convinced by societal norms that they are the \u201cothers\u201d, and their opinions have no relevance. \n\tWomen find breaking out of this entrapment to be difficult. As explained in Woman as Other, women tend to have no shared stories, religion, past, or sense of community like other communites such as African Americans, those of Jewish descent, and immigrant workers. A woman is completely alone in her own world, and while different women might be experiencing the same situations, they would never know because it has been instilled in modern women that they should not be complaining about their issues, but instead staying quiet and subdued for the men around them. DeBeauvoir states, \u201cThey live dispersed among men, tied by homes, work, economic interests, and social conditions to certain men \u2013 fathers or husbands \u2013 more closely than to other women\u201d (DeBeauvoir 261). Women are so disconnected from their own selves that they become disconnected from the women around them, even though most women suffer from the same oppression daily. \n\tWhile the way that Mary was treated in a place of medical care is inexcusable, it is expected. Since the nurse was a women pushed into a career typically controlled by men, she is so disconnected from her patients (especially women) that she can\u2019t believe a woman fully when they say they are in extreme pain. When women play into this stereotype, this enforces their role as the \u201cother\u201d. Playing into this stereotype also continues to allow men to stand on the pedestal of being the \u201cAbsolutes\u201d. Men\u2019s words are law, as show throughout history, and when they say that a woman is overreacting to pain, they must be right. It is often difficult to not play into this stereotype unfortunately. I find that even I do it when talking about an injury because, often, a man in the conversation will counter the pain with the question of \u201cBut have you even had this happen to you?\u201d or something similar. After hearing this so many times, it is easier for women to just stay silent in the way that men want them to be rather than expressing more pain or discomfort and sticking up for themselves. \n\tIt is a common tactic for men to push women to the side, especially when they are talking about their own personal pain. Simone DeBeuvoir explains it best when she labels women as \u201cothers\u201d. Healthcare is a place in which a woman can be completely brushed off when she should be listened to and taken care of, which puts women into this \u201cother\u201d position. It is not \u201cover dramatic\u201d to complain about pain, men do it all the time. To tell women that they need to stop complaining about something that isn\u2019t that bad is to play into the stereotype that women should be silent and submissive, the perfect woman for a man or their \u201cOne\u201d. While Mary\u2019s story may seem unbelievable, women suffer from this sort of treatment every day in the medical field. Whether their pain is mild or the most excruciating feeling they have every felt, women deserve to feel heard and cared for in the world today.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t",

        "text": "10/17/2021\nSOC 105-001 \nThe \u201cBeauty Myth\u201d and its Effects on a Woman\u2019s Life\n\tBefore a child is even born, there are already plans and standards created for the child. The standards for each child differs around the sex of the baby. For instance, little girls are raised around the standard that if a boy is mean to you, he likes you - that it is just dandy to absorb insults from a male. Why is it that boys aren\u2019t raised in the same manner? To be constantly thinking about the interactions they have with girls, to live up to women\u2019s standards? \nFor women, the standards end up being more costly in comparison to men. Women end up sacrificing their lives in order to please a man; to raise a family, to feed the family, clean up after a family, not to go to school, to dress properly, to not act provocatively, to judge others that act out of character - those who are not womanly - it\u2019s seen as a competition. The saying that women live in a man\u2019s world is correct, slowly adapting to change, but is still valid in today\u2019s circumstances. Still valid in my life directly. \nMy family pushed classic feminine and masculine traits on my siblings and I. My mother didn\u2019t go to college and she met my father at a job. After they got married and had my brother, Jack, my mother was deemed the one to stay home and raise Jack while my father worked. Growing up watching my mother take care of us, I thought that this is what I was supposed to do in life. That taking care of my husband and kids is all that I would do. At the time, I thought that the purpose of life was that - now, I am absolutely terrified of falling into that trap. My mother didn\u2019t have much say during political discourse over dinner; how women should live their lives, what is a respectable woman, how men should be the \u2018man of the house,\u2019 etc. My brother usurped these ideologies from my father and my mother didn\u2019t reject anything, encouraging him through silence. \nGrowing up, I was definitely pushed to do girlier things. My neighbor that I had playdates with, Cecelia, decided to stop hanging out with me because I was too boyish. I played soccer for the majority of my life and she thought that I should be partaking in girlier sports like cheerleading. Because I played soccer competitively, I was very fit and muscular. Being muscular, more than some of the boys, I would be seen as masculine and not attractive. Boys in elementary school were not a fan of girls who were confident and beat them in sports or P.E. games. The boys would then draw a liking to the classic feminine girls. No one in elementary school likes playing the part of the odd girl out. That said, I moderated my life to still play soccer and look the way that I did, but I acted more feminine; more flirty, paying my attention to boys and if they liked me or not. As soon as I started acting that way, I started gaining popularity. \nAs I got older, things changed. In middle school, I started becoming a woman; I got my period, I developed breasts, I was taller than some of the boys, the whole shabang. Because of this, I matched the current beauty standard that derived from the Kardashian/Jenner family. I became curvy and I was \u201cdistracting\u201d the boys in my class. I was told to wear more than our uniform required. When I physically matured, I was socially acceptable by the boys in my grade. I was the hot topic of seventh and eighth grade due to my breasts. Since middle school, I have endured more instances similar and worse to those growing up; however, now that I am in college, I am able to conceptualize them. \nNaomi Wolf and her concept of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d surrounds the reproductiveness of women. The ideology that men go and fight in wars for beautiful women or their current wife(s). Competition between women changes as the beauty standard changes - this includes behavior, women have to behave in such a manner to achieve beauty. The value of women is based on the looks, or beauty of women. \nWhy are women subjected to this \u201cbeauty myth?\u201d The concept of competition between women allows for a hatred to form amongst others that are deemed socially threatening (beautiful). This hatred advocates against forming communities or support of each other, as women. The lack of support and communities formed between women allowed for the dominance of men and manipulation of women. Marketing of preferred images of women or beauty standards of women was used as political ammunition to control women and keep them submissive. \nNow that there\u2019s an establishment that men are the reason for the \u201cbeauty standard,\u201d the next question is why? What sort of myth is holding men hostage to oppressing women? The only identifiable causes are hegemonic masculinity and the beauty myth. A simple definition of hegemonic masculinity surrounds the stereotype of men being strong, providing for the family (\u201cman of the house\u201d), not showing emotion in front of others, etc. This domination creates a \u2018split household\u2019 where women are silenced and are servants of men. Men played the role of maintaining this role of women through abuse, psychological and physical. The continuation of hegemonic masculinity is generational, but also economical. The economy benefits from the underpayment of women. \nMy family pushed feminine and masculine traits on me and my siblings due to hegemonic masculinity. My mother played the submissive role to my father, and my brother played the generational aspect. My sister and I hope to play the role of not being economically oppressed, of course that is still being worked on as we obtain education. My brother is psychologically a genetic replication of my father, following all of his footsteps - purposefully. My father never wanted to cry in front of me or my family. I have seen him cry once in all my life, he usually releases his emotions through anger. My brother also refuses to cry and has anger management issues. My sister ironically has anger issues as well, but cries more and is still deemed to be \u201cweak.\u201d My mother is emotional and not taken seriously if she is mad, and I am in a similar position to my mother. \nBeing forced to change my personality in elementary school created competition. All the other girls had flirty personalities and their lives revolved around boys. When I decided to join the party, drama started. Hard to believe, but my school maintained the same 60 people from kindergarten to high school. Due to competition identified within the beauty myth, I was considered a threat because more of the boys had crushes on me. The other girls in my class started to spread rumors about me in attempts to make the boys stop liking me. Even as children, the boys hindered the advancement of girls being friends with each other due to their standards. The boys controlled the standards of our grade and anything else was considered undesirable. By growing up this way, learning how to impress or live by a certain standard created by men, causes this domino effect that takes place for the majority of your life. Personally the domino effect didn\u2019t end for me until my junior year of high school. \nDue to the physical maturity that took place in middle school, a newfound value was created. I was valued as a person, as a young woman, due to hormones and development. I was overly sexualized in middle school and distracting because I was wanted and showed means of reproduction. During middle school, and still to this day, there was a certain beauty standard that was starting to be portrayed by the media that I fit into. Physically I am curvy, short, and I look submissive. Those were some physical features that were wanted then and are still wanted now. Because of the personality change I had in fifth grade, that carried on in middle school. Even behaviorally I was wanted. I was never rude to any boy - I let them walk all over me. I was liked by the majority - insinuating that I kept a good reputation for myself. I was innocent, I was pure and they wanted to ruin that. I was considered to be exotic. My behavior and physicality in middle school portrayed me to be the perfect woman. It kept me to be the perfect woman in a man\u2019s eye for a long time. My beauty was accessible to men, fulfilling the beauty myth. \nOverall, women are conditioned to live in society as objects of men. We sleep under the stars known as the beauty myth. We were not the creators of the standards and expectations, we could not change them. We were forced inside this bubble before we were even born by others already oppressed by it. The value of a woman, how successful she is or liked is dependent on how beautiful she is physically and behaviorally. The image of a woman is created by a man and is used as political ammunition to limit women\u2019s advancement in society. Men continue to create standards for women based on their own standards and roles as a man.

        "text": "11/20/21\nSoc. 105\nThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation V.S. Religion \n\nEmile Durkheim and Yuval Harari both talked about religion and its role in society. Some of their ideas lined up but others were contradictory. Durkheim believed that everything circled back to religion, that fundamental categories of thought and science had religious roots and all great social institutions were born from religion. Harari believed religion brought people together but had no role in government or political decisions. Harari thought that different societies with different ideas created conflict and made it harder to come to solutions. I will be focusing on the similarities and differences between their thoughts in order to fully understand how religion and society are connected. \nFirst, Durkheim wrote about the cultural logic of collective representation, in which he talks about how social institutions, thoughts, and sciences all come from religion. The collective consciousness is a collection of beliefs, ideas, and sentiments shared by the community. Those thoughts and ideas shape collective representation, which is defined as a symbol, artifact, or narrative that embodies the collective beliefs of a specific group. An example of collective representation could be the American flag, it represents all the values that our country was formed on. There is a shared sense of reality, morality, and identity based on common or shared experiences. He also stated that the collective shapes the individual\u2019s perspective on how life should be lived. Durkheim believed that religion brings the community together through a shared belief and in turn, furnishes us with both stability and truth. This truth and stability give access for social institutions to be formed through the collective consciousness and religion. These social institutions could be the government, politics, education, healthcare, and so many more things. \nFurthermore, When talking about the role religion plays in society Harari says we need to focus on three main societal problems: technical, economic, and identity. Religion used to be helpful in solving technical problems in areas like agriculture, as they would use divine calendars to decide when to plant and when to harvest. Temple rituals also helped by securing rainfall to prevent pests, and when there was an agricultural crisis, farmers would turn to priests who talked to the gods. Religion is no longer a solution to technical problems because even those who are religious know that scientists have better answers for agricultural and medicine evolution. Harari states that the whole world is a single civilization because when one thing works everyone just uses that method. Religion cannot be used to solve policy issues because your religious status does not always line up with your political views. Even though one might use the bible or Quran to defend their position on a subject, the real source comes from scientific theories and political movements. An example of this is in cars, as evangelical\u2019s may drive gas-powered cars, while Catholics will drive electric cars. They might claim it's because of their beliefs, but the decision is really rooted in their scientific beliefs to save the earth. The one issue religion has an impact on is identity issues. Harari believes that religion is made up of a series of false truths or myths but he says that our identities are made from fictional stories rather than science or economics. We learned that trying to scientifically assign identities is dangerous after Nazis and communists attempted to. Since those events, scientists have decided not to give out natural identities to people. Harari says that the one thing religion does is tells us who we are, some religious traditions fill the earth with joy and love, while others fill the earth with anger and ugliness. Even though Harari does not think religion is real, he does believe it brings people together. \nHowever, It is important to know exactly what religion is and how it functions. Religion is defined as the belief in or worship of a higher power, usually a god or multiple gods. This higher power gives life a new meaning to people, it gives morals and values so people know how they should live their lives. We learn from Durkheim that religion shapes the individual, without a higher power to rely on it could be harder to make your own values for your life. Religion also helps people through hard times, it gives people a reason to why things happen and answers some existential questions no one really has the answers to. Of course, many people also don\u2019t have a religion they find self and form morals in other things, which also works as it is all based off of personal preference, which leads us into the similarities and differences between Durkheim and Harari. \n\tHarari and Durkheim both believe one thing, that religion brings people together through shared beliefs, values, and morals. Durkheim said that religion has three major functions in society, as one of those is to provide social cohesion to help maintain social solidarity through shared rituals and beliefs. Harari said that people are brought together through religious myths and fallacies. These two ideas, although stated very differently mean the same thing. In pre-modern eras society needed religion but in todays world a society can still thrive without religion. If religion did not exist there would be less discrimination, which would possibly cause less wars and maybe less deaths. There could also be complete anarchy though with no morals or beliefs, if people aren\u2019t held up to a moral standard then they would pay no mind to how their actions affect other people.\nBoth Durkheim and Harari would also argue that religion gives people a purpose in life. Many people need a purpose to believe that doing anything is really worth it and religion gives that to them. Harari does not explicitly state that religion gives purpose, but he implies that it gives meaning to people's lives, he believes it is a false meaning, but it's one, nonetheless. Durkheim talks about how the collective consciousness and collective representation, which are rooted by religion, give meaning to people\u2019s life. An example of this is Christianity, from my personal experience in church, the bible says that God will love you no matter what. Even though he has eternal love for all his children they still strive to not disappoint him and devote their lives to following his word. There is also the belief that God has a plan for all of us and that gives Christians a sense of hope that even when they are lost and confused and do not have a foreseeable plan for where their life is heading, they can trust that God has one and they do have a purpose on this Earth. \nThe difference between Durkheim and Harari\u2019s beliefs lies in if religion should play a role in government, politics, and policy making. When Durkheim talks about the collective consciousness, he says that religion forms great social institutions, two of those institutions being government and politics. Unlike Harari, Durkheim believes religion is real and is an expression of society as a whole. The second function he gave of religion in his reading was that it provides social control to enforce religious-based morals to help maintain conformity and control in society. Since he believes that religion brings control he believes that policy and government decisions should be made with the thought of religion in mind. According to Durkheim, the collective consciousness makes the self, therefore, the self gives the power to make meaningful decisions. That being said those in the power to make decisions and determine policies should stick with their religious morals. On the other hand, Harari thinks religion is fake and all it creates differing viewpoints that make it harder to come to a decision. He believes that religion is based on emotions and myths and policy making should be based on science-based theories. He states that religion and nationalism divide our nation into hostile parts when it comes to making decisions, which defeats the original purpose to bring people together. As I mentioned earlier according to Harari, technical and economic problems can\u2019t possibly be solved by religion so there is no way policies that decide how people live their lives should be taken with religion into account. \nAnother main difference between Durkheim and Harari\u2019s beliefs is two important words, reason and excuse. Durkheim tells us that religion helps create the self because we find a reason as to why things happen and why we are on this Earth. His last function of religion that he mentioned was that it offers meaning and purpose to answer many existential questions. Without this meaning we could lose ourselves, whether that\u2019s our self-worth or our drive to be successful, you could completely forget who you are. Humans try to get answers to questions they don\u2019t know, especially questions like, \u2018what happens after we die?\u2019 Religion answers some of these questions to give stability in individual lives, and in-turn, stability in societies. Harari mentions multiple times that religion is an excuse, it\u2019s a made-up reason for questions we can\u2019t answer. Since Harari does not think religion is real he believes it is an excuse to cope with the fact that we can\u2019t answer all the questions. An example of this was when he mentioned pre-modern times when agriculture was solved through religion, it was not real but they needed some form of solution so the farmers went to the one thing they knew would give them an answer, their religion, and their gods. Harari still believes that religion gives a purpose, but he uses the word excuse because that purpose is based off of myths according to him. \nDurkheim and Harari have many similarities and differences regarding religion. Both of them believe that religion brings society together through beliefs, morals, and values. They also both believe that religion gives people a purpose in life. In contrast, Durkheim believes that religion should have a role in policy making, while Harari believes that religion should be completely left out of decision making. The other difference is that Durkheim believes religion is a reason, meanwhile Harari believes religion is an excuse. This shows us that even though there are so many different religions out there and so many different beliefs, we know for sure that religion has the power to bring people together for better or for worse, and that our society revolves around the aspect of religion.

        "text": "Megan Del Giudice\nSOC 105-001\n28 April 2021\nSocial Media Affects Body Image Perceptions \n\tSocial media has easily taken over the minds of many as it has become more accessible and easier to use. Since social media is open for anyone, people can post whatever they want and can post as much as they want. There are no guidelines for what people are allowed to post which creates a free-for-all environment. This being said, social media can create a toxic environment as people tend to flash their perfect lives which leads others to believe a false persona. These face-tuned pictures make viewers feel bad about their bodies, and they become envious of these strangers because they have what seems to be a perfect body. Women tend to only post pictures where they look beautiful in the eyes of today\u2019s standards so they can be praised and feel like they too fit the \u201cperfect body type.\u201d The most recent issue that social media has harmed is women\u2019s body image. People are seeing pictures of half-naked women who have the \u201cperfect body\u201d and the comment sections are flooded with questions about how to get that figure, praises of how perfect their life looks, and comments about how jealous people are of them. Today women are pressured to look a certain way because all they see on social media are pictures of skinny women who have the \u201cperfect body.\u201d Throughout this paper, I will discuss how social media is negatively affecting women\u2019s body images and introducing widespread insecurities and set back in women\u2019s progression for feminisms. \n\tDuring the semester we talked about Naomi Wolf and the Beauty Myth which discussed how images of beauty are used against women. The literature emphasizes how women\u2019s appearance makes women inferior to men in society and how women are held to an unreasonably high beauty standard. This beauty standard has harmed women and how they perceive themselves as comments are made about how they should look and dress in public. Wolf says that women are held to these standards because women are held too old, devaluing traits like being known as a household helper, or a mother. Social media has contributed to the idea of women needing to look a certain way and this affects women\u2019s thoughts about their bodies and how they see themselves.  \n\tSocial media is so powerful because there is so much distance between the viewer and the poster. This distance allows for many messages to be misinterpreted as the interaction is solely online. People also believe that because they are behind a screen, they can post anything they want. The people who post on these platforms don\u2019t see how their content affects their viewers which gives them the power to keep posting what they want. If the people who post don\u2019t know they are hurting anyone then why would they stop posting? \nAnother factor that makes mass media a culprit of women\u2019s body issues is the interactivity involved in it (Perloff 2014). Anyone is allowed to interact with the post and leave a comment saying whatever they please. Words on a screen aren\u2019t always perceived how the writer intended them to sound which is where many people tend to get hurt. Social media is also an \u201cimmensely more personal outlet than conventional impersonal mass media\u201d (Perloff, 2014). People can relate posts to their life and take the words said more personally. This opens the door for self-comparison and the creation of body insecurities. Social media platforms are also open for viewing and posting 24/7, which gives women the opportunity to constantly compare their bodies to others and feel discomfort in their own skin (Perloff, 2014).\n\tAccording to Hogue\u2019s and Mills\u2019 study (2019), when people interact with \u201cattractive peers\u2019 appearance-based social media\u201d posts they are more likely to have a worsened self-body image. Interaction is a key part of this because it shows that people are actively trying to compare themselves to the person in the post. Many people interact when they come across body image posts because they want to know how a person looks a certain way so they can try to achieve that ideal body too. This comparison is detrimental to one\u2019s health because it brings feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. The downside of social media is the secrecy behind it. Certain posts could be photoshopped and touched up in a million different ways to make the women look \u201cbeautiful,\u201d but the viewer would never know. Without this knowledge, the viewer will feel insecure and have a poor mindset about how she looks. \n\tIn \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d Wolf talks about \u201cbeauty pornography\u201d which links commodified beauty to sexuality. Wolf (1991) claims that this concept has entered into mainstream media and is undermining \u201cwomen\u2019s new and vulnerable sense of sexual self-worth.\u201d According to Peter and Valkenburg (2017), sexual content in the media has grown bigger in the most recent decades which means more people are being exposed to these unrealistic beauty standards. Social media is the perfect platform for people to post their bodies and show off their figures for anyone to see. However, more women are photoshopping and altering their pictures to fit social media\u2019s beauty standards. This is what is creating the commodified beauty that Wolf is talking about. Some social media posts promote eating disorders and \u201cinvasive, potentially deadly \"cosmetic\" surgeries\u201d that will help women get the perfect body (Wolf, 1991). Without knowing it our society is connecting manufactured beauty with sexuality and body image disorders. These sexual posts create negative body image thoughts in women\u2019s heads because all they see in the media are skinny perfect women. Additionally, when women view such posts, they think that this is the way all women look, yet this is quite incorrect. Women tend to collectively think that they are larger than all the other women around them, but this is far from true. All women, if not most, feel the same insecurities about wanting to change their body, no matter their weight. Unfortunately, all women are in the same boat about wanting to change to fit into the media's beauty standards. Even the skinny models that are being highlighted by the media feel pressure to be skinnier so they can still fit into the beauty standard. If all women feel the same about wanting to look appealing in the eyes of the media, then all women should understand that everyone is different, and everyone should be able to be comfortable in their own skin. \n\tSocial media has also started to objectify women, reducing their importance to their \u201csexual appeal in terms of their outer appearance\u201d (Peter & Valkenburg, 2017). Our society has also put women\u2019s sexual activities as the most important criteria for their attractiveness and has made women out to be \u201csexual playthings waiting to please men\u2019s sexual desires\u201d (Peter & Valkenburg, 2017). Most media content today displays women\u2019s bodies in a way where certain body parts are emphasized which sends an underlying message. Social media tends to define women by their looks and advertising that women\u2019s bodies should look a certain way so that males find them attractive. Wolf (1991) notes that we are using \u201cimages of female beauty as a political weapon against women\u2019s advancement.\u201d By putting out the idea that women\u2019s bodies need to look a certain way so that other people, especially men, will find them attractive makes people feel insecure about their looks. Women are even pushing this notion on to other women as they post sexualized pictures of their skinny, perfect bodies on social media. Wolf (1991) believes that we are halting our progression of feminism by letting this beauty myth \u201cpoison our freedom\u201d and letting women believe that they need to look a certain way to be appealing to others. \n\tIn a study done by Grabe et al. (2008) it was said that body dissatisfaction has risen as a \u201ccore aspect of women\u2019s physical and mental health.\u201d This study also points to the media as the culprit of body insecurities as it shoves images of thinness onto our society. The images of women that are being shown in today\u2019s media are thinner than in the past, thinner than the actual female population, and thinner than the criteria needed for anorexia (Grabe et al., 2008). This is creating an unattainable goal that is starting to become fanaticized. This study also discovered that media exposure is linked to decreased levels of body satisfaction in women. Moreover, it was concluded that exposure to the thin body type has become more present in the 2000s than it was in the 1990s (Grabe et al., 2008). Social media is a predominant factor in this claim as it allows for the fast-paced spread of ideas and creates a toxic environment. Even Wolf (1991) states that women would \u201crather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal.\u201d Women nowadays have more power, money, and legal status than they have ever had in the past, yet they physically feel worse about themselves now than any woman before them has ever felt (Wolf, 1991). It\u2019s unfortunate to hear that women have come so far in their struggle for gaining rights and respect just to be brought back down because of the way their bodies look. \n\tSocial media has evolved into a toxic environment that pushes unattainable and unrealistic body images on women today. Naomi Wolf\u2019s literature perfectly complements the ideas of the negative impacts that social media has on women\u2019s body satisfaction. Wolf believes that women\u2019s beauty is being used as a weapon against them and their progression in feminism is being halted as women are again being reduced to their bodies. Women have come so far in their fight for equality and now their main roadblock is their own bodies. Female beauty is a weapon that is being used against all women and the worst part is, is that women are doing this to other women (Wolf, 1991). Social media enables this by allowing anyone to post whatever content they want for all to see. The lack of connection between the poster and the viewer brings upon miscommunication and secrets which creates an untruthful and negative environment. This is vital because social media is distorting how people look which creates confusion among the female community. Women have started to post more about their bodies and the images of women being shown by the media are more sexualized and show off the thin perfect body type. People are becoming envious of other body types and are developing insecurities and dissatisfactions with the ways they look. Today\u2019s notions of beauty are getting out of hand and leading women to go to extreme measures just to fit into today\u2019s beauty standard. Social media is evidently the leading factor in women\u2019s insecurities as it is using women\u2019s beauty as a weapon against women as a whole and is setting back feminism progression.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nGrabe, S., Ward, L.

        "text": "SOC 105\nFinal Paper\nSkinny Shaming \n\tA large majority of individuals have been told this sentence by someone in their lifetime: \u201cdo not make fun of someone because of their weight.\u201d Usually, when this sentence is uttered, it is in response to someone making remarks about a person that is overweight. I have lived my entire life as a substantially underweight human being, I have been picked on harshly about my \u201cscrawniness\u201d by friends, family members and even complete strangers. If I had a dollar for every time someone told me I \u201cneed some meat on my bones\u201d or \u201csomebody get this boy a cheeseburger,\u201d I would not be attending college right now, due to my fortune. A sentence I have never been heard uttered is \u201cyou need to take some meat off them bones\u201d or \u201csomebody get this boy a salad.\u201d Why is that? Why is it the case that making remarks to a person who is struggling with obesity so extremely frowned up in society although it is perfectly normal to make remarks on someone is struggling with their weight at the opposite extreme? That is what we are going to attempt to answer.\n\tWhat part of our society allows skinny shaming to happen and believes this type of behavior is okay and does not harm any party? It is almost as if this form of behavior is a collective conscious in our society. Others in our society have deemed these actions as okay and others begin joining in, soon creating a new norm on what is allowed to be said involving an individual\u2019s weight. Growing up as a young kid, I noticed this behavior all the time. Many of my friends in grade school only weighed maybe 20 to 30 pounds more than me, yet I was always singled out regarding my weight. Grownups, people I was supposed to look up to and respect, poked fun at me about my body and I could never make sense of it. I knew that what they did hurt my feelings, what I just could not understand was that if I made a remark talking about someone\u2019s weight, I was scolded, it felt like a double standard. This has been something that I have constantly dealt with and when I told my parents the topic of this paper, they themselves were taken by surprise at how true the double standard truly is. They had gone my whole life never knowing the issues that I had with constantly being criticized by others regarding my weight. This does not make my parents bad people for not seeing this sort of thing, it just simply shows how big of a hold it has on the world and not many people are even aware of it. I believe that what has happened in our society is an example of the social learning theory. \n\tThe social learning theory as we\u2019ve discussed in class is basically just learning from others. Seeing what others do, seeing the reaction it brings, and then determining whether this behavior is accepted by others. It is like how a child learns and develops throughout their life. They first learn to talk by mimicking the sounds he or she hears from others, soon after, learning how to form these words into coherent sentences. A child learns all of this based on repetition and listening to what other people are saying. Then the next step of their life as they grow older is learning what is right and wrong, how does the child achieve this? Through the help of their parents of course, but also by seeing what the adults around them are doing. So, in other words if these children are growing up and seeing that it is wrong to curse, wrong to take things from others, wrong to bully people because they are overweight, however, never being told that it is wrong to bully those that are underweight, they will spend their entire lives believing this harmful behavior is okay. This results in them intentionally or unintentionally bestowing these same values into their own kids and the never-ending cycle continues. \n\tIt is no secret that many people in our society struggle with self-image and body consciousness. This is a popular topic among females due to the beauty myth that instructs them to maintain an impossible standard of physical beauty to adhere to the women that are seen commercially and are deemed \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cideal.\u201d It is only recently that there has begun to be a push back on this sort of culture although there is still much more ground to make up. You are now seeing plus sized models advertising clothes and more women with a wide array of body types and physiques being televised allowing for women of the public to see these women and say, \u201cI look like her, and people think she\u2019s beautiful, that means I am too.\u201d I also believe that this beauty myth is fuel for people to give excuse to their behavior towards people that are underweight. It is viewed as ideal to be skinny; skinny is the goal for many people in America. It seems that the public has decided that if you are skinny then you are happy with your body; this is not always the case though. People that struggle with gaining weight are just as unhappy with their failed results as overweight people attempting to lose weight.\n\tMy girlfriend is the first person to ever explain, using this reason, as to why people believe it is okay to skinny shame. First, it is a mixture of people believing that individuals are happy with their bodies when they are super skinny because it is deemed ideal; the belief that they have no shame in their looks. Secondly, these remarks are a reflection on the bully\u2019s own insecurities; their jealousy that they were not born with society\u2019s \u201cperfect body.\u201d Regardless of the latter, I believe that the beauty myth has not only destroyed women\u2019s ideology about the perfect figure, but everyone\u2019s idea of it, no matter the gender. As I stated above, if the entire world thinks that you are the perfect weight because you are skinny, and they make fun of you for it, then there really is no harm, plus, they have seen everyone else do the same thing throughout their life and have been convinced it is not an issue.\n\tAs a person that has spent their whole life hearing about how small I am and constantly being underestimated, believing I am not strong enough to do something or I am too weak to fight, it takes a toll on my self-image. I have proved people wrong within these categories a vast number of times, but there have also been times where I let myself down and was even further ridiculed. I just cannot understand how the collective conscious of our society and the social learning that has been instituted has made people believe that this type of behavior is normal and/or okay. My whole life I have heard to not comment on people\u2019s obesity and it frustrates me when no one will do the same for my side of the spectrum. I understand that there are societal values beyond my scope of understanding that have caused this issue but if I had to point to a root cause for this, it would be the sociological concepts I have discussed above. I also believe that if we took the time to make this a more well-known topic as we have done regarding fat shaming, we could work towards progression of fixing this issue. There will always be bullies in the world that will tarnish our self-image, but I believe that a majority of the people who have skinny shamed me never did it to cause me harm, they just believed, because society told them so, that it was okay.",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n10/10/21\nSocietal Control of Social Situations\n\tAccepting change, whether it\u2019s as small as throwing away a favorite old shirt or as drastic as moving to a new city, can be extremely challenging. Change can be scary as we often don\u2019t know what to expect. There is no way to know exactly what will happen in every new situation. We get comfortable in our current situation and changing that constant routine can be stressful and even scary. Once we find something that makes us feel comfortable, we don\u2019t want to try anything else and risk having it be worse than what we had before. This uncertainty that comes with new adventures has produced a society where change is difficult to initiate and often prevented altogether. As members of society, we each develop a certain role to play, and we often stick to that role. Once we find our role, the fear and uncertainty surrounded by change makes it difficult for us to shift into a new role. Our concern about creating potential problems or embarrassment in a situation often prevents us from accepting these changes and allowing people to move between roles. Stopping each other from changing roles in turn prevents our society from seeing any real change with social issues. \nGrowing up, and even still today, I have always been a more introverted person. I love to spend time with friends, but I always tend to be quieter and more reserved when I\u2019m around people I don\u2019t know very well. When I\u2019m at home it\u2019s like I\u2019m a completely different person: I crack jokes and I don\u2019t mind being silly. I\u2019m more comfortable around my close friends and family, so I\u2019m not embarrassed to act like myself while I\u2019m with them. In public, though, I\u2019m never the friend doing crazy things or the first one to shout something out in class. I have always been so worried everyone was going to judge me or make fun of me if I acted how I did at home. However, as I have started to get older, and especially towards the end of high school, I noticed that I was becoming more confident and was shifting into a more outgoing person. I learned that I didn\u2019t need to feel embarrassed for acting like myself or being the person I truly am. Once I realized this, I was able to apply it to all aspects of my life and show a different side of myself that not many people had seen before. Even when I was around people I didn\u2019t know as well, I found that I was beginning to have a different attitude and I wasn\u2019t afraid to truly be myself. \nI saw the most significant change in my personality while I was at softball. I have been playing softball since I was around 8 years old. From growing up playing tee ball in the yard, to playing in my first travel game, to playing on the varsity team in high school, a significant portion of my life has been devoted to softball. The softball field is like my second home, and my teams have always felt more like family than just friends. After playing for so many years I was more comfortable and confident in myself when I was on the softball field. Also, when you spend hours practicing and playing together, you form a bond with your teammates greater than just friendship. It was a shock, then, when I realized that high school softball was actually the hardest setting to act like myself in. Even though I considered those teammates to be close friends, I slowly realized that I wasn\u2019t acting like myself while I was at practice. \nIn my town, softball was completely run by politics. If you didn\u2019t have the right last name you weren\u2019t going to play, and I certainly did not have the right name. From the very first day of tryouts freshman year, I could tell that I was not one of the popular girls. The coach loved the girls in one friend group who were showing off and acting like they owned the place. I quickly realized that I would not be one of those favorites and accepted my place as the quiet freshman. At that point in time, I was completely terrified to be playing with the upperclassmen and felt like I shouldn\u2019t be there at all. I stuck to myself and was too scared to even try to be more outgoing. Even as the years passed, I noticed I was still stuck as the shy underclassmen. Despite growing and changing as a person, I realized that my teammates were not open to the same kind of change, preventing me from being myself when I was there. At school before practice, I was able to be myself, but the second I arrived to practice it was like a switch flipped and I was back to my quiet, freshman self. I didn\u2019t realize this was happening for a long time, but by senior year I really began to notice that I was a completely different person around my teammates than while I was with my other friends. The confident, more outgoing personality that shined most of the time was suddenly gone whenever I was around my teammates. \n\tOne sociological concept I have been able to observe throughout my own experiences (and especially at softball) is Goffman\u2019s presentation of the self. Erving Goffman, a Canadian sociologist, suggested the idea that the self is collectively produced. What he meant by that was that as a society we live life on a stage and are actors performing different roles. Our interactions with everyone else performing are what defines our own role and performance in the situation. The different factors like setting, environment, and people involved all work together to create the overall performance. In any interaction, each and every one of us has a certain role to play. For example, a student\u2019s role is to prepare for, attend, and participate in class, and to complete any assigned work outside of class. The teacher\u2019s role is to prepare the lesson, lead class discussions, and prepare students to complete assignments. Together, the students and teacher are actively giving a performance in the classroom. The teacher\u2019s actions and attitude affect how the students act, and how the students are acting impacts how the teacher teaches the class. Additionally, the role we play is greatly influenced by the situation we are in. In a social interaction, if one person does not take part and play their role, then the rest of the performance is thrown off. As the actors in the performance, we take cues from our environment and others around us to determine what our role is in a certain situation. For example, if we are surrounded by close friends and family, we might act more comfortable and informally; a greeting in this setting might be a hug. In contrast, when we meet someone new or are in a business setting, we might act in a more professional manner; a greeting in this situation will most likely be a firm handshake. How we act and the role we play greatly depends on the conditions created by everyone involved. One of the most important aspects of these social performances is a collective understanding of the situation and each other\u2019s roles. Everyone must be aware of the definition of the situation, or the role that each person involved is trying to achieve. It is an expectation that everyone involved is invested in making everyone else\u2019s role appear credible. If a role is discredited or someone misunderstands a role, that is when embarrassment occurs. All our different interactions and performances are unique, which requires us to work together to validate everyone\u2019s roles and ensure a smooth performance.\n\tThis idea of validating roles and preventing embarrassment is one of the biggest factors that affected my experience playing softball in high school. As I got older and throughout my time in high school, I changed as a person, which ultimately meant my role in softball should change accordingly. However, this change did not occur. When I was at softball, I had tried a few times to change my role and become the outgoing person I was outside of practice. I quickly realized two different things were happening that were combining to prevent me from really stepping into my new role at softball. The first was that my own fear of embarrassment was preventing me from continuing to try to be myself at practice. I was worried that because I had held a certain role for so long, that my new role would be discredited, leading to me becoming embarrassed. The second thing I noticed was that the other people involved weren\u2019t letting me change my role within the context of softball. My teammates had also grown to expect a certain role from me and changing their understanding of my role could have caused an overall misunderstanding and embarrassment. Because of this, it was easier for them to trap me in a certain role rather than take the risk of allowing a new role and potentially creating a problem in the overall situation. \nSince my teammates weren\u2019t open to change, I was unable to shift into a new role. Our group collectively defined my personal role in our overall performance, which in turn prevented change in that performance from occurring. My personal example from softball is just one of many instances where society has made it difficult for change to occur. Considering Goffman\u2019s idea that the self is collectively produced, it is essential that everyone involved in a certain situation allows for change to occur. Thinking about larger issues in our society such as racism and gender bias, it is clear that change has been difficult and prolonged. For example, racism has always been evident in the United States. Even though we have progressed to abolish slavery and grant rights to African Americans, they still face oppression and injustices in everyday life. Not everyone in society is open to a change in roles for minority groups which makes it extremely challenging for any change to occur. Despite a number of people being open to change, and even fighting in favor of it, if everyone involved is not fully invested in these changing roles, problems will arise. It is very common in our world today for us to collectively prevent someone\u2019s role from changing in order to avoid any possibility of embarrassment or overall problems in the social setting. If, as a society we want significant change to occur, we must first understand that our social interactions have a significant impact on our own self-identity. We must learn how our own actions and beliefs influence how others feel and act when we are with them. Continuing to prevent others from changing their role will stop any sort of progress or change from occurring in our society. ",

        "text": "\t\nIf we all took a minute and thought back to what our high school cafeterias looked like, I fully believe we would all be seeing the exact same patterns. I remember the first time I stepped foot in the cafeteria at my high school. There were about three hundred or so students there, and they were all grouped off. I noticed that there was not much integration; the black people were sitting with other black people, Latinos were sitting with other Latinos, and the white people were sitting with other white people. Of course, there were some outliers, but this was the most common theme. These outliers were generally the mixed-race kids who did not fit the exact mold anywhere. They kind of broke this pattern and would sit with whomever they wanted. I immediately began to wonder why it was like this. My school was centered in a large district filled with diversity; it pulled kids from the wealthiest parts of town to the poorest parts and every other socioeconomic status. This puzzled me and made me wonder why people feel the need to segregate themselves and have these tendencies that seem racist even when they themselves are not racist?\nIn society, race has always been a topic that lots of people try to stay away from in order to not offend anyone. While in actuality, race is a very interesting and complex topic that has influenced society as we know it. If you look like me you have probably always been asked the question, where are you from?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you mixed with?\u201d and after a while, you just start to expect it. I think the reason that people always ask this is because of a concept called ethnocentrism: people who look and have similar cultures to each other tend to stick together. So when people don\u2019t quite fit into a set group, they get questioned about it a lot, so others can know how or if they can relate to them.\n\tAs I stated earlier, the best example of this theory would be a school cafeteria, which is the epitome of ethnocentrism. If you look closely, most of the time the cafeteria will be split into about three or four groups, but there will be a few outliers (like myself) who will sit with any group. The African American kids will usually all sit together on one side, along with the Hispanics and Latinos. Then there are the white kids who would all sit together, but the last group, which is not always there, is the group of people of all different races sitting together. Which brings up the question: What has changed in these kids to value friendships over staying with the people who look similar to them?\n\tAre children raised to value people and to judge off of character instead of judging by skin tone or by appearances? Or do people just like to stick with what they know? This inherent quality that humans have of making a tribe of similar people can be broken if they are taught that everyone is equal, and instead of sticking with people that look like you, you should surround yourself with diversity. This way you can learn as much as you can about other people\u2019s cultures and values. This also brings me to believe that, while humans naturally want to be with people who are familiar, the idea of racism and that another race could be inferior to you is completely a taught or learned behavior. If you allow children to choose for themselves, without the influence of their parents, they will most likely choose to be inclusive and just judge people based on their character.\n\tEven though racism is taught, the people who spread this concept capitalize from the nature of humans to be afraid or leery of things that are different. While this mechanism probably developed into humans as a safety precaution for our ancestors to stay away from poisonous food and dangerous predators, it has evolved as an excuse to explain away hatred, or the fear of the unknown. Some people try to twist the minds of ignorant and uneducated people to convince them to hate what they hate, and they have a few different methods of doing so. They may try to relate it to something that they value highly, like their religion, or something that favored their particular group, like slavery in the south. They may even try to disguise their hatred as love (possibly backed up by the Bible). Even though this does not happen as much today, people still believe that other races are inferior. This is a twisted cycle, because the more racist parents there are, the more people are passing those toxic beliefs down to their children who will continue to facilitate hate in our society. I believe this cycle is slowly starting to break, because today the idea of stopping hate and being an anti-racist is running ramped through big cities, and people are finally being educated and taught that everyone is equal and that no one person is better than another.\n\tEven with our society starting to make little changes and trying to teach people that everyone is equal, it is a very slow process that takes even longer the further south you venture in the United States. It has historically always been this way, because it takes longer to change the minds of southern people (as they are more likely to still be reaping the rewards of slavery and continued racism both financially and socially). It is also due to modern black diaspora out of the south, as this further facilitates ethnocentric rituals and behaviors in the south that have long been removed from other states which are more diverse. This is why I think that anti-racism literature and teachings should not only be included, but mandated in all school curriculums (especially in the south) due to the lack of education on those subjects. Children in public schools should be learning exactly how this nation came to be, and there needs to be an end to white-washing textbooks and only giving little pieces of the truth. The fact that there are still people who are currently trying to block out and ignore the parts of their history that makes them look bad or show the true colors of the leaders of their states is beyond concerning. A famous quote by Winston Churchhill states, \u201cThose who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d This reinforces my belief that if you do not teach about what happened in the past, it can and will eventually, happen again.\n\tSociologists have conducted multiple studies regarding racism and racist behaviors and more recently they have studied ethnocentrism in relation to those ideologies. This term was supposedly coined by Polish sociologist, Ludwig Gumplowicz, in the nineteenth century and the term ethnocentrism derives from two Greek words: \"ethno,\u201d meaning culture, and \"kentron,\u201d meaning center, that basically explains that individual human beings put their culture at the center of their own world view. People who heavily lean into this theory see all of these other cultures and people through their biased view and firmly believe that their culture is the \u201ccorrect\u201d way. Ethnocentric people see other cultures through a warped lens which can make them believe that they are better and other cultures are less than. This is dangerous, as it can cause them to see people of other cultures as wrong, bad, or less human. This increases the chances of justifying the dehumanization of specific cultures that are different, and they may try to exploit them or even defend or perpetuate violence. This goes hand in hand with the study of racism. They are very similar on the surface, but the biggest difference between the two is that racism is taught and ethnocentrism is more of a natural instinct. Everyone is born with some degree of ethnocentrism, considering the fact that when most people are adolescents their day-to-day routines and meals rely heavily on their parents\u2019 customs. It is only natural to become used to and even prefer the things you grew up with, but growth is all about learning that just because it is the most comfortable or preferred for you, does not make it the best overall. As long as people are able to respect other people\u2019s customs and learn to appreciate their differences, ethnocentrism is not a bad thing.  However, I also believe that it can get more extreme if you are surrounded by other, like-minded people, who feed into those thoughts and switch from thinking, \u201cI like this way\u201d to \u201cThis is the best and only way people should do this.\u201d That mindset just reinforces those thoughts and behaviors, so eventually, ethnocentrism could turn into racism if you are surrounded by those ideals and taught that it is okay.\n\tThis brings me back to my original point, the reason people tend to segregate themselves, and the reason that people are always so curious about what race others are, is because they are looking to see what they have in common with them. This is ethnocentrism: the mechanism that makes people want to be with people that are similar to them in either looks or culture or both. This is normally cultivated during childhood, and kids learn to seek out people who look like their parents because they associate that look with safety. When they are first introduced to people of other races it can be a shock to them; one exception to this is mixed-race people. Usually, mixed-race people have something in common with everyone, so they can bypass the ethnocentric views of others by relating to them in some way. Whether it is being a part of the same race or of the same culture as them, mixed-race people have found a loophole where they have adapted to relate to everyone in some way or another. Other people feel like they can relate to them on a personal level, and they do not have their guard up around them like they might with others. This is because people see mixed-race people as somewhat familiar and have common interests or hobbies. On the other hand, if someone of a different race tried to connect with someone else like a mixed person does, they could be met with either hostility or just be blatantly ignored. People instantly have their guard up with people of another race or culture because they automatically think that they are different, while if they would just see people as people and ignore race and color they would probably have more in common with others than they think.\n\t\n\t\n \n\t",

        "text": "11.29.2021\nSOC 105-001\nReligion and its Effects on the Formation of Society and Politics \n\tReligion has always been a topic that is dangerous; whoever you are talking with, you are always walking on ice. Whether you are religious or not, everyone has been involved or witnessed religious-like interactions; decisions, confessions, lifestyle, etc. In attempts to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d of religion in physiological aspects, Maryanksi and Turner discuss the changes in parts of the brain that in turn enhance emotional intelligence. In support of Maryanski and Turner, Durkheim connects religion to the origins of social institutions - through emotional application - and the cultural logic of collective representation. Harari discusses the role of religion in policy making and whether or not it should be a relevant factor to politics. The following is going to show the logistics behind authors and how their ideals can be compared and contrasted. \n\tStarting off with Maryanski and Turner, the neurological differences were spotted within apes. What Turner and Maryanski concluded was that the Morotopithecus apes were more socially advanced due to the expansion of emotion centers of the brain and the postcranial skeleton. The postcranial skeleton allowed the adaptation for hanging and propelling the body, furthering social organization when food was needed. Those with low sociality didn\u2019t organize with other apes, were independent, and considered not a part of a society. Emotions were important for the expansion of cognition due to natural selection eliminating those with smaller emotional centers. The increase in size of the subcortical structures caused an increase in connections within the emotion centers and the neocortex - otherwise known as the prefrontal cortex - where decision making occurs. More importantly, the decisions needed that concerned fight or flight. The amygdala is the part of the brain that controls fight or flight responses, and with an emotional response to a certain stimulus creates memories. By having an apes\u2019 memories enhanced, it created rationality depending on how much emotion was attached to the decision. This expansion of emotions made it possible to read the emotions of others. The ability to read the emotions of others created a language between the apes. With this, a greater capacity for symbolic thought is created and coordination develops between the apes. \n\tContinuing on this emotional intelligence tangent, Durkheim finds similar results as Maryanksi and Turner, but with humans. The emotional application takes place when a certain amount of cognitive capacity (emotional centers) is developed. According to Durkheim, a general concept of the social needs a collective consciousness and representation. When collective consciousness is established within a society, morals and legality are established. When morals and legality is established, then truth and stability are found. Collective representation is created due to a body of people being in agreement or close to agreement enough where everyone feels comfortable with the ideals they\u2019re associated with. \n\tWith Maryanski, Turner, and Durkheim, it can be inferred that religion is created within societies as sort of a union and commonality. Harari established the negatives with religion and how it has controlled policy decisions in history. For instance, different societies idolize and practice different religions in comparison to other societies. This difference in religion creates conflict and makes it more difficult to come to solutions between societies and countries. Over time, solutions have become increasingly difficult to come to due to the flexibility religion has in newer political situations. Harari claims that religion is only helpful with identity problems, in addition to justifying and legitimizing the social order. Identity is based on fixed positions in this hierarchy where there is not much change or movement after your position has been established. Industrial society and group identity concerns the feelings and wants of humans to be a part of the group. Because of this want, societies are only deemed as powerful if they control and manipulate identities. \n\tHarari breaks down 3 problems with religion being involved in politics: technical, policy and identity. Technical problems concern things such as agriculture, world disasters, global warming, etc. This is where religion is seen to cross the line to become medicine. Treatment of these huge problems with religion was popular until technology and science came into play. Now, people are relying more on science instead of religious beliefs. With this Harari revealed his stance by concluding that priests further their presence and validity within politics through more excuses. Harari\u2019s remark on scientists remains positive; evidence can be twisted and trials can fail, but scientists will further experiment in order to find a solution. Policy problems revolve around the measures that should\u2019ve been taken to prevent problems. Examples include actions to prevent global warming before the effects are irreversible, being prepared for natural disasters, etc. Identity problems represent the lack of consideration and perspective to others due to selfishness. In addition, identity problems include the cognitive dissonance of being considerate of others or to be selfish. \nThe ideals of unity and how unity is formed explained by Durkheim, Turner, and Maryanski can be compared to the political ideals of unity expressed by Harari. For instance, Durkheim explains that when collective consciousness is created, morals and legality - along with trust and stability - are established. This association of morals and legality goes in hand with how religion is included in policy making. Morals and legality creates a base to which each country is run politically. Different morals between societies make it harder to come to solutions.\nSimilar to Harari, Turner and Maryanski determine that expanded emotional centers create language and a bond between apes in a societal form. Due to this emotional expansion established, it can be connected to how religion can control and manipulate identities expressed by Harari. If there is an emotional attachment to a symbol, a government can use that symbol as a reason for a policy to be or not to be enacted. When that reason is used, the society that revolves around that religious symbol is automatically manipulated to agree with that decision due to prior beliefs and identity. \n\tAs easy as these concepts can be compared, they can also be contrasted. For instance, Durkheim, Turner, and Maryanski have a very positive or an intriguing outlook when it comes to societal formation surrounding emotional attachments and religion. The neurological aspects made societal formations seem fascinating and applauded for. The enhancement of emotional intelligence aided in the formations of common ideologies and morals. On the other hand, Harari views this as a very negative thing. Harari believes that unity and identity is why there are little to no solutions between societies because of their beliefs. Harari describes the 3 problems with religion that have a negative influence on politics. How identity found within one country aids with being inconsiderate of other countries and a lack of unity. How the problems affecting the world such as climate change, are being handled with traditional and religious beliefs as opposed to science. \n\tIn conclusion, religion can be found as both a positive and negative influence on society in many different forms. Maryanski, Turner, and Durkheim portray more of the positive and scientific reasoning for why the results of unity and commonality support society. The discovery of emotional attachments to symbols - the spark of religion - and which parts of the brain interacted in order to create languages. In other perspectives, Harari shows how it can be detrimental as a global population and how independent and limiting religion can be towards political ideals and how countries are running today. Because of both of these stances on religion, it is why there is such a feeling of walking on ice whenever it is discussed. \n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105-006\n05/02/2022\nInequality under America\u2019s Class System\nIs an NFL Quarterback more valuable than a paramedic saving lives? While the impulse reaction for most would be to claim the paramedic is more important, looking at wages tells a different story. In fact, compared to a North Carolina paramedic averaging $38,270 per year, the NFL\u2019s top 10 quarterbacks earn an average of $33.5 million per year, a whopping 875 times that of the average paramedic. Despite paramedics providing life saving service, judged in the terms of capitalism, they are approximately 875 times less important than the stars on the television screen. Is this fair? These two roles and their disparity in wealth and power provide a clear example of the class system. In America, the class system provides too much power and control to those at the top while leaving barely anything left for those below them.\nThe disparity in power and wealth in America\u2019s class system is not exclusive to the comparison of professional athletes and medical workers. Growing up, I\u2019ve witnessed and experienced the pitfalls of the class system firsthand. I was raised in a family that would probably be most closely defined as lower middle class, and both of my parents worked very hard. My dad worked as a mechanic doing serious physical labor every day, and my mom worked late hours as a nurse. Despite all their hard work, this was still only enough to provide the necessities to our family, which I\u2019m very grateful for. I have had to take out loans for college and I hope to pay them off as soon as I can after graduation.\nWitnessing my mom come home on weekends past 2 am and dad clearly exhausted after every shift left a strong impression on me. While our financial situation wasn\u2019t strong, the effort they put into their jobs was admirable. I know I\u2019m not alone in this struggle, as I have friends who relate. Many of the families in my community struggled to make ends meet, and as a kid we were never able to splurge on lavish vacations or cars like our fellow classmates. I am super appreciative of my parents\u2019 hard work, but my family\u2019s situation has been a strong indicator of a major issue with America\u2019s class system.\nSeeing how hard my parents worked and how little return on their labor was given was frustrating, to say the least, and inevitably made me somewhat bitter towards the class system in America. Ever since I was a kid, the American Dream has always been preached to me, promising infinite possibilities if I work hard. The longer I\u2019ve lived though, the more I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s those at the top who have the greatest freedom and power. Wealthy \u201csuper-celebrities\u201d like Mark Zuckerburg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos are frequently on the news, announcing new acquisitions, ventures, or even going to space. Measuring income, the richest 0.1% earn 196 times as much as the bottom 90%(inequality.org, 2020). These elite and their counterparts have so much power, as well as financial and informational control, that their continued domination seems unavoidable.\nWilliam Domhoff discusses the class system, specifically the class-domination theory of power in his article. Those at the top of the class system, as referenced in my experiences, are referred to by Domhoff as the social upper class. Within the upper class, leaders of subgroups in this category are referred to as the \u201cpower elite\u201d. These power elites are able to ensure their continued domination in America by controlling the organizations they lead to benefit themselves. This level of control is one of the ways the upper class maintain their place and continue to oppress the working class in America. \nIn addition to control over businesses and organization from Domhoff\u2019s power elite, another way they have control over the country is through the government. Those in the top of the class system have tremendous funding and resources to push policies beneficial to themselves through lobbying, gifts, and promises. While heavily frowned upon, this practice is very successful at implementing the upper class\u2019s ideal policies into the government. When rules and structures are put into place that keep power in the elite\u2019s hands, all lower classes suffer as a result. \nThrough these strategies the power elite Domhoff describes employ, it\u2019s clear why inequality is only rising in America, and why it\u2019s so prevalent. Families like mine can work very hard, but will simply never have the tools or control to prosper like the upper class does. While any level of success requires effort, the disparity in wealth in America is not even remotely about who\u2019s working harder. Under the current class system in America, unfairness and mass inequality is an inevitable outcome that will oppress anyone not on top.\nAnother topic Domhoff discusses is the weakness of the working class in America. The working class make up a vast majority of the country\u2019s population, yet have relatively little power. Domhoff notes that historically, despite the country making lots of social progress, including civil rights, feminism, and support for the lgbt community, the power of the working class has regressed. In fact, between 1962 and 1990, the ratio of business executive pay to that of their workers skyrocketed from 41 to 1 to 300 to 1. While many factors influence policy in the United States, the working class simply is overmatched in terms of finance. In America, those with the money have the resources to keep it. The working class has to make ends meet with their small share, and often there is little remaining after necessities are purchased.\nWhile some inequality is a healthy part of any economy, I believe that the degree America has reached under the class system has crossed a line. The top 1% making more than a hundred times that of the bottom 90% reflects the two ends of a spectrum, where some don\u2019t have enough things to buy, while many families including mine struggle with bare necessities. \nIn the case of NFL Quarterbacks making tens of millions of dollars, they very quickly find themselves in the top tier of the upper class. They can then use this money to invest and build even greater wealth. On the other end of the spectrum, paramedics are being worked to death and likely barely make enough to survive. While the professional athlete isn\u2019t necessarily working harder, or striving towards the American dream any more than the paramedic, the two occupations provide two opposite outcomes in terms of compensation. Under the American class system, the gap between these two workers will only grow with each consecutive year.\nThe 875 to 1 ratio between NFL quarterbacks and paramedics provide just one example of wealth disparity in America. The class system in America creates unfair income inequality that keeps the top living lucrative lives while the working class struggles to make ends meet. As long as the class system still exists in the way it currently operates, quality of life for families like mine will continue to be very poor. I think that it\u2019s impossible to eliminate all inequality, but we can make changes to allow the working class to be able to work for improvement, and make the upper class play by the rules instead of controlling the entire country. Overall, while taking down the class system is a daunting task, it\u2019s clear America needs to change in order for it to truly be the land of the free. \n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nInequality.org.

Both Durkheim and the Lore podcast explain that societies are built on common beliefs which help create the collective consciousness. According to Durkheim, religion is essentially social and according to Lore superstition brought the community together. Evidently, factors like these are influential enough to strongly glue a community together and add to the creation of the collective consciousness.    ",

        "text": "Different Views On Class In America\n\tHarari also said that, \u201cfor every job Artificial Intelligence takes from humans, it creates one new job in its place.\u201d While in the past this may have been true and exciting for \u201crobots\u201d to take the boring jobs to allow humans to focus on more important jobs. In reality, with how far technology has progressed, the future could look much different than we previously thought. Technology could take millions or billions of jobs from people leaving a new useless and jobless class. This new class could cause major financial problems not only for itself, but for the government that now has to support this new class of people. This situation would be one of the most expensive things that our government would have had to deal with in a very long time. Depending on how this potential situation is handled will determine the future of America and its people. \nHarari also says that there are some potential solutions to prevent job loss. While stopping the loss of jobs altogether is almost impossible, if it were to happen, we would lose the possibility of AI filled jobs that could help humanity. He says, \u201cAlthough just because something can be done does not mean that it must be done.\u201d So governments may choose to integrate AI slowly to lessen the effect that it will have on people that lose their jobs and this will also give the government an opportunity to try and create new jobs to make up for the ones that were lost. In this situation, humans will not be needed as producers or consumers because AI would be producing everything that the economy needs. They would not be needed as consumers because the American economy would evolve to not need the consumption of its citizens. If nothing is done to prepare for the time when AI is introduced it could be catastrophic. One solution for this model that Harari discussed is not meant to protect jobs, but to protect humans themselves; he called this UBI (universal basic income). The government would tax both the extremely wealthy individuals and corporations to provide a stipend for people who may need it to cover their basic needs. The other option is UBS (universal basic services) where the government would pay a certain group of people who would go and provide necessary services to citizens who need them. They would do things such as child care, caring for the elderly, cooking etcetera. The usefulness of UBI and UBS is a hot topic in America because those systems are very similar to Communism and Socialism, which America has been conditioned to not like. \n\tHarari believes that the lower class in America has little to no power in the decisions that are made in the country. There are many reasons for this imbalance including that the rich and powerful do everything in their power to manipulate the system to create the illusion of choice for the lower class. Some of the ways that are used to facilitate this illusion of choice are gerrymandering and the electoral college so the individual\u2019s vote counts for very little overall. Most of the choices that are made for this country are heavily influenced by a minority of people with the majority of the wealth. This is very unfair for the rest of the people in this country that are middle or low class whose vote becomes meaningless in the big picture.\nMantsios has quite a different view on class than Harari, the main difference is the fact that Mantsios is more focused on the present and how the class system is now, while Harari is centered on what the class system will turn into in the coming years. Mantsios believes that there are four main myths about the class system in America. The first myth is the thought that America is a classless society and people can move between classes freely. The second myth is that everyone in America is middle class, while the majority of Americans are middle class, there is a huge leap between the bottom of the middle class and the top. A family that makes three hundred thousand dollars a year is considered middle class, but so is the family that makes sixty thousand dollars a year. The third myth is that everything one has, has come from smarts or hard work. This is false, as America is the epitome of \u201cold\u201d money because America has had a huge economic boom in the last two hundred years that has produced generational wealth. Individual people and/or families that experienced that economic boom had a big influx of cash, which they used to establish themselves.  This \u201cfound\u201d wealth led to things like buying lots of land or to running a successful business that generated even more money. So the people with a family that established themselves early in America, on average, became very wealthy. This inherited wealth got passed down for many generations which essentially gave those select people a head start. This phenomenon is referred to as generational wealth. The last myth that Mantsios discusses is that the economy is growing for everyone. Realistically, the economy is influenced most by other countries and the very wealthy people in America, who know how to use the economy and society to their advantage, in turn making themselves even more money.\nDomhoff has a theory that there are people who control and have great influence over the economy. These people are referred to as the power elite; the power elite is the top of the social upper class. This group includes CEOs, boards of directors, and the board of trustees of banks and large companies. These select few have a significant amount of power in the United States because they are the group with the most economic sway due to the mass amount of capital their positions control. The power of this elite group is that they have congruent class consciousness. They actively work to splinter the potential for any polarizing class consciousness to form. So if another person or group is spreading ideas that the powerful don\u2019t agree with, they will do everything in their power to stop them from spreading their ideals. This is done through media, movies, TV, and commercials; they portray the world through presumptions of the elites that actively defund projects that may challenge their main view. They also have most media outlets under their influence so they perpetuate their ideas even further. In addition, there is a very clear policy that they follow which is anti-tax, anti-union, and anti-workers rights. This group also supports deregulation so that they can do as they please without having any restrictions.\nSocial and financial class is a very complex subject and can be hard to understand. Although these three authors have a deep understanding of society and class they present some very profound ideas about what it needs or what might happen in the future, they agree that there are many detrimental flaws within the class system in America. Harari believes that this class system can not withstand the current rate of technology innovation. Classes will not be stable in the future without preparation beforehand and the creation of a cushion for the people who will need it. Mantsios instead focuses on the wage disparity within the class system, especially the middle class. Being the biggest class in America, there are \u201cmiddle class\u201d people that vacation outside of the country seasonally and send their kids to private schools and ivy league colleges. While people in this same \u201cmiddle class\u201d have never even been out of their home state or town and have to work on the holidays just to keep food on the table for their families. It is not justifiable to have such disparity between people in supposedly the same class. On the other hand, Domhoff centers on the fact that classes and society are controlled by the power elite. His other main point is the fact that the working class and the \u201cnormal\u201d American citizen has little to no power in the say of things that happen in the United States.  Overall, these three authors offer thoughtful insight into the very complex and intricate society in which we all live.  Taken together as a study for positive social and economic change, there is great value in moving toward a future that considers each viewpoint.",

        "text": "30 November 2021\nSociology 101\nPower in America According to Doffhom vs Harari\n\tIn any type of society, as learned through studying Sociology over the course of this semester, there is a hierarchy of power. In each society, the roles and functions of the so-called \u201cpower elite\u201d differ, but the concept of power remains the same. Regardless of the time period, race, gender, or age, each individual experiences the effects of the \u201cpower elite\u201d. This statement is proven by the works of Doffhom and Harari, as each describes what power looks like in different time periods and how power is established. While both authors discuss the same initial topic, the smaller factors that make up their individual definitions of power are described in different ways. Doffhom describes the \u201cpower elite\u201d in America as the upper class that consists of active workers for-profit or nonprofit organizations while Harari argues that big corporations are continuously increasing in power, and will hold the most power over America in the near future. \n\tEach author discusses the concept of power in different ways. In Doffhom\u2019s argument, he describes political power of the elites over the lower class members of society, while Harari discusses the technological power that big corporations hold over the rest of society. The \u201cpower elites\u201d are able to work their way into the government through their social and economic status, which allows them to make decisions for the country that directly contributes to their socioeconomic group. Harari explores how big corporations use their technological power to expand their own companies. For example, when Apple releases a new product, people wait outside in extreme temperatures for extended amounts of time hoping to be the first to snag the new iPhone. There are videos of customers trampling each other to get inside the building to spend a pretty penny on a device not much different from the last one. The ability to control hundreds of thousands of people with the release of a new product is baffling, and Harari explores how this type of situation is only the beginning of big corporations using their power to advance society in a way that benefits them. \n\tDoffhom\u2019s argument is focused around the upper class, \u201csnobby\u201d individuals that have money and a strong educational background. This elite group consists of CEOs, socialites, and executives that execute their power in the government. Although it seems that the government would have more control than a group of \u201cdaddy\u2019s money Harvard alumni\u201d, these individuals are able to intertwine themselves in the government system by becoming lawyers, judges, and even friends of individuals inside the government, and are able to tip the hat in a direction that directly benefits the elite group. Even research shows that members of the senate and congress for both political parties consist of members of the elite. Although the government claims to be \u201cfor the people, by the people\u201d, it truly is to benefit the elite, by the elite. By tricking citizens to believe they are choosing who goes into office, what decisions are made, and more, citizens willingly give up their power, and hand it to the elite. \nHarari argues that the advancement of technology has allowed large companies to create an unspoken power of the citizens of America due to the fact that they are the most technologically advanced, and Americans have become obsessed with the new advancements granted by the creation of new algorithms. These algorithms essentially force individuals to give up their ability to make their own choices and allow AI to begin possessing the power of decision-making. Now more than ever, technology is advancing at a rapid pace, which in return, allows companies to make these large leaps towards an AI-centered lifestyle. Harari discusses how these corporations creating AI models of doctors and homes are removing the concept of free will from the lives of Americans. By interacting with these new forms of technology, Americans cannot be certain how much power is truly being stolen. As interaction with AI increases, the more that these models learn about individuals, and over time, will replace the individuals\u2019 own conscious and begin making decisions for them. For example, Harari discusses how AI will eventually take over most jobs in society, ranging from cashiers to doctors. With no jobs available, individuals are forced into using their time doing other activities, however, this decision was not based upon free will, but technically, by force. Although having an AI model in homes or workplaces has it benefits, the more closely that individuals interact with these models, the more the models are able to learn about human consciousness, giving them more information to modify themselves, and essentially, know humanity more than humanity knows itself. \nIn both scenarios, the lower class citizens are being robbed of their own sense of free will, and are being controlled by whoever is in power. The concept of power is not something that can be eliminated in society, as it is an essential factor for advancement, however, as the power is continuously being granted to the elite groups, the more they are able to advance. This is a vicious cycle that is almost impossible to escape, and the lower class groups are unaware of how they are fueling this hierarchy of power. \nAnother obvious difference between the two author\u2019s arguments about power is that Doffhom discusses how the government and corporations (and or business owners) are divided, while Harari explores how technological advancements could possibly grant corporations all the power, or that they could work together with the government as a unit. Doffham explores how many business leaders feel powerless in the face of the government, and how they feel unheard. There is an obvious rift between political leaders and business leaders, which fuels the government even more, because members are aware of how other groups feel threatened by the government. On the other hand, Harari explores how corporations and the government could possibly work hand in hand. Because AI is expected to take over many jobs in the future, it is not surprising that the government could potentially be controlled by AI models, which are controlled by big corporations, furthermore, gaining more power for these said corporations. By implementing AI in every aspect of individuals lives, the corporations that create them will gain power exponentially until houses, cars, and even individuals\u2019 thoughts are controlled, monitored, and used for further advancements. \nAlthough both situations from each author is different, individuals are still trapped in the cycle that is power in America. Doffhom describes how socialites are able to sneak their way into government, but this process happens very publicly, and the people still believe that it is their decision. For example, by electing Donald Trump as President of the United States, the people believed they were making this choice, while in reality, Trump was already an individual of high status with the financial stability and connections that already included him somewhat in politics. Electing him as President was merely the last step to the plan to include the elites in the government. Soon after, it was released that Trump had elected some of his personal friends to serve in different areas of government, which supports Doffhom\u2019s argument. \nBoth Doffhom and Harari discuss how power allows individuals to believe they are making decisions for themselves, but in reality, individuals are forced to make a certain decision that has been provided by the ones in control. As Doffhom explains in his work, many members of the \u201cpower elite\u201d are able to run for political office due to their connections and status. When the ballet is provided during the election season, Americans are able to choose between several different options of candidates, and between more than two political parties. However, each individual is typically one of these \u201cpower elites\u201d, and therefore, the decision has already been made. An example of this is that every few years, Apple products begin to become glitchy and suddenly stop working. However, this typically occurs during two different events; either there was just a new software update or a new product is soon being released. Apple is able to force their users to buy new products when their old ones stop working. This is not by coincidence, but by the fact that Apple is such a large and successful company that it\u2019s customers do not mind buying the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d product that they are offering. \nRegardless of time period, the hierarchy of power exists in any sort of functioning society. Doffhom and Harari show how generalizable the concept of power is in society, and provides two different examples of how power can be created and exerted upon the individuals not included in the group with power. Doffhom explains how the \u201cpower elites\u201d have their power due to their wealth and status, and are able to exert this power by either becoming CEOs or members of the government, where they exert their power to benefit themselves. Harari discusses how big corporations are currently the most powerful due to their access to technological advances, and how the world will be effected by these new algorithms. While companies like Apple and Microsoft are now the most current technological \u201ccrazes\u201d in the world, every day they are modifying these products to become better and better, which will result in these companies having the power to control every aspect of an individual\u2019s life. With the rise of smart homes and talks of robots delivering UPS packages to front doors, I have no doubt in my mind that within 30 years, AI will have almost completely taken over inside the workplace. There will be Siri like robots that talk through devices catching people shoplifting, or diagnosing someone with cancer. There is a possibility as well that the concept of power will shift away from technology and towards another concept. Regardless of how it is presented and exerted, the concept of power will remain the same throughout any society. ",

        "text": "0172\nWomen In the Workplace\nWill Men ever see Women as their Equals? Women have been making significant strides to balance workplace inequalities, as we will always deal with the fact that Men will always be paid more. The top female dominated professions are relating to childcare or aiding a medical professional. The fact that many top female-dominated professions are related to childcare or medical aid is certainly interesting, and it speaks to the societal expectations placed on women to be caregivers. Men will continue to see Women as the \u201cother sex\u201d as they consider themselves to be alpha in the workplace and will promote the ideology of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d how women should act, dress, work, take care of the children, etc.\nIn the workplace, women are frequently under pressure to conform to specific beauty norms, such as being slender, having flawless skin, and donning cosmetics. This can pose a major obstacle since they may believe that meeting these criteria is essential to earning respect or climbing the career ladder. Furthermore, promoting the idea of the \"beauty myth\" can result in women being objectified and seen as desirable objects, rather than multifaceted individuals with distinct viewpoints and innovative concepts.\nI have worked many small part-time jobs, ice cream scooper, server, babysitter, volleyball coach, feed shop warehouse worker, farm hand, and most recently a metal worker for a golf company. I never really thought much about my past work experiences and specific interactions I had, but after reading the beauty myth and the article about othering I quickly reflected and understood what was happening and how it was playing into my life. I was sixteen at the time and had applied for a part time job at a local feed store as a warehouse hand. I was raised on Black Angus Family Farm, so I am used to labor intensive jobs, and throwing feed bags and hay bales. Upon turning my application into the owner of the feed store who was a middle-aged man, he quickly questioned me and asked me if I meant to apply for the warehouse position. I told him yes, that I was a farm hand, and I would prefer that to be opposed to being behind a counter all day. He in turn asked me if I could lift a feed bag; I demonstrated by lifting a 75-pound bag of grass seed. The owner simply just smiled at me and said I would look better behind the counter and unless I worked the counter, he would not offer me a job because the warehouse is for men, and it would not be right to have a \u201clittle girl\u201d back there. \nI faced a similar challenge when I worked in the metals department of a golf company where I was the only female among male colleagues. During my interview, they asked if I was okay with getting my hands dirty and emphasized that the job required physical labor. Despite this, I was hired. Working there opened my eyes to how men think and talk about women, sometimes as objects or in ways I never imagined. For instance, while washing a metal pan, a colleague told me to stay in the kitchen because that is where I belonged, and to come in only when the real work was done, so I could clean up the mess, and that I look too good to be doing dirty work. Recently, we had a project with 650 metal ball markers, I completed three in the time it took my male colleagues to finish one. They make jokes about needing to give me directions on where to drop off shipments, even asking if they needed to draw me a map, because they know women are dictionally challenged. I am even reminded of how to do basic tasks I perform every day by my supervisor. Despite their belittling comments, I know my worth and am confident in my abilities.\nThe feed store experience highlights the issue of othering and gender discrimination in the workplace. My gender was the store owners only grab. He made assumptions about my abilities and suitability for the job. The owner actively stereotyped me and made assumptions about women's competence and value in the workplace. After reading Naomi Wolfs \u201cThe beauty Myth\u201d which says that women are constantly pressured to conform to narrow and unrealistic standards of beauty, it made me reflect on these experiences, which can have negative effects on our self-esteem, health, and overall well-being. This myth is perpetuated by various industries, including fashion, beauty, and media, and serves to reinforce gender inequality by objectifying women and limiting their opportunities in society.\nThe concepts that I connected to these puzzles are othering and the beauty myth. Othering is the social concept of viewing or treating people or groups are different or less valuable than oneself or one's own group. Othering This can lead to people diminishing or belittling other groups and people, simply just because they are different. Othering can happen due to differences of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion, and many other characteristics. Othering contributes to social inequities and is a form of discrimination. The beauty myth is the idea that women are frequently under pressure to conform to specific beauty norms, such as being slender, having flawless skin, and donning cosmetics, just to achieve proper status in society. These concepts relate to my work experiences because the experiences described in both examples relate to the beauty myth and othering because they prove how society has constructed certain gender roles and expectations that limit women's opportunities and potential.\nIn my first puzzle the feed store owner assumed that I could not handle the physical demands of the job simply because of my gender, and even denied me of the job because I am woman. I am other, despite my experience. He told me that I \u201cwould look better behind the counter.\u201d This is an example of the beauty myth limiting opportunities for women such as myself and othering me as weaker or less capable than men in physical labor.\nIn my second puzzle, my male colleagues at the golf company treated me the only female employee differently, making sexist comments and belittling my abilities, even when I proved that I was capable and efficient in my work. This is another example of othering and the beauty myth, as the men in this case saw the me as an outsider, an object to be looked at or a lower-class worker, rather than an equal colleague with skills and abilities.\nThe problem with othering and the beauty myth is that it is deeply ingrained in our society and in the way we view others. These concepts also play a role in how we view and value each other in the workplace. Even though women have come a long way in society in terms of equal opportunity and rights, we are still not valued or view the same way men are when it comes to the workplace. Society has beliefs and stereotypes that women are not capable of doing labor intensive jobs. \nThe beauty myth reinforces the idea that the value of a women lies in their physical appearance, regardless of their skill, intelligence, or abilities. The myth also holds the idea that women should be \u201cseen and not heard.\u201d  The myth is reflected by social media, advertising, pop culture, because all of these portray women as objects for men's desire, rather than personal individuals, with interests, skills, intelligence, and personalities.\nAs you can see from my personal experience women that choose to pursue a career in male dominated fields, will often be subjected to discrimination, harassment, and stereotyping. In my experience I was denied a job opportunity because I was the \u201cother\u201d sex, so women might be subjected to loss job opportunities, promotions, and we also may be paid less than our male colleagues.\nThe issues of othering and the beauty myth are interconnected, and both contribute to the discrimination and belittling of women in society but especially in the workplace. I hope as a woman one day we will challenge these beliefs and stereotypes to create a more equal workplace for ourselves. I also hope that women who work in male dominated fields know that they are there because of their skills, not their beauty. Worth does not derive from beauty. One day we should have a society where people are valued and respected for themselves regardless of gender or appearance.\n",

        "text": "In our society today we have equated money with power and social standings. The more money one has the higher up they are social class wise, and therefore the more power they possess. This thought process has now created a class system in our society. At its core, the class systems can be broken up into three categories: the upper class, the middle class, and the lower class. In Domhoff\u2019s \u201cPower in America,\u201d the upper class is called the \u201cpower elite\u201d and they control the institutions of authority and all the power in the society. Gregory Mantsios examines the division of the economy in America in her writing titled \u201cClass in America\u201d as he believes the concept of societal classes is pushed under the rug and not payed attention to. \nMantsios believes that classes aren\u2019t discussed because some people choose to ignore the issue and other are just simply ignorant to it. Throughout the literature Mantsios stresses the fact that the gap between the middle and upper class is growing at an alarming rate. It is also said that class differences have a profound impact on the way people live. Differences in class determine where people live, what jobs they have, who they socialize with, and how they are educated. Mantsios also states that class standings are largely determined at birth. This illustrates the fact that class mobility is extremely rare, meaning that the gap between the middle class and upper class is large and can\u2019t be overcome. Overall, people don\u2019t choose to be a part of the middle class, they are confined to the opportunities that society grants or shields from them because of the social class they are a part of. This ideal creates the gap between social classes which creates divisions in our societal. \nDomhoff\u2019s literature focuses on the power elite and how they rule America. Most simply stated, Domhoff believes that the people who have the money hold the most power in society. However, he believes that the power network of the United States is rooted in the economy which means that the CEO\u2019s and big companies of the world yield all the power. Since these institutions hold all the power, the working-class people have the least amount of power. Structure wise, the \u201cupper class\u201d is commonly agreed upon by member of the society to be the \u201ctop\u201d or \u201celite\u201d class, according to Domhoff. Because the social hierarchy gives these people such an exclusive title such members think of themselves as \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d to everyone else. Domhoff also says that \u201cthe rich\u201d come together to develop institutions by which the members children are socialized into an \u201cupper-class worldview.\u201d This concept can be connected to Mantsios\u2019s ideas as both pieces state that people are born into such high classes which shows that people can only go so far with the opportunities they are given. Because the children of the \u201celite\u201d are already born into a higher status they are able to achieve so much more than children of the lower class. This head start allows the higher-class children to stay in the \u201celite\u201d class because they are excelling in their life from the start unlike the children of the lower class.\nThe collective consciousness also creates a concept of the social hierarchy. In this social hierarchy moving between social classes is a more accepted concept than in Domhoff and Mantsios\u2019s writings. The collective consciousness wants people to disregard the thought of having different social class in its entirety. This concept pushes the idea of having no material conditions, like money or job titles, shape one\u2019s class category. The perfect idea is to have everyone believe that class changes are based on individuals\u2019 abilities and not what material items or titles they have. Overall, class structure should be determined by one\u2019s world views, beliefs, and/or values. \nDomhoff and Mantsios believe that the upper class and middle class are separated by a huge gap. People are put into the right class based on their jobs and wealth. It is also thought that people are born into certain social classes and will reside there for life because of the limitations or advantages they receive from their designated class. These thoughts are challenged by the collective consciousness view on social class structure as the consciousness doesn\u2019t believe people are put into different class for the same reasons. The collective consciousness believes that people have the ability to move through the social structure and one\u2019s class position should be based off of them as a person and not their wealth or titles they have.

        "text": "SOC. 105\n10/15/21\t\nRacialization is the top-down political process where a dominant group decides the symbolic values of subordinate groups. In this day and age racialization is higher than ever, with immigrants coming in and the constantly changing society that we live in. This is a downward spiral, as racialization creates a social hierarchy based on skin color and essentially defines people by their race. The concept of systemic racism connects to racialization because with racialization you are defining people by their skin color and creating a hierarchy. Racism is not to be confused with ethnocentrism though, which is the tendency to trust or lean on people in your culture. Because of ethnocentrism, most people have a slight bias toward people of other races and ethnicities, but it is not inherently racialization.\nI grew up near a military base, in a very diverse area, my high school had a minority rate of 62%. Due to the increased diversity of the area, no one really thought about race or classified people based on their race. Through my eyes, there was no dominant group it was all very inclusive. There were some neighborhoods growing up that were more black and some that were more white but it wasn\u2019t to the point where it was dangerous to go there if you were the opposite race. Then I came to UNCW, which is a primarily white institution and it really surprised me how much they lack diversity and some of the stories I have heard from people of color about how they were mistreated and how they feel like an outcast here. It really opened my eyes to how much racialization there is before I never even thought about it because all my childhood everyone came together as one. This made me think, \u201cwhy is systemic racism still so prevalent in our country\u201d\nSystemic racism is caused by many things, first, some believe minorities don\u2019t deserve the same rights because of discriminatory policies. There used to be policies put in place, such as black not being able to own a house any of these policies do exist today but they  s o minorities and now they have the reputation of living in low-income areas . The media representation is another thing still expanding racism, whether it\u2019s a book, movie, or news story, the media tends to represent people of color in a negative light. This causes people to be engrained with the fact that all of them act like that in real life. Even though slavery was abolished on December 18, 1865, there is still underground trafficking going on forcing minorities into labor because the stigma of slavery still exists, that People of color were made to do hard labor.\nThe hierarchy created by racialization causes white to make it out on top as the dominant group and other races to be looked down upon and go through all these challenges just to get where white people are. A lot of white people don\u2019t realize their privilege and in turn, don\u2019t realize how hard other races have it to live everyday life. This lack of acknowledgment only . If white people in power took a step back and realized what was truly going on, they could make some changes, the country does not have to be this way. Of course, you cannot do anything about specific internalized racism among individuals, but we can change policies and fire people who go against them. This is supposed to be a free country for all, yet some people are still fighting for their spot. \nThere are many ways to combat systemic racism in healthcare, the criminal justice system, housing, and politics. It starts within the education system, for medical school, law school, or even a management degree. If we learn how to identify our implicit biases and control them or learn from them,  won\u2019t make it into these systems. The best place to learn this is at the root of the problem when you begin learning the technical things. We can also make set-in-stone changes to public policy and industry  the systemic racism flows all the way into the concrete practices that already exist. Some states opted out of using Medicaid which left 46% of black working adults without some kind of insurance.  Hospitals and physicians could start excepting Medicaid, which is a health insurance that helps people with low-income. Within the criminal justice system, it is important to remain aware of police brutality, this way we can hold the system accountable. Addressing the inequality in the police system and in court settings would eventually lead to change as well. Some ways to stop inequality in the housing industry are investing in segregated communities, create affordable rental housing for low-income families, and increase the opportunities for black homeownership. \nOne of the major reasons a lot of the inequality that is very obvious is not being solved is due to white privilege. White privilege is the privilege white people have in everyday life that they don\u2019t recognize as an advantage. The thing about white privilege is the fact that it causes some whites to be oblivious to the problems other races face. White people have the freedom to walk around in a grocery store without being followed, have a civilized run-in with the police, apply for jobs easily, and many other things. These are things that minorities have a hard time with, they could simply just be grocery shopping with their kids, and someone might suspect them of stealing, solely based on the color of their skin. Many white people aren\u2019t just oblivious, they don\u2019t believe it's real and get mad at those who think it is. The problem with this belief is that we can\u2019t help stop one race from becoming superior to another, thus racialization will continue to grow even more. Of course, having privilege does not mean you don\u2019t have struggles or get discriminated against in other aspects, it simply means you\u2019re struggles are not due to your race. America could be a much better place if we used our white privilege to help others, such as standing up for a minority when it may be more dangerous for them. \nSo why does white privilege exist? The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was supposed to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or nationality. As a country, the Act did help some discrimination, but discrimination of race still strongly persisted. This is when the term \u201cwhite privilege\u201d came about when people started to realize that it was psychological and less of a choice. Sme still believed white privilege was due only to conscious action, which is not inherently true because it is both conscious and unconscious. Some aspects of white privilege are surface deep, and others are embedded in the culture throughout the years. This is why Peggy Macintosh defined it as \u201can invisible knapsack,\u201d it's hard to see and even harder to get rid of. \nIt is important to note that there is a big difference between racism and white privilege. History has caused white privilege to exist, biases exist all throughout time periods. Racism is something you choose to believe, that one race is better than another. It is not true that everyone with white privilege is racist, they interlock whenever one with white privilege does not recognize or rejects the fact that they have it and use it against those of other races. The concept of racialization is embedded in our culture and is also not just about racism, it is about whites being on top throughout history and our culture hasn\u2019t changed. White people hold more wealth, have higher government positions, and gain better opportunities. \nRacialization depends on where you are how extreme it is but it exists everywhere. Even though where I grew up there was not a lot of racism, there was still white privilege so white people were still on top because of their race. This is due to systemic racism in our country, dating all the way back to before 1964 when the thirteenth amendment passed that outlawed slavery. America is known as a free country, everyone, in theory, has the same freedoms but when you combine those with the fear people of other races face of persecution, then everyone is not free. The roots of this country still lie under the fact that white men are on top and until that changes the systemic racism will still be more prevalent than ever. Some things like white privilege you can\u2019t just get rid of after all this time, it will always exist to an extent, but we can recognize it and learn from it. That is the important thing about America\u2019s history, it is not always the best but as a country, we can learn from our mistakes and increase the equality this country holds. So back to the question, why is systemic racism still so prevalent in our country? The answer is simpler than we think, it's because we lean on racialization to help us understand people and why people do things. Unconscious bias and ethnocentrism are rooted not only in our country but in everyone\u2019s minds. That is holding back a change that could occur.\n",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n27 April 2021\nSocial Media and Its Negative Impact on Women \n\n\tSocial media has developed into a widely used platform of communication and connection between individuals around the world. The accessibility to online platforms has allowed for many adolescents and young women to interact with multiple applications that display the cultural norms on the appearance of females. What are the implications of the perception of beauty and body stereotypes? How does this affect individual body image of young women? Social media portrays the cultural norms and expectations that adolescents and young women are expected to maintain in relation to their physical appearance. The constant society pressure placed on women negatively impacts their physically and psychological well being. While social media is a benefit of access to information and quicker communication, it negatively impacts the identity of women on a consistent basis. This paper discusses how social media impacts promotes the standards of physical attractiveness leading to body dissatisfaction, a negative impact on identity, and increases the likelihood of eating disorders. \n\tThe topic of gender is discussed in \u201cThe Beauty Myth,\u201d which seeks to reveal the social expectations for women to be physically beautiful. Wolf explains that female liberation is often hindered by a shift towards a feeling of negativity towards physical appearance. Despite women becoming more successful and gaining power throughout the feminist movements, many still felt hindered by feelings of self hatred and physical obsessions. As these ideas became more prevalent in society and through the development of technology, mass media campaigns created a significant force of societal pressure for women to conform to unrealistic standards. Due to the societal pressure, many women become preoccupied with these expectations, leading to the rise of eating disorders and plastic surgery in order to compete with the unattainable standards set by society. The rise of modern society lead to a display of images depicting how women are desired to look, thereby controlling women through ideals and stereotypes. \n\tThe pressure for women to conform to societal ideals of aesthetics means that there is constantly an expectation that women are forced to achieve. However, this is an unobtainable reality and leads to an attack on a young woman\u2019s sense of self. This leads to dangerous implications in which young women become constantly dissatisfied with their physical appearance and oftentimes leads to drastic measures.  Social media enhances the impact on women\u2019s identity by amplifying the cultural perception of women across all applications such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. Access to these forms has created a whole new world of interactions, except this time it is through a screen. Being behind a screen distorts the reality of the \u201cbeauty\u201d that women are trying to achieve. Societal expectations are amplified because women are conditioned to believe that what is present on the screen is true. While this is oftentimes not the case, women misunderstand that the images on the screen are a distorted sense of reality. Without the understanding that many images presented on social media are often photoshopped or edited, women often believe that they must do what it takes in order to match the image on the screen. \n\tThe idea that \u201cbeauty is pain\u201d leads to the perception in young women to implement extreme measures in order to combat struggles with self-image. These implications often come from examples of mass media that influence women\u2019s perceptions of their own physical appearance. The \u201ccultural icon of female beauty\u201d for adolescents and women is the \u201cBarbie doll\u201d (Dittman 2009). The mass production of a toy often given to young girls represents an image of an ultra-thin woman. This leads to a desire to have a \u201cthin\u201d and perfect ideal body. As an individual continues to grow up, these ideas are amplified through social media depicting images of real-life women who look identical to the doll they once played with as a child. These ideas are also shown in magazines such as Sports Illustrated and Playboy, in which models epitomize the ideal female body shape. These real-world examples often lead to body dissatisfaction and a negative factor in relation to perceived body image. The idea often leads to women projecting negative feelings towards physical attributes of themselves and comparing themselves to peers who resemble these types of mass media images. \n\tAnother impact of body expectations presented through social media is through body image. Women often project a negative self attitude towards their size, shape, and physical aesthetics in relation to the norms presented by society that women are expected to obtain. These emotions are directed by how each woman\u2019s self-perceived physical attributes relate to the negative evaluation of their overall appearance. In relation to the topic of gender, women often are dissatisfied and have a negative body image as they often view themselves as overweight, despite maintaining an average weight level. This perception is discussed in \u201cThe Looking Glass Self,\u201d in which James Cooley describes the idea that how you feel about yourself is based on how you think others perceive you. Through social media, societal norms and expectations often lead to judgements on others that do not match the ideal standard of beauty. As mentioned previously, social media exists as a screen distorting that distorts the realities of life. Since the perceptions of oneself depends on the social context one is in, because social media translates these negative connotations of body image, women feel as though they do not conform to societal norms and therefore have a negative image of themselves. \n\tAnother aspect of social media that creates a negative impact on women\u2019s identity is that apps design feeds that reflect individual preferences specific to each user. This has developed the capacity to bring the user into a new world, separate from reality. Because social media has become personal and sites shape to each individual user, one who is likely to look at models on Instagram is likely going to see those types of images everytime the app is accessed. This leads to an obsessive quality in which the user feels as though they should be engaged with the app constantly and indirectly, creating a negative impact on self worth. In addition, social media involves following peers, acquaintances, and influencers. While seeing models presented with a \u201cperfect\u201d body often leads to women feeling less happy with themselves, however, seeing individuals you know embody the societal norms often has a greater impact on negative self image. Social media has become the domain of peers in which women find it functional to compare themselves to others, likely those they often see in the hallways at school. The idea of comparison in these situations often leads to a negative affect. Everytime one posts on Instagram, yet the post has fewer \u201clikes\u201d  when compared to others, one often feels as though they are not enough which decreases self worth. This leads to a poor perception of self as one sees themselves based on what others might think and leads to destruction in their identity. \nA study conducted in 1997 discussed the idea of a \u201cmodel trap,\u201d which proposed that young girls often compare their physical attractiveness with that of advertising models. Being challenged by unrealistic expectations impacts self-perceptions of physical attractiveness and leads to individuals having a desire to become models. These concepts are often implemented in advertisements and tv commercials that convey the idea that female bodies are considered \u201cobjects\u201d and their physical beauty determines their overall value. This idea is related to three viewpoints in which women find themselves when struggling with body image issues. The first is self evaluation, the judgment of value of one\u2019s abilities and personal traits. Because women consider models to have \u201csuperior\u201d physical attractiveness, one often compares themselves to individuals who are shaped to represent the ideal body image. This directly relates to negative self-perceptions and self-esteem. Secondly, one may focus on self-improvement. This is defined through an individual\u2019s inspiration to better oneself through a particular attribute. Even as a child, individuals often compared themselves to a peer when learning how to perform tasks or reach a certain goal. This translates to women working to reach the same weight as a friend or comparing with others to reach a goal rather than focusing on their individual health and well-being. The last viewpoint is self enhancement, which is an individual's attempt to maintain positive views of oneself to protect self-esteem. These comparisons to others are often made in a downward connotation, meaning that individuals put down others in order to make them feel better about themselves. This is a very negative concept as many individuals often cyberbully others through social media because there is a screen blocking them from the hurtful words displayed. The response of self greatly impacts the extent of the negative nature women feel when they are fighting the battle of body dissatisfaction. \nAnother implication of the effects of social media and its negative impacts on women is the development of eating disorders. While this is not a common result for most women, those who exhibit vulnerable characteristics such as low self-esteem, depression, perfectionism and internalization of physical expectations. This leads to an amplification in the desire to reach the \u201cthin\u201d level of ideal physical characteris. These negative thoughts can potentially lead to eating disorders in which women maintain unhealthy lifestyles hoping that they can reach the ideal body type. This can be found through the refusal to eat and maintain the appropriate body weight for age and height. Others often experience patterns of binging followed by fasting and overexercising to lessen caloric intake. These unhealthy lifestyles often stem from the unrealistic body image type displayed on social media. \nIn conclusion, the online world of social media often influences the self perception of women in terms of physical appearance. As new technology continues to advance, powerful industries have created a massive impact on culture to reinforce these ideas of the \u201cperfect\u201d body. These articles show that \u201cThe Beauty Myth'' explains the underlying relationship of women with societal expectations to be physically beautiful. Throughout history, women have been subjected to a system of beliefs that controls women into maintaining aesthetic qualities that are unobtainable. The role of social media enhances these psychological and physical hardships on women by establishing a force of cultural pressures women have to maintain. Because of these ideals, women are willing to go to extreme measures and even maintain unhealthy lifestyles in order to achieve a \u201cperfect body.\u201d These implications often lead to severe negative effects on women\u2019s mental health and sense of self worth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources \n\nPerloff, R.M.

        "text": "The Effects of Hegemonic Masculinity\n\tIs hegemonic masculinity benefitting society\u2019s youth? While current media and mainstream culture in recent western society are perpetuating the notion or practice of dominant, assertive, strong, and competitive masculine traits; moreover, it brings up the question, how is it affecting society\u2019s youth? There are some in society that tends to belong to a higher social class who have certain racial, societal, gender-based, economic, and other privileges that would state that the messages or teachings of hegemonic masculinity towards the youth bring out breadwinners and overall successful men into functioning society.  In contrast, another side of society states that hegemonic masculinity is destructive to young boys and men because it maintains a toxic form of masculinity that not only affects men negatively but also women. After all, they can become victims of men who have been guided or influenced by the effects of this masculinity.\n           Young men and boys who don\u2019t fit into the direct mold that is placed for the type of man this masculinity maintains, are now put into a category lesser than the \u201cideal man\u201d. I argue that those same men who are put in a lesser category because they aren\u2019t the stereotypical dominant, controlling, and overachieving men that hegemonic masculinity expects; they become victims in society due to this idea of thought.\n           One summer evening while Tita Carol was away doing some shopping, my Uncle Fred got drunk and started talking to us boys, my cousins, and me about \u201cmanly stuff\u201d. He ended up discussing women in excruciating detail by vulgarly sexualizing and even degrading them and saying things such as, \u201cYou guys need to get women with meat on her bones, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll know she\u2019ll feed you right\u201d or \u201cYou guys need to gain a woman who\u2019s a 6 or 7 because women who are 9\u2019s and 10\u2019s don\u2019t stay too long\u201d. Uncle Fred continued in a drunken stupor about how a woman\u2019s ass is more important than boobs. While listening I ended up having a disgusted look on my face which my Uncle quickly called out. I explained to him that his comments didn\u2019t feel right to me and how it asserts and perpetuates that women should be practically servants to men. He quickly responded by laughing at my face and told me that I\u2019ll learn one day that he\u2019s right, how I need to learn how to engage in locker-room talk and do more manly activities with them. My cousins sat there in silence while I listened to their father\u2019s comments.\n           Another similar event happened while staying at their house, on my 13th birthday we all decided to host a big Filipino party at my Tita\u2019s. The party was going well until my Uncle Fred started drinking. I was outside playing with my cousins and other kids till he stopped drinking to strangely comment how my testicles would grow in and I\u2019d start feeling certain ways toward women. I became so embarrassed because all the other kids and even their parents heard him talk to me that way. I soon went over to my mother and my Tita Carol tearing up and explaining what happened and they excused it by saying it was the alcohol talking and that he loves me. Both my mother and my Tita Carol are married to men who I know married them due to Asian fetishization and due to the effects of hegemonic masculinity. I truly believe both men do not think of them as equals. I soon went back outside wiping the tears off my face which my Uncle noticed and said, \u201cMan up John. Men don\u2019t cry\u201d as he was rummaging through the garage fridge for more beer. I have been surrounded by a culture of hegemonic masculinity ever since my days as a young boy, and it is being perpetuated by not only the powerful men in my family but also the women who are victims of it as well.\n           Brett Stoudt discusses in his article how these wealthy, upper-class white boys who attend a rich all-boys private school named Rockport and their experiences of violence in relation to the concept of hegemonic masculinity. For instance, the author concluded that hegemonic masculine attributes are beneficial to the privileged boys because it directly creates a culture of competition between all of the boys which motivated them to improve. However, while this form of masculinity can be beneficial, it is only beneficial to the young men who are surrounded by the environment, fit the mold, and are privileged enough to reap the benefits. Furthermore, this formation of competition rewards men who are privileged enough to be able to compete at the top, as the ideal successful man. Although, there is certainly a sense of impunity in place towards the men who fit the mold of hegemonic masculinity and their words and actions towards \u201clesser categories of people\u201d.\n           As I have stated before, my cousins have been more privileged than I have. They have had more economic advantages, social advantages, educational advantages, and other privileges than I ever will. Both of them have always worked well with the plans of my Uncle Fred and they especially check out all the categories for hegemonic masculinity. Moreover, like the Rockport boys, my cousins have benefitted due to the competitive effects of hegemonic masculine attributes they have learned from their father. My older cousin James always followed his Father\u2019s words as if they are absolute and has become a man with hegemonic masculine values and attributes. He has always stayed consistent in his beliefs imparted to him from my Uncle Fred, that men must be at the very top, must be dominant, non-emotional, tough, competitive, and overall superior to women. It is the same for my younger cousin, Fred Jr. as I watch him grow up into his freshman year of high school. Their beliefs are perpetuated because they aren\u2019t challenged by diverse mindsets and when they are exposed to those different mindsets they push them away.\n           The youth of society who are inharmonious with the culture of hegemonic masculinity can grow up believing they are \u201clesser than\u201d because they are forced into a position of a \u201clesser category\u201d by these hegemonic masculine men and those who perpetuate this form of masculinity. Now, what can the people put these lesser categories do to stop this cycle? It is through educating oneself about these harmful stereotypes and how toxic they can be to others who don\u2019t fit the mold of hegemonic masculinity, only then we can start working to create change.",
