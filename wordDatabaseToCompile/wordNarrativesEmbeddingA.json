In life, you have to play different roles to make everyone happy. By playing these roles, this is how society judges you. If you play a good role, society will like you. If not, you will be disliked by society. These roles are also looped into the collective consciousness where people with similar beliefs are put in this stereotype of their type of person. Playing a role in life causes people to get through unneeded stress and makes them feel as if they have to make up a character to be around people when we should genuinely escape this collective consciousness let people live the life they want to. \n\tPlaying a role is the basis of how society judges you. Through your roles, you define to everyone the person you are. Goffman stated, \"the very structure of the self can be seen in terms of how we arrange for such performances in our Anglo-American society.\" (Goffman 256) When he talks about the self, he is talking about the image you portray out into society. The self is something that is housed inside someone's body that allows them to play this role. Many people have this happen in their life and never realize. Our roles constantly judge us, and if you break your role, the whole thought of you will be different throughout society. \n\tIn your life, your role has two main parts the character and the performer. The charter is stated as \"a figure, typically a fine one, whose spirit, strength, and other sterling qualities the performer was designed to evoke.\" (Goffman 256) I take this statement as the character is the person you become due to what the performer wants. The performer is defined as \"a harried fabricator of impressions involved in the all-too-human task of staging a performance.\" (Goffman 256) In my mind, this is saying that we are not our true selves. We are just trying to make everyone believe that the \"performance\" is the real you and that you are different from what you are. \n\tIn my life, I have had this happen numerous times. I catch myself changing who I am to fit in. I never really knew what this was called until I learned about roles. The one significant time in my life I noticed me playing a role to make people like me, and I had to become a completely different person. This time in my life was my freshman year of high school. I had these friends from middle school who were considered popular kids. I tried so hard to change who I am to fit in with them, and it worked. I had them all fooled that I was exactly like them, a kid that pushed their parent's boundaries. I eventually had to give up the role. It became too much to handle. I could not put up with the act anymore, so I dropped it. This action caused me to lose many friends, but it was the best thing for my mental health. It allowed me to become my authentic self again. \n\tAnother time I have done this in my life was when I was younger. My parents had this idea that I needed to be the perfect child and never mess up, so I took this role to the extreme and made them believe that I was as great as they wanted me to be. This standard made my life very hard. I had to get straight A's, or I thought they would be disappointed in me. I took any time I got a bad grade on a quiz to heart and would think about it over and over again, which caused me to start doing terribly in school. This role of the perfect child also carried over into sports. My family is a huge sports family. My older sister was a star softball player, and I felt I had to live up to her shoes. I was practicing 20 to 30 a week to be able to perform this role. This role had terrible effects on my body. I hurt my arm many times and did not tell anyone because I did not want to disappoint my parents. It took me until I turned 15 to realize that my parents only wanted me to be happy, and I was not disappointing them as long as I gave 100 percent effort.\n\tThrough these experiences, this is what allowed me to realize that roles are a real thing that happens in everyone's life. If you say you had never played a role in your life, you are lying. You may not notice that this is a thing that has been happening, but you are playing a role, and society is judging you on every move you make. Society is a very judgmental crowd. You cannot do anything without it judging you. You may believe that everyone likes the role you are playing, but there will always be someone who does not like it. You have to learn that you should not try to make society happy and focus on yourself. \n\tThroughout life, you will always play a role, whether to get a job or in a relationship. We do things to make everyone happy at the expense of ourselves. This causes people to have mental illnesses. We have this pressure of people watching every move we make so that people in society will accept us, which causes us to put way too much stress on ourselves. This is where depression and anxiety come from because we walk on theoretical eggshells, trying not to mess up and get judged by society. The advice I would give from someone that has been through this is that you need to live your life and only worry about what you think of yourself. Life is a journey that only you will be around to see yourself to the end at the end of the day. You have to live with the person you are. Society will eventually forget everything you have done when something more significant happens. However, you will be there with all the things you have done on your conscience. \n\tAnother topic that I believe ties into the roles of life is the collective conscious. The collective conscious is defined as \"a set of shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.\" (Durkheim Collective Consciousness slides) I take this as society believes that everyone should be grouped by the way they think, such as people with similar political views or religious beliefs. This and the roles are very similar because your collective consciousness is based on the role you play. \n\tThe collective consciousness allows you to find what you believe in and be grouped with people who have a similar outlook on the same things. This could be through institutions such as schools where everyone is there for the same fundamental reason to better their lives by getting a degree. This is something that you have to accept. You are always going to be in a group that has the same ideals as you. \n\tIn my life, this is always there. In high school, I hung out with athletes because I was an athlete and had similar views on life. This also links into the roles because I was playing a role in my school as an athlete; thus, I was grouped into this collective consciousness that I was meant to hang out with people like me. This is where I believe society is messed up. Society has this way of making everyone believe that you have to be exactly what society wants, which is not valid. You can have your views on things and still get along with people. We need to be individuals, not a group that society thinks they can push around. \n\tAnother example that I have noticed in my life is school. Here at college, I have noticed that everyone has this same ideal about college, and this ideal is that you will not have a successful life if you do not attend college. Going to college has become a stereotype that you have to go or are a less than worthy person in society. This has caused all of us to have this collective consciousness that we have to go to college to get a good job and live a happy life which is not valid. We need to start pushing away from this and not let society have such a stronghold in our lives.\n\tThe collective consciousness is everywhere in society. I believe that this is outdated, and we need to push away from it. This pushes unneeded stress on the younger generations of society. You are already falling into it from a young age where we are placed around people with similar beliefs to use. Life nowadays is much different than it used to be. If we started pushing out of this way of thinking, we would move much further as a society. We need to learn to listen to each other and learn new things from different beliefs. This will allow us to see things from many different points of view, and this with ultimately allow us to leave things behind and have a more innovative and more well-rounded society. \n\tThe collective consciousness has a hold on society. It has been engraved into our minds that this is how the world should be. You stay around people that are similar to you. This thinking causes people to be stereotyped into groups. In school, just because you played sports, you got put into this group of jocks that people disliked because they are known as the people who think they are better than everyone else. The collective consciousness lets people group you without actually knowing who you are, which causes the group to live up to the stereotype.\n\tWith all this information, you can see how you are always playing a role in society no matter who you are. Society has caused people to believe that they are not a meaningful part of society if they are not playing a good role. This role has worn me down mentally, and I believe that we need to push away from people playing roles. They should be who they are, not whom society wants them to be. The collective consciousness also plays a role in this people have been told for so long that you have to be around people like you are you will not get along. This made-up stereotype makes people feel that they will be judged if they push out of the group they belong to. In all, I believe that we need to push away from our older ways and accept everyone for who they are. Life is too short to allow society to make us scared and play a role so that people will like us and want to be around you.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t",

        "text": "2360\nThe Social Media Self\nTo see ourselves as an object, and present ourselves as one, comes from in person communication. Mead states that \u201c... he becomes an object to himself only by taking the attitudes of other individuals towards himself within a social environment\u2026\u201d. Presenting oneself on social media is very different from how we present ourselves in person. The social environment mead talks about is very different on a phone. In the real world environment, the attitudes of people are shown within body language and tone. We then pickup these social cues in order to formulate how we present ourselves back. On social media you don't see that body language or tone. It is much easier to put on a fake persona and present yourself in a way that you want to be likable, without those in person judgments. That nervous or heart racing feeling when talking to someone new for the first time is what comes from that fear of judgment. Social media is a way around that nervous feeling because you are not face-to-face with others and have more control over your own presentation. \nSocial media has a large effect on how we develop our own classifications to social groups. In \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation'' by Emile Durkheim, Durkeim explains that collective consciousness is a shared understanding within social groups that helps people form a sense of belonging and purpose. Through social media many people have the ability to brand themselves and decide their own aesthetic. This communicates with other people the social groups they belong to. For example, on many social media platforms you can repost things on your profile. People who classify themselves as religious may repost religious content that displays what kind of group they identify with. Having support from people that they relate to allows them to feel that sense of belonging and meaning. Trying to find what you like and want to be a part of is much more intimidating in real life. You have to have that face-to-face communication with people that are similar to you or that you want to be similar to. A new interest can cause people to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable which can shy people away from reaching out and trying to join social groups they feel like they might identify with. On social media you don't have to worry or feel uncomfortable because you are behind the phone. \nThe self can be broken down into the \u201cme\u201d, and the \u201cI\u201d. In relation to social media, the process in deciding what to post on a user's page is what constitutes the\u201d I\u201d, while the actual post itself, is the \u201cMe\u201d. Mead states, \u201cThe unity and structure of the complete self reflects the unity and structure of the social process as a whole\u201d. The social process of talking in your head trying to formulate what you want to say and what you are actually saying is what makes up the self. People present themselves in the way they want other people to perceive them. For example, when a college student is getting ready for a party with their friends they think about what hair, makeup, clothes, and even smell they want to have in order to appeal to others. That thought process is what constitutes their \u201cI\u201d while their product of those decisions is their \u201cme\u201d. Mead also talks about how there are different selves that we choose to portray to different groups and when \u201can event leads to emotional upheavals''(Mead) people can dissociate and show different selves. On social media you present only one \u201cme\u201d while in society you can present multiple versions of \u201cme\u201d. You can escape social media by turning your phone off, but you cannot escape a current situation or person-to-person interaction. On social media the construction of the \u201cme\u201d is much more controlled than in person. \nBoth Mead and Durkheim show that social interaction along with social groups are what allow individuals to formulate their own identity and persona. The development of the \u201cme\u201d, or your identity that you put on display, is created in an effort to feel accepted amongst society. Social media has caused people to be less social because it is an easier and safer option of presenting yourself, finding similar social groups, and finding that sense of purpose and belonging. The generation of the \u201cme\u201d is easier on social media because you have a safe environment that you control allowing the only \u201cme\u201d you want to be presented.\n",

        "text": "Second Reflection Essay\n\n\nThe idea of collective consciousness is that society creates a thing that everyone thinks and that no one messes with that idea. This is what causes us to join in groups of people that think the same way as us and we normally stick to this group. This group we are put in is what created the idea of the collective consciousness. This can be the way we view political matters such as wars and economics. \n\nHarari speaks on the reasons why we don\u2019t fight real wars anymore. War used to be a good thing for the United States. The Mexican-American war is a perfect example of this where we gained land from fighting a war. Another example is World War II this war was a big reason the United States got out of the great depression. We changed almost every factory in the country to a military factor and this caused the economy to skyrocket. Everyone was working and making money. Now we don\u2019t gain anything out of fighting wars; it would honestly be harmful to our economy. We don\u2019t need land and we would just be losing life for the land we don\u2019t need. The latest wars we are in are technology-based where we are trying to find new knowledge and push ahead of every other country on the technology front. \nThe idea of the collective consciousness is related to the reason we don\u2019t fight wars anymore. We have this idea throughout society that wars are now useless and that we have no reason to fight them anymore. This idea is one that when we hear it we don\u2019t argue with it because we are told that wars are not beneficial for anyone. Wars do nothing for us now besides cost every country involved in the loss of life. \n\nAnother concept that agrees with the collective consciousness is why we fear terrorism. Terrorism is something that we have been taught to fear since we were young. Why do we fear this when sugar kills more people every year. This is because of the collective consciousness that we have in this nation that terrorists are scarier. We need to stop believing everything we see and make our own decisions on the information we are given. It is hard to believe that we are more scared of something that kills a low amount of people but are not scared of something that kills thousands of people a year and we still consume it like it is healthy for us. \n\nAnother idea that is with the same ideas of the collective consciousness is our sense of justice. We have the roots to our justice from the revolutionary era. Our ideas are outdated but they still use them. We have this idea that this is just the way the justice system should work so no one questions it. We need to push away from this thinking that everything in the justice system is perfect because it can always be improved but it seems as if we are content with keeping things the same and not improving them. \n\nAn idea that agrees with Harari is \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation\u201d by Durkheim. He says that science has religious roots which allow us to be able to push technology into the future. He also says that great social institutions are born of religion. This means that where we have founded all the great ideas has been in a place founded on the basis of religion. Religion has had a way of making it so that we can take what we have heard in religion and use those ideas to create new technologies which are the basis of what we strive for today to create new ways to answer questions we didn\u2019t originally know the answer to. \n\nHarari\u2019s ideas on religion are very similar. He thinks that religion was the foundation of the science boom that we saw due to the fact that people found out that they can not pray for something to be created but actually have to gain the knowledge and do it themselves. This also caused us to use science to figure out the real reason behind everyday things we see such as rain. For a long time, people prayed for rain because they thought it was a god that controls the rain. When praying did not work this caused them to try to find a way to explain why this happens.\n\n  These two ideas go hand and hand. You can see that both of them had similar reasoning on why they thought religion was important to us. This reason is that it gave us the reason to start studying the real process of things that happen instead of just believing god causes everything. This gave us the opportunity to become the plant we are today with all the technological advances we see in everyday life. We pushed out of the bubble thinking that god is the reason everything happens.\n\nOne thing that does not agree with Harari is discrimination in the low-wage labor market. The idea of discrimination in the low-wage labor market is that people are not getting jobs because of the color of their skin. They also channel people into different jobs based on their skin color. It also says that people of color have to work twice as hard to find a place to work compared to white people. They are even more likely to hire a white person with criminal charges over a person of color. \n\nHarari states in his book that most jobs will be taken over by robots. This will cause people to lose jobs at a fast rate. We already see this in grocery stores where self-checkout is taking jobs from people and making it so they do not have to pay cashiers. We also see this in factories where machines are making all of the parts and assembling the product and boxing it by itself, taking jobs away from people. \n\nThis is how they disagree due to the fact that the low-wage jobs are soon going to not be around. This is going to make it where there won\u2019t be discrimination because they will not have any people working these jobs anymore. This is also a bad thing because now people will be out of work and will not be able to make money which will eventually cause the economy to fail because we will not have people spending money which will make it so no money is circling through the economy. This could also be a good thing that will cause people to become more skilled in a certain trade which will make our country a more educated place due to the fact that you will have to get educated to get a job. This will cause everyone to be a better overall employee and make more money for themselves and their family. \n\nThroughout this course, we have covered many different things but I believe that \u201cThe Neurology of Religion\u201d by Maryanski and Turner disagrees with Harari\u2019s view on religion. The way Maryanski and Turner talk about religion is that it is not the one we see today but a way for our ancestors to communicate and create communities. They also think that religion is still an important part of our society and that it creates groups that allow people to have reasons for what is unexplainable by science. \n\nHarari talks about religion in a different way; he talks about how religion is on the way out and that we do not need it like we used to. He said religion was used to be thought of as a way to bring the rain of creating things we need such as bombs. But now we know that praying cannot give you these things and that you just have to wait for nature to bring rain or make a bomb on your own. He also believes that we use religion on the basis of science and that it allows us to create new technologies that explain why things that originally were thought to be something god made actually happen.\n\nAs we can see Harari and Maryanski have different ideas on how we use religion. Harari sees it as an outdated system of grouping people together to find reasons for why things happen and that if they pray it will allow them to have rain and gain the knowledge to make new inventions. While Maryanski believes that it was an important part of the evolution of humans due to the fact that it allowed us to communicate and make up for reasons why things were happening and it gave us the ability to make up stories that we are able to pass down to younger generations like the folk tales we still have today. \n\nAs we can see with all this information many people within the field of sociology have different views on many different things. Harari has views similar to most of Durkheim's ideas such as the way war and terrorism tie into the way we view things due to the collective consciousness and the way religion has led to the advance in science. There are also ideas that Harari had that didn\u2019t have the same views such as discrimination in the low-wage labor market and the way \u201cThe Neurology of Religion\u201d by Maryanski and Turner disagrees with Harari\u2019s view on religion. \n\n\n\n    \n",

        "text": "Synthesis Paper 1\n1901\n2/8/24\nUnveiling the Darker Side of Social Media: Pitfalls and Perils\n\tSocial media exerts various impacts on individuals, both positive and negative. This paper aims to show two primary adverse effects of social media on individuals. One significant aspect affected by social media is the individual's sense of self, including their perception of identity and personality. James' concept of the \"social self\" states that one's self-image is constructed from external viewpoints and their role within a particular context. This notion depicts how social media contributes to shaping individuals' self-perception. Moreover, from a collective perspective, Fligstein and MacAdams contend that individuals have an inherent need to belong to a group, which can alleviate cognitive load\u2014the amount of information processed. While alleviating cognitive burden appears beneficial initially, it can inadvertently lead to adverse consequences in individuals' lives, such as the spreading of misinformation. Additionally, when individuals are part of a group, they may not adequately consider the consequences of their actions. This lack of critical thinking, coupled with the potential for misinformation, can create a continuous cycle of misinformation and negative outcomes.\n\tHow does social media play a part in one\u2019s identity of self? Self-identity is the dynamic and subjective perception individuals have of themselves, shaped by personal experiences, social interactions, and cultural influences, and it plays a pivotal role in guiding their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and interactions with others. Social media allows us to swiftly share our lives on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, presenting highlights and candid moments to a wide audience. However, this can foster a culture of fabrication, where idealized versions of reality lead to feelings of inadequacy and a need for comparison. Moreover, the limited view smartphones offer fails to capture life's complexity, showing the gap between online personas and real experiences. For instance, encountering a seemingly genuine weight-loss journey on TikTok might inspire hope and effort. However, discovering it's built on falsehoods can fuel self-doubt and negativity, particularly when compared to naturally slender individuals. This deception triggers a detrimental comparison, tarnishing one's self-image.\n\tThe impulse to form groups dates back to our ancestors, offering a cognitive load reduction. Collective meaning-making establishes a sense of belonging, facilitates shared understanding and interpretation of events or experiences, promotes collaboration and cooperation among group members, and can lead to the development of shared goals, values, and identities.  However, social media can adversely affect this dynamic. Consider scrolling through Instagram and encountering a post where someone speaks negatively about another content creator. Without full context, you and others join in the collective condemnation, resulting in unwarranted hate towards the individual. This collective action, fueled by miscommunication, can have severe consequences, such as the content creator being banned and losing their earnings. It underscores the importance of seeking understanding before engaging in collective actions. Social media amplifying collective-mean-making can result in negative actions, highlighting the importance of approaching online interactions with critical thinking and awareness of the potential consequences before reacting to everything on social media.\n\tIn both scenarios, social media's impact on individuals' sense of self and cognitive processing is evident. The first scenario illustrates how encountering a seemingly genuine weight-loss journey on TikTok can inspire hope and effort, only to lead to feelings of self-doubt and negativity upon discovering the fabrication behind it. Similarly, in the second scenario, collective condemnation on platforms like Instagram demonstrates how social media can amplify negative actions, such as hate towards content creators, due to a lack of critical thinking and miscommunication. These examples underscore the detrimental effects of social media on individuals' identities and behaviors, expressing the importance of approaching online interactions with awareness and critical thinking to mitigate such consequences. Social media, as a platform that capitalizes on the idea of identity and collective thinking, has the potential to significantly influence how individuals perceive themselves and engage with others in the digital realm.\nSocial media wields a diverse impact on individuals, encompassing both positive and negative ramifications. This paper explains two impacts social media have: the distortion of self-perception and the amplification of collective-mean-making. Social media plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals' sense of self, drawing from James' concept of the \"social self\" and Fligstein and MacAdams' assertion on the need for group belonging. However, the platform's prevalence of fabrication and misinformation raises feelings of inadequacy and comparisons, undermining genuine self-awareness and identity formation. In both scenarios presented, social media's influence on individuals' cognitive processing and self-perception is palpable. The fabricated narratives and collective condemnation highlight the platform's potential to cause negative actions and miscommunication. Nonetheless, social media possesses inherent potential for positive transformation. When wielded judiciously, it serves as a conduit for sharing authentic experiences and fostering meaningful connections. By prioritizing critical thinking and mindfulness, individuals can harness social media's power to promote empathy, diversity, and positive societal change. Emphasizing transparency, authenticity, and responsible engagement can control the negative effects of social media, allowing it to fulfill its potential as a force for good in shaping identities and enriching human experiences in the digital age.\n",

        "text": "850649039\nSOC 105\n2/8/24\nCooley & Goffman theories of self\n\nWhen examining ourselves, society and how we fit into society there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. We are different in every social situation, every social interaction within that situation and when we are alone as well. Some sociologists like Erving Goffman and his \u201cPresentation of Self\u201d theory argue we are always on display and \u201cperforming for others\u201d and through that lens is how we view ourselves even when we are alone. Others such as James Cooley and his \u2018Looking-Glass Self\u201d theory, argue that our own perception of self is solely based on others perceptions of us in social situations. Goffman and Cooley\u2019s theories argue that others' perception is key when creating the self, as well as having different ideas about how the self is created and used.\nCooley\u2019s \u201cLooking-Glass Self\u201d theory discusses the idea that there are three parts to how we see ourselves that all culminate in our bigger picture of our own identity and perceptions of ourselves. He argues it is made up of our perception of ourselves, how others see us and how we perceive how others feel about us. Our perception of self is mainly built on how we perceive others thoughts and feelings about us. One very simple example would be if you trip going up the stairs alone, you would tend to feel less embarrassed than if there were a bunch of people behind us and a natural reaction would be to look around to see if anyone saw you. You would be more embarrassed if there were people because you would worry that they thought it was funny or thought of you as \u201cless than\u201d because you tripped going up the stairs. So the perception of others perception of you affects how you see and think about yourself and specifically your actions greatly.\nGoffman\u2019s \u201cPresentation of Self\u201d theory argues that we are always putting on a performance of sorts and that we develop our own selves as a product of performing. Without the stage (social situations) that we are put in we would not develop our own selves and if we execute it well enough it can appear to others as though the traits we display are innate within ourselves and genuine. He also explains that our actual self, because it is purely defined and shown when on stage, doesn\u2019t really exist outside the stage. He also separates the \u201cperformer\u201d from the \u201ccharacter\u201d, where the character is what/who we perform that is kind of mixed in with the self and the performer is the character and self fully mixed together and is seen as the entire person. He showcases our different performances based on front stage versus backstage. Front stage is seen as the place where we most try to make an impression on people and perform the most because we know they are watching. One example of this is if you are at a family gathering full of extended family members you do not really know. You might perform as a polite, quiet, reserved person so as to not leave a bad impression or change the notion of your character they had in your head. Backstage would be a small intimate family gathering full of only your closest family members you see often. You might be boisterous, funny and outgoing as it is a more relaxed and informal setting and you can take character risks too. Essentially we are individuals who perform as well as characters that are being performed.\nBoth theories discuss the idea that the \u201cself\u201d solely exists in social situations. The idea that we are \u201cperformers\u201d on stage is similar to the idea that others' perception of us is what makes our own selves. Cooley and Goffman both explain that the \u201cself\u201d is developed through social situations and still exists when we are alone, just in a much different capacity. However, some main differences are that Goffman argues we have tendencies to \u201cperform\u201d in ways that show us as good and moral people to others, while Cooley doesn\u2019t argue we act in a certain way to have others perceive us in that certain way, only that we see our true selves through the eyes of other people. Goffman also argues that if others find out we are performing for them, their perception of our morality and goodness is gone and the \u201cact\u201d is essentially over. This is different from Cooley who argues that we all know we perceive ourselves based on how others perceive us and that it is acceptable and natural. In addition, Cooley suggests that we are different in solitude but the core of our self still stays the same while Goffman suggests that we are completely different in solitude as our self is purely defined and shown in social situations.\n",

        "text": "2360\nSOC-105-001\n05 May 2024\nRousseau's influence in class\n\tRousseau's ideas of the formation of private property are what have influenced the class difference and inequality we see today. Rousseau thought that agriculture and claiming land as your own is what marked the start of peoples unequal lifestyles. It is what has led us to social divisions in wealth, power, and status. A person's economical standing and class affects where they live. Different areas offer different opportunities like education, jobs, good housing options, and altogether lifestyles. This is shown in Mantosios comparisons of people's lifestyles in different class rankings of economic stances. \n\tRousseau argued that humans started out as good, living in a society with equality and freedom for all. What changed this and corrupted this system was the emergence of private property. With people now having the power to own their own land and its resources, they became more and more divided. The more land you could have to farm or the more fertile the land the more money you made. The more money you made based on those qualities allowed for people to hire workers or those without land to come work on their own. This created a distinction between land owners and their workers. Dividing society into class systems. Those divisions have now progressed into the class system we see today that have shaped people's different lifestyles. \n\tThis can be shown even more in the ideas of Gregory Mantosios. Mantosios explains and addresses the different lifestyles of people with different economic statuses. He states that differences in class shape the entire lifestyles people live. The economic position someone has determines the area they live in which then determines their education, their access to quality food, and the kind of jobs available to them. Class rank can cause variation even as simple as \u201cplaying a game of handball in the park and taking riding lessons at a private stable; watching a movie on television and going to the theater; taking the subway to work and being driven in a limousine\u201d (Mantosios). Even the little experiences people have in life are shaped by the class a person is ranked in which was sparked with the early creation of private property. \n\tRousseau's idea of private property also leading to class divide through estrangement is important. Now that individuals could own property that they could make money off of, there was a social divide. But what enhanced and fueled that social divide was the emotions people felt from their now created positions. The people who owned land took advantage of people who needed money making them feel helpless and isolated. This intensified over time to the divide between society leading to many of the gaps and inequalities we see in class rank today. \n\tMantosis brings up three different American lifestyles who live in New york. He introduces the first being Harold, the second being Bob, and the third being Cheryl. Harold and Cheryl have the biggest contrast in lifestyles. Harold has two homes that are in very expensive parts of New york. It is stated that the interior of his first residence is \u201cprofessionally decorated and accented with elegant furnishings, valuable antiques, and expensive artwork\u201d (Mantosis). Harold didn't get a job till he was 23 and attended private schools with tutoring available whenever. In contrast Cheryl lives in a three room apartment in South Bronx, New York. Her first job was at the age 17 and got as far as community college but was said to have dropped out for financial complications. These two people are clearly in different economic standings which affects where they live, their education and what they do on a day to day basis. \n\tOver time these lifestyle differences became normalized. Rousseau believed that because there was a small percentage of people who contained the wealth and power due to property separation, they had a large influence and control over cultural and equality ideologies. They set new standards and normalized the idea that obtaining material things like land, workers, and money is what the world is supposed to be. The policies then put in place are in favor of those elites with the most money. This ongoing development is what has led to the lifestyle difference seen between Harold and Cherly.\n\tThe class system and American lifestyle is influenced by the early ideas of Rousseau. His ideas of the emergence of private property, the feeling of estrangement amongst non-owners, and the normalization of it all is what has shaped the classes and division of our present american society. The ideas of Rousseau are demonstrated in the writings of Mantosios when he talks about all the effects of class on lifestyle and the imbalance of it all. The effect of class and socioeconomic status has an effect on people's lifestyle including housing, food, mental state, jobs, education and even resources or opportunities available. Those with a higher class have more privilege than those with a lower class. The idea established by Rousseau has influenced this kind of inequality and severance laced throughout our society. \n\n\t\n",

Harari incorporates many of the ways humanity involves itself with these issues as he connects many ideologies and theories of sociology within his work, as well as challenging and critiquing others. \nAccording to \u00c9mile Durkheim\u2019s theory of the collective consciousness,  a society is not merely a mass of individuals or the grounds or objects they occupy and possess, but rather an idea which it forms of itself collectively with the ideals each individual contains. Durkheim offered that by collectively believing in these practices and beliefs a united and bonded community would be created. The collective consciousness binds individuals together and creates social integration. Through social interactions, this ideology of the collective consciousness is formed. \u201cDurkheim believed that society exerted a powerful force on individuals. According to Durkheim, people\u2019s norms, beliefs, and values make up a collective consciousness, or a shared way of understanding and behaving in the world\u201d (Libretexts). Within his theory, Durkheim argues the difference between what he referred to as organic versus mechanical solidarity. He stated that societies containing a traditional, mechanical mindedness, individuals are much more independent and self-reliant resulting in little to no cooperation and interrelations within a community. However, with an organic solidarity individuals are more interdependent as social cohesion arises is social cohesion from the dependence individuals have on each other from the complementaries within a society. While a collective consciousness within a society may be certain laws, traditions, or values; it can also be shared beliefs and stereotypes that are created and then exercised collectively. \nWithin his book, Harari sheds light on the steps not just as individual nations, but steps we will have to take globally in order to make progress with some of the issues and concerns he shares. Harari offers pieces of advice related to this concept in a chapter titled, \u201cNationalism: Global problems need global answers\u201d. Harari critiques that as a society, we easily develop and create loyalties to small groups. He further adds that \u201cit is hardly natural for humans to be loyal to millions of utter strangers. Such mass...require immense efforts of social construction\u201d (Harari, 175). Harari points out the dangers of these exclusive groups stating that it becomes difficult to form these bonded loyalties among mass groups of individuals because of the large role that patriotism plays in these singular nations preventing acts of global collaboration. Using the issue of climate change as an example, Harari points out that even though individual countries may adopt a variety of different government policies, essentially they will be useless unless nations all around the world follow suit. Harari emphasizes that no nation is powerful enough to stop global warming by itself; that for the various efforts that are being made to be effective, they have to be done on a global level (Harari, 187). Harari states that change may be necessary to make impacts on a global level; that individuals should simultaneously be loyal to humankind as well as nations outside our own. He argues that if the world were to follow some similar goals and values created by a collective consciousness, we would then be more productive.\nHarari\u2019s desire for global improvement relates to Durkheim\u2019s theory of collective consciousness. Right now as a planet, we are operating as a mechanical solidarity- many nations act as individuals with little to no cooperation in regards to global issues. In order to accomplish Harari\u2019s goal for the future, a shift towards organic solidarity would need to be made globally, getting rid of hostility between nations to create a united effort. With this cooperation, the strengths of all countries would most likely create more progress towards global issues rather than solely an individual effort. By adding Durkheim\u2019s theory of the collective consciousness to society as a world we could then create a set of values that operate globally rather than just within a community. The previously limited identities would be united to effectively face global problems \u2013 not just a tribe, an ethnicity, or a nation.\nWhile Harari does hint at wanting a \u201cglobal unity\u201d, he simultaneously offers a warning as to what he calls \u201cgroup think\u201d. Within this argument, he offers the possible dangers of this collective thinking. Harari argues that individuals actually know little to nothing about the world as we tend to think in groups rather than individually. Harari warns that this social integration of sharing beliefs and unique skill sets to benefit all creates a reliance \u201con the expertise of others for almost all our needs\u201d (Harari, 329). Within this idea of group think, Harari points out that those who have the power to create a collective belief are able to manipulate and impact those around them. He warns that \u201cgreat power inevitably distorts the truth\u201d...thus acting \u201clike a black hole that warps the very space around it\u201d (Harari, 334). While Harari does highlight the possible dangers of the totality of common beliefs, he shares that \u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, trusting in the knowledge of others has worked extremely well for Homo sapiens\u201d (Harari, 330). Harari\u2019s thoughts about humanity relate to Durkheim\u2019s theory of the collective consciousness because we as a society oftentimes put our trust into others to create what is considered right or wrong, or what is valued among a population. While Harari warns individuals about placing all their trust into these collective beliefs, he simultaneously suggests that they are necessary to create expectations and policies in order to make progress with societal issues. \nAs humans, we often wonder what our purpose in the world is; why do we exist? Together, Doug McAdam and Neil Fligstein offer an explanation to why we find ourselves on this Earth. \u201cThe existence theory starts from the assumption that people organize their lives around a limited set of existential milestones. Cultural expectations are such that without the accomplishment of those milestones, individuals may experience their lives as incomplete\u201d (Baert, Patrick). These milestones create purpose that make our actions, decisions, and interactions significant. The social provides coordinated, meaningful activity- it serves to make our lives purposeful and meaningful. Collectively, we make each other's lives meaningful. The functionality of the social is determined upon the ability to explore self-interest within a society. Day to day activities that create interactions such as school, work, etc., develop involvement and a broader sense of meaning to the lives of individuals. This concept of existentialism relates to Max Weber\u2019s ideology of protestantism and capitalism. Weber makes an observation about humanity consisting that the purpose of life- what brings happiness- is the making of money; that individuals are dominated by this concept of success. He adds that there is an \u201cobligation an individual is supposed to feel towards his professional activity no matter what it consists of\u201d (Weber). Weber defines the protestant ethic as the combination of dedication to disciplined work and acquisition, along with a life of denial of pleasure and spontaneity in enjoyment of life.  The belief that hard work is a good instinct and leads to the desire to work even more. Hard work is necessary in order to become successful and there are negative consequences if individuals do not work hard. Simultaneously, Weber, Flegisten, and Mcadams make an argument offering that the purpose in life is to be successful; that happiness comes from achievement. \nOn the other hand, Harari argues that happiness should come elsewhere. Harari predicts that if Artificial Intelligence took over many of the jobs in society, humans would be happier as they would have more free time. These AIs can help us move away from the mundane tasks people don\u2019t want to do and allow us to spend more time improving society. Harari believes that by doing this labor would feel like less of a task, and individuals would find more joy in working. Harari states that \u201cHuman happiness depends less on objective conditions and more on our own expectations\u201d (Harari, 78). Because our expectations and satisfaction levels adapt to changing conditions, \u201cWhen things improve, expectations balloon and consequently even dramatic improvements in conditions might leave us as dissatisfied as before\u201d (Harari, 78). Harari argues that the happiness of humanity shouldn\u2019t come from work and that \u201closing our jobs to the algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing\u201d (Harari, 80). The found pressure that revolves around being successful, as Harari points out, is actually causing more harm than good. \nThe argument that Harari makes is seen to contradict the statements Fleigsten, Mcadams, and Weber make about the purpose of individuals and happiness. Whereas others claim that happiness comes from fulfilling certain accomplishments and specific purposes, Harari disagrees believing that humanity will be improved if AIs were to take over the workforce. Harari seemingly critiques the fact that many find that \u201cmoney buys happiness\u201d.  While Weber observes that happiness comes from any form of labor- as long as success and money follow, Harari believes it originated from activities that bring satisfaction such as a job that individuals enjoy, free time, as well as time spent with family and friends. The required meaningful activities that have been said to be necessary to establish a purpose in life are contradicted by Harari as he claims that social content comes from fewer responsibilities and social pressures. \nThroughout his book, Harari offers many pieces of advice that in his opinion would help better society. While these opinions may contradict and stray from the beliefs of some significant figures of sociology, others appear to coincide, raising the question as to if these futuristic suggestions really benefit society.\nWorks Cited \n  Baert, Patrick, et al. \u201cExistence Theory: Outline for a Theory of Social Behaviour.\u201d Journal of Classical Sociology, Mar. 2021, doi:10.1177/1468795X21998247.\nHarari, Yuval Noah. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

        "text": "Sociology 105\n18 October 2021\nReflection Essay\nIssues relating to self-esteem have been proven to be a growing trend in our society today. Especially with social media that displays a magnitude of public figures- both male and female- that showcase their bodies that are seemingly out of reach for many. The struggle of body image has been reported to correlate to many more serious issues linking this low self-esteem to an increase in eating disorders and depression. Many wonder what causes these low levels of self-esteem. Why do women specifically feel more pressure from society to uphold a certain appearance? When looking at the levels of low self-esteem, oftentimes women were seen to have higher levels compared to males who were seen to have more self-esteem. Despite the growing body positivity movement seen by the diverse representation of social media influencers who challenge the stereotypical body image, worldwide many individuals- women specifically- are still struggling with their confidence and self-esteem. This is because a woman\u2019s feeling of self-worth comes from male acceptance. \n\t\tSelf-esteem has plummeted in today\u2019s society causing many to ask the question- what has caused this major drop?  In a research study made by the company, Dove, it was found that in 2016 \u201cRegardless of age or location 50% of the women surveyed had low self-esteem\u201d (Dove). When speaking on behalf of my life and the generation I am a part of, I have confidence that if women today were surveyed, the percentage would be much higher. I am someone who has struggled with self-esteem, and when talking to my peers I have noticed that I am not alone with my feelings.\n This feeling of low self-worth has only amplified after coming to college because you're constantly comparing yourself to those you are surrounded by. I know that I am not alone when I admit that I have made some unhealthy choices when it comes to low self-esteem. When it comes to shaping themselves to society\u2019s standards, \u201c9 out of 10 women will stop themselves from eating or will otherwise put their health at risk\u201d (Dove). Starvation and over-exercising are some of the few red flags when it comes to not only a possible eating disorder, but extremely low levels of self-esteem as well. I can admit that when I go to the gym, I am not going to be healthy or get stronger; I am going in an attempt to transform my body into one that fits what society calls \u201cdesirable\u201d. Who determines what qualities are considered desirable in today\u2019s society? Some argue that it is social media that portrays these valued qualities. Similar to myself, 69% of women agreed that advertising and media create negative feelings as well as contributing to appearance anxiety as a result of increased social pressures (Dove). Seeing beautiful models all over Instagram or in advertisements often gives many women the feeling of \u201cI wish I looked like that\u201d. \nOn the other hand, men are seen to play a role in creating many of the displayed stereotypes of women\u2019s appearance. While in today\u2019s society women have newfound independence, I have noticed that mainly adolescents depend on \u201cmale validation\u201d to make themselves feel confident. Females subconsciously seek this validation from men in order to make themselves feel valuable. \u201cA recent study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science found that telling women men were attracted to non-stick-thin models increased their body satisfaction\u201d (Atlantic). We seek these positive comments and compliments from others that we are not able to give to ourselves. However, by doing this we are unknowingly giving men the power to create the standards for what is \u201cdeserving\u201d of these positive remarks. \nI have begun to think that being self-conscious, and being uncomfortable in your skin has seen to become normal. Because this lack of comfort is now thought of as \u201cnormal\u201d, many are letting this growing issue slip through the cracks. Insecurities that many women face such as weight, blemishes, stretch marks are put in place because society has told us that we are less desirable and ugly if we have them, or if we fail to look a certain way. \nThis low self-esteem found in women can be explained using Naomi Wolf\u2019s theory of the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d. According to Wolf, the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d she describes includes physical or behavioral qualities a woman must embody to feel desired. Although these specific qualities are not universal as different cultures value other qualities, all around the world women are held to standards they must meet to be valued in society. According to Wolf, the beauty myth is an order that dictates behavior rather than appearance while basing the identity and value of women on their beauty. This social fiction emerged after the second wave of feminism in the 1960s after women began to gain political and social equality. The beauty myth was used as a political weapon to make women feel as though beauty was necessary for success in life. Later, as women gained reproductive rights, it gave them control over their own bodies seeing as men previously had treated them like objects. However, with the development of the beauty myth, \u201ceating disorders rose and a mass neurosis was promoted that used weight and food to strip women of the sense of control\u201d (Wolf) they had previously held. After women began to gain status, men felt as though they had to regain their social dominance. This need for a dominant role in society refers to the hegemonic masculinity that justifies the subordinate role of women in society. Historically, this oppression of women was considered normal and was accepted- because women began to become stronger materially, male-dominated institutions thought that the best way to weaken them was by setting beauty standards. \n Wolf\u2019s concept of the beauty myth is seen to be linked to Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s \u201cWomen as the Other\u201d. Here, men are classified as the object whereas women are seen as the object. Men make themselves the absolute where women voluntarily submit, making themselves the \u201cother\u201d. De Beauvoir addresses that women disclose themselves as being inessential, handing men the power. Some men address women as \u201can incomplete man, an accidental being\u201d or that they have a \u201clack of qualities\u201d. Both women address that the subordination of women is directly caused by males and the power they hold in society. These women challenge the oppression of women, aiming to seek control in a society that collectively subordinates and objectifies them. Where women previously served as solely a reproductive purpose, both Wolf and De Beauvoir- as well as other feminists- are seen fighting the collective consciousness that supplies gender roles amongst a society. \nWhile we are in a generation where women are treated equally and face less discrimination than compared to past generations, there are still remnants of the past that trickle into the ways of society today. Males no longer possess absolute dominance in society; however, it becomes clear that they still have an influence on some aspects of a woman\u2019s life. Women often determine their self-worth based on what a man is attracted to. By giving males power over these standards, they are given control over the collective consciousness of a society; this then gives men the ability to determine what is considered beautiful, and what is considered worthy and valuable. \nHaving social media at our fingertips in today\u2019s generation seemingly has negative effects when it comes to the self-esteem of women. Because the internet is flooded with images of beautiful women that fit the stereotype of a \u201cperfect body\u201d it creates a negative body image because subconsciously women think that they need to fit this stereotype to be wanted. Even though the \u201cbeauty myth\u201d played a role in our past, it is still seen to cause similar issues in the present. Although no longer used as a political weapon, many women still hold the belief that their identity and worth are defined by their beauty and appearance, causing them to be vulnerable to the outside approval of a male. The previous dominant role men held in society created negative lasting impacts that are still seen to hold even in the 21st century. Although some hate to admit it because it contradicts the image of a strong, independent woman; many, however, crave male validation. Male validation is significantly problematic for women because we live in a patriarchal society, where more time and value are given to men\u2019s opinions. Women\u2019s self-esteem becomes dependent on male appreciation similar to how Wolf notes that because of the standards men set in society, women feel obligated to fulfill them in fear that they will not have any value or meaning. \nThe effort of the body positivity movement fails to achieve its goal of raising women\u2019s self-esteem because it lacks the involvement of men. Even with the countless women participating in the appreciation of all bodies, it fails to destroy the fact that men still hold preference to certain body types over others. Women have these negative body images because they have certain expectations of what they perceive men will deem as desirable; then trying to mold themselves to fit that image to be wanted- similar to Wolf\u2019s perception of how women believed they needed to contain beauty to be successful. \nWomen often seek reassurance from men that they let determine their worth. Because the male figure has held the title of the dominant figure in society throughout history, certain ideas from the past have not yet been revolutionized; remaining the same even centuries later. Men strip women of their confidence by creating these unrealistic \u201cideal body images\u201d only to be the same ones who provide them with the feeling of being wanted. \n\n\nWorks Cited\nBeck, Julie. \u201cWomen's Self-Esteem and What Men Want.\u201d The Atlantic, Atlantic Media Company, 14 Jan. 2015, www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/the-connection-between-womens-self-esteem-and-what-men-want/384492/. \nDove. \u201cNew Dove Research Finds Beauty Pressures up, and Women and Girls Calling for Change.\u201d New Dove Research Finds Beauty Pressures Up, and Women and Girls Calling for Change, 29 June 2018, www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dove-research-finds-beauty-pressures-up-and-women-and-girls-calling-for-change-583743391.html. \n\n\n",

        "text": "1901\n5/2/24\nLooking-glass self through the lens of class status\n\tClass status has a huge role in society and how people view themselves. Class is engrained in everything that makes up the world, from our opportunities to how people interact with others. Social interactions help shape how we view ourselves. When we add a lens of class, it gives individuals more categories to differentiate and sheds light on differences, not unifying individuals but separating them. This paper will highlight what class is, the effects class has on individuals, and how those effects on society can work out our reality of ourselves. Emphasizing what the looking-glass concept is and how it can relate to the viewpoint of the class.\n\tA direct answer for what social class is is categorizing individuals based on their income. The social class produces a particular collective consciousness of what is poor: lower class, middle class, upper class, and the power elite. Class is disproportionate to income, specifically in America, compared to each individual and their worth. At least 10% of people are below the poverty line (this is just an estimate based on a video shown in class), whereas the top 1% own almost half the nation's income. The point being expressed is that only a few of the below-the-poverty-line individuals are considered poor. However, so many individuals are considered lower or lower-middle-class, but they cannot meet the needs of their lives. This idea highlights how social class is already a place of inaccurately representing the people. At the same time, it is used to determine financial aid for individuals and housing. If this system only represents part of the community, why has it not been changed? Because the people in charge (power elite) who own the majority of the nation's income like this system. The power elite likes this system because it keeps them more prosperous and gives them power and all the choices. Now that social class has been defined, what are its effects on an individual's life?\n\tSocial class significantly impacts opportunities and how life unfolds for individuals. Class is not a topic for discussion in everyday life, but it is apparent in every aspect of life. One's status is far more complex than just how much money a person has, as much as that being the original idea of what class is. Class is not a game where we start at the same point at birth; people start at different points based on things they cannot change (based on race, sex, and sexual orientation, which all impact income). For example, based on a chart in a previous reading, families of color are more likely to be in poverty compared to white families. This discrepancy is much higher if the families are female-led. 1in 3 families of color that are female-led will be in poverty compared to a white family being led by a female, which is 1 in 5, let alone being led by both individuals, which is 1 in 10. Another way social class affects each individual's life is that it can affect education. For example, the same reading talked about how the lower your family's income was, the lower your SAT score was. This phenomenon happens because families with more money can have more resources and plan to help their students the best they can by getting a tutor (SAT prep and other supplemental instruction). Also, social class can affect how an individual looks at life. The family's primary focus for a low-income person is to survive and make ends meet. That adult outlook can bleed to the students because if the parent's primary focus is to make rent, they may not have the funds to help their student in any extra way, and this can cause students to focus more on income and help out parents than focus on education. This whole cycle keeps students focusing on income and not their education, and this becomes prevalent when they get older, and it continues into adulthood and when they have children. This outlook on life affects how others see individuals and how one sees themself. \n\tThe concept of the looking-glass self is how people see themselves through how they perceive someone else. So if Person A believes that Person B may think they are ugly, this can cause Person A to view themself in that way. This same idea can connect with the idea of social class. Because class is apparent in our nation, how others view finances can affect how individuals view their financial place. For example, a person of the upper class thinks that a person of the lower class is filthy, and this upper-class individual does not know that the other Person is lower class. This can change how lower-class individuals view themselves. Because it is prevalent in society, people constantly view themselves based on others.\n\tIn conclusion, class impacts more than just how much money an individual has; it impacts the place one will be in life and how one can view oneself. Through the concept of the looking-glass self, the idea of class is summarized and where it is prevalent in society. Class systems are deeply rooted in society and are a continuous cycle for generations\u2014the effects of this lead to significant views of oneself and others.",

        "text": "SOC \u2013 105\n2 May 2022\nHegemonic Masculinity in America \nIf a nationwide survey were conducted today, how would people answer the question of how men and women should act or look? There are going to be obvious answers that people give, but they are defiantly not correct. Men all over the world are expected to be tall, strong, and manly, while women are expected to wear makeup, look pretty, and are supposed to be in shape. Stereotypes are made for both genders and are unescapable in any way because it happens every day, all around the world. From birth, men and women have been taught to live in a masculine or feminine way. If not, life will be tough and stressful. Hegemonic masculinity is the utmost description used for a male. If a man does not fit this description, he is going to be defined as underlining and unsuitable to society around him. \nFrom the age of three, sports have been a significant part of my life. Without it, I do not know where half of my time would have been in the past. Baseball was, and still is, my favorite sport to play. Ever since I was young, I had some sort of ball in my hand playing around the house. Male athletics is one of the most competitive atmospheres, if not the most. Knowing this, coaches always want to put the best and most athletic players on the field or court. Growing up I have never been the biggest or strongest person that could be used for sports. So, in today\u2019s world, I would not be a good fit to be on the field during a game. Football was always a hardship for me, starting back in middle school. I still remember today the words that came out of the coach during tryouts. He said to a group of us, \u201cSorry, I will not be able to keep you all on the team because of the size difference.\u201d To me, it was extremely unnecessary for him to say that about us. He could have told us to practice harder and come back next year to tryout. Instead, hegemonic masculinity standards were put into place and could have been easily avoided with a different choice of words. \nLife went on and I tried not to think about the time in middle school. It was not until high school when another standard was put onto me. Unfortunately, it was another incident involving football. In high school, I hit a growth spurt, but have never been able to gain as much weight as I needed to, even to this day. It was junior year of high school when our football coach asked a question that was like the statement of my middle school coach. He said to me, \u201cWhen is your body going to get wider?\u201d This remark was made by my coach because the day after I did good at practice the day before, but it still did not help because of the size of my body. I went to a high school where people were favorited in sports due to their last names. So, no matter how good I did in practice or how muscular I was, it was hard to get a starting spot because of my last name compared to other last names, where they sponsored the school and had more money than my family did. \nThere were times when I asked what I could do to get better and hopefully get a starting spot on the team. I did not get many answers, so I started to work out every weekday at school. Working out is one of the main things to do to fit in with hegemonic standards. When everybody expects a guy to be muscular, it pushes you to want to work out so you can fit in. Unbelievably, working out was the one solution that helped me get the starting spot, but it only came during my senior year. I did not have a huge transformation, but it was good enough to help me out with athletics. Football was my only issue when it came to body size. My skills were good enough in baseball to put myself over others. I know I am not the best, but I always looked at where practice beats talent.\nBrett Stoudt was able to explain the \u201cSchool Violence, Peer Discipline, and\nthe (Re)Production of Hegemonic Masculinity\u201d in his article, \u201cYou\u2019re Either In or You\u2019re Out\u201d (Stoudt, 2006). The concept was that hegemonic masculinity is the dominant idea of how a many should act and carry himself. The idea was practiced at a privileged educational school, called Rockport. It consisted of \u201cmostly white, independent boys\u2019 school located in an upper-middle to upper-class suburban region\u201d (Stoudt, 2006). Stoudt argues that hegemonic masculinity was beneficial for the boys of privilege and gave them new opportunities. Even though it is beneficial for the boys, hegemonic masculinity becomes a problem for society because it reinforces toxic masculinity and is normalized in their group, but not in society. Hegemonic masculinity also plays a part in how men expect women to act and look. \nThe standard that these women must meet from men is known as the beauty myth. The beauty myth is a concept that switches roles of gender. It is where women must have an image of beauty for their identity. Not only do men look for the beauty in women, but women themselves compete against each other. This competition between each other has caused female advancement to lack because they have not been able to form a community with each other without the competitiveness of beauty standards placed on them. Women may be suppressed by men, but there are things that goes on by both genders that should not be happening. There should be no beauty standards and no specific way a person should look or act. Everybody was made to be different and not perfect, but the way people are raised could influence how they react to these scenarios about hegemonic masculinity or the beauty myth. \nStereotypes are made every day about cultural norms that should be portrayed, and I feel like stereotypes were made about me. My coaches did not see me as the right fit because I was not big enough to compete with others around me. To me, they used it as an advantage to not let me play as a starter. I practiced hard every day, but never got the chance to because hegemonic masculinity confirmed their beliefs that I was not \u201cbig enough\u201d to play. My school was like Rockport, instead we were not an all-boy school. Even with both genders at our school, we had the upper-class individuals that had the privilege of playing over others. Privileges play a part in hegemonic masculinity, and in the beauty myth, which was another reason I felt like I did not get the playing time I deserved.\nPeople are compelled to fit into cultural norms that are created by both parties. Both genders try to escape these stereotypes, but in today\u2019s world it is harder than it sounds. These scenarios played out exactly how it is explained in my own life. People may not think it influences a person, but until it happens to them, these stereotypes should not be made about men or women. Both genders should start to accept each other the way they are, and one gender should not bash the same gender over standards being made. Change should start to show up soon because if not, the world will stay exactly how it is now, divided.\nWorks Cited\nStoudt, B. G.

        "text": "8613\nSOC 105-007\n1 May 2023\nThe Beauty Myth and Hegemonic Masculinity\n\tDo women truly get treated with the same respect as men? Women are often discriminated against in the workplace, in schools, and in other areas of society. They may be paid less for the same work as men, have fewer opportunities for promotion, and be subject to sexual harassment or other forms of discrimination. Women are often stereotyped as being emotional, weak, or irrational, while men are seen as strong, rational, and in control. This can lead to women being underestimated or overlooked in certain situations. Women are often objectified in the media and popular culture, reducing them to their physical appearance and sexual desirability. This results in women being seen as less valuable or worthy of respect than men. These patterns of unequal treatment are systemic and widespread, and they can have a negative impact on women's lives and opportunities. Due to women\u2019s physical appearance, they are often undervalued, which results in them getting less respect than men and being treated as less than.  \n\tI work at a gym, here at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and in my hometown. There, my job is to observe the patrons and make sure no one gets hurt while working out. I am also required to spot anyone if they ask for assistance. However, if I am working with another male, men tend to ask them for a sport rather than me because I am a female. This is because men tend to perceive women as weaker just because the common stereotype defines men as more well-built and muscular compared to the stereotype of women, who are identified as nurturing and tender.  Most men do not realize that women can be just as strong as men. I lift weights every day and am much stronger than most people realize because of my physical appearance. I am only 5\u20193 and 135 pounds so men may think I look incapable of spotting them because of my appearance. In reality, I am very strong and capable of spotting a male.\n\tNot only have I experienced being judged based on my physical appearance while working at the gym, but I have also experienced objectification by men while working out at the gym. I have had many experiences where I will catch men staring at me or other people will tell me they saw someone creepily staring at me. I have also had men, some much older, come up and flirt with me. Men have followed me around the gym just to stare at me and tried to engage with me in an unwanted way. Men have also made unsolicited comments about my body and appearance in the gym. They have invaded my personal space by standing too close to me or, specifically, one time a man came up behind me while I was squatting and spotted me even though I did not ask for a sport nor did I need one. I have also witnessed these same exact scenarios happen to other females in the gym. All of these go unreported, which allows men to continue to get away with this behavior. \n\tNaomi Wolf explains the beauty myth as the idea that women's value and worth are primarily based on their physical appearance and that there is a narrow, often unattainable standard of beauty that women are expected to conform to. The beauty myth creates unrealistic expectations for women to achieve a particular body type, skin tone, and facial features, often by using makeup, cosmetic procedures, and restrictive diets. According to Wolf, the beauty myth is perpetuated by various industries, including the fashion, beauty, and diet industries, as well as the media. These industries profit from promoting the idea that women must look a certain way to be successful, desirable, and happy. The beauty myth has been criticized for placing unrealistic and harmful expectations on women, which can lead to low self-esteem, body image issues, and even eating disorders. These beauty standards are created by men to objectify all women. \n\tWomen are not the only ones expected to meet high standards, men are also required to be tough, dominating, and aggressive according to hegemonic masculinity. Men who embody these traits are seen as more masculine and are often rewarded with social status and power. For example, a study was done at an all-boy school called Rockport, to see if hegemonic masculinity was beneficial or problematic for these boys. They benefited from hegemonic masculinity because it influenced them into how men are supposed to behave, disciplined them, and gave them a common bond. Men can also use hegemonic masculinity to make women feel less than them by reinforcing traditional gender norms, asserting their dominance, and treating women as objects rather than individuals. Men who treat women as objects to be admired or desired are using hegemonic masculinity to reinforce traditional gender roles. They are perpetuating the idea that women exist primarily for men's pleasure or entertainment, rather than as individuals with their own desires and needs.\n\tPeople often assume that I am physically incapable of certain tasks, such as spotting them in the gym, due to my physical appearance. In the gym, men tend to presume that I am not as strong as a male because of the beauty myth.  This is because men perceive women as weaker due to traditional gender roles and societal expectations. Women are also expected to look a certain way, and I feel as though I fit into the stereotypes that are associated with the beauty myth. This results in me being treated a certain way by men because of my physical appearance. Women who conform to traditional beauty standards may receive more attention and compliments from others, particularly men. Men stare at me, follow me, flirt with me, invade my personal space, and make comments about my physical appearance in the gym, which is one example of the effects of the beauty myth. In these instances, men have also used hegemonic masculinity to make me feel like an object. Men can use hegemonic masculinity in the gym towards women to reinforce traditional gender norms, assert their dominance, and treat women as objects rather than individuals. \n\tMen often treat women differently because of the beauty myth and hegemonic masculinity. I have personally experienced this in my place of work and while working out. Men have made assumptions about my capabilities because of my appearance and common stereotypes created by the beauty myth. While at work, men tend to ask another male working for a spot rather than me because they assume that women are weak when women can be just as strong as men.  Men have also objectified me in the gym by staring, following me, making sexual comments, and unwanted physical contact. By reinforcing traditional gender norms, asserting their dominance, and treating women as objects rather than individuals, men are using hegemonic masculinity to make women feel less than. Standing up to the men that partake in the beauty myth and hegemonic masculinity, would be one step toward preventing men from continuing these acts toward women. We can also speak out against these beauty standards that promote unrealistic body types, skin tones, or other physical features. By not accepting the standards of the beauty myth and hegemonic masculinity, we can put a stop to these stereotypes and unwanted acts committed toward women.  ",

        "text": "2359\n\n\nWe almost all have an iPhone. Most likely we have all had a few and have upgraded every few years. We chase what's new to boost our perceived social status regardless of economic background. We often don\u2019t notice where the products we buy come from. Look at iPhones, predominantly produced in China and under unethical practices and mining techniques. Production has increased at exponential rates due to consumer demand. As demand increases prices become more affordable. These technologies are an example of how McDonaldization has affected other aspects of production technology outside of fast food. Worker surveillance and assembly have exponentially expanded the capabilities of product creation. Alienation is the concept that keeps workers working by subjecting them to unfulfilling tasks that take personal expression out of mass production. Examples of this include assembly lines. A McDonald's assembly station or drive-through keeps employees focused on one task at a time while making individuals work parts to a production line. Factory workers, similarly, to McDonald's employees, are tasked and taught to work on a limited number of tasks, making each step impersonal. Taking self-expression out of production. These practices oppress worker creativity and move away from self-fulfilling goals. This cycle has been created to number the market and force producers to produce and those producers to continue consuming. In class, we watched a commercial for GMC. The Christmas commercial involved a couple buying new cars before the holidays and advertising what seemed to be affordable prices. These prices are marketed to normalize and promote commercial spending. Creating a norm that everyone should be able to buy new cars whenever they want. The promotional advertisement was created to increase spending. Money is power in our society. Through modern technology and marketing strategies, consumerism normalizes and adopts a spending cycle that keeps us spending more.  \nWhat makes meaning? What gives us as humans satisfaction? Consumerism is the narrative that has been socially adopted to bring us enjoyment. Looking at Holidays shows us prime examples of American consumerism in mass accepting quantities. For example, Christmas, gift giving was an almost ancient part of the traditional holiday but recently almost exclusively what surrounds this time of year. During 2023 in the United States, it was estimated that holiday retail sales would reach new levels projected to be around 957 billion dollars (Smith, P.). These figures are outstanding, showing direct relevancy between consumer-based holidays and projected spending levels. But where are these items coming from? Most are made in China with few worker protection programs in place. Looking at kids' toys, more and more easily produced wheeled, scale models, and puzzle toys are coming from China. Toys like this and similar products saw a drastic increase, valued at 17.8 billion dollars in 2021 (Mileva, Geri). Commodity Fetishism increases the consumer's likelihood of purchasing a product to identify with the in-group of consumerism. Manufacturing techniques have created things at rates never seen in previous timeframes. Society has normalized consumer production methods and has created a norm that to find meaning and take part in traditions and holidays we are required to spend money.  \nMeaning is all subjective and marketable. Companies will stop at nothing to get ahead of the curve on trends and automated assembly techniques. In the media, we are bombarded with advertisements for new products making every new thing better than the last. This is done on purpose. Large corporations want us to keep buying. Through the creation and concept of McDonaldization, we can see how technology is advancing at alarming rates. These new practices are also taking away personal value from the employees and instilling a mentality of consumption. We often overlook unsafe and unethical treatment of employees by focusing on the promised outcome the product will give us. These practices have forever changed our country's marketplace through the idealization of consumption and demand for popular products.  \n\nWork Cited\nMileva, Geri. \u201cWhat Does the U.S. Import from China?
