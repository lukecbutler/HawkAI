Many times, this is a negative experience, as children begin to compare themselves against their peers, models in magazines, and modern beauty standards. This can be damaging to both mental and physical health, as such comparisons can lead to the development of eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating. Despite being subjected to similar media and peer groups, eating disorders disproportionately affect young women and girls as opposed to young men and boys. (This is not to say that males are not affected by eating disorders). This brings many to raise the following question: Why do women, young women particularly, get diagnosed with eating disorders so much more frequently than men? The answer to this question is based on how society highly values the way that a woman looks, above all other personal aspects, and does not hold men up to the same standard. Because a woman\u2019s value is seemingly determined by her looks, a phenomenon known as the beauty myth, eating disorders plague younger women and girls and can cause severe mental and physical consequences. \n\tIn my personal experience, eating disorders are incredibly common in my peers. I have distinct memories of sitting at the lunch table with friends in my middle and high school years discussing how we could lose weight, apply makeup, or utilize a number of other beauty treatments. This was characterized by normal \u201cgirl talk\u201d, while boys in the seats across the room were more concerned with whose soccer team they would be on at recess than anything else. Even now as a college student, I frequently witness similar interactions among my peers, specifically in the swim team locker room. Before anyone that I knew was ever diagnosed with an eating disorder, it was commonplace for us all to despise and attempt to improve upon our naturally growing and changing bodies. This age and time period are universally awkward for children as they go through puberty and their body transitions into something new and unknown. This is an incredibly vulnerable and developmentally important time period and the diagnosis of an eating disorder prevents children from maturing in a healthy way. With this being said, eating disorders are also detrimental to the health of people past the age of puberty. Eating disorders frequently prohibit those affected from getting the nutrients that they need to maintain good health.  Also related to this is the concept of diet culture. Diet culture is the societal belief that physical appearance is more important than physical and mental well-being. This concept was widely accepted by my peers by the time I entered middle school, and this culture enabled and continues to enable the development of eating disorders in young women.\nAround the time I turned eighteen, I was diagnosed with bulimia. Growing up, I was always taller and lankier than my peers, and I always stuck out in a crowd. I was incredibly self-conscious about this, so as I got older and my body started to change, I wanted to do everything that I could in an attempt to fit society\u2019s ideal beauty standard. Being tall is typically considered to be unfeminine, and because I was very involved as a competitive swimmer, I was also muscular with broad shoulders, adding to my masculine traits. Many of my friends, and lots of girls my age regularly made fun of me for this, causing me to do everything in my power to prove my femininity and fit the male gaze in other ways. Namely, I started experimenting with makeup, clothes, and weight loss. During this time, I was a healthy weight for my gender and age, but I found myself comparing my body type to the edited pictures of models in bikinis in the media, as well as my more petite peers. Because of this, I certainly felt the pressure to work to conform to society\u2019s beauty standards. There were many factors that eventually led to my bulimia diagnosis, all centered around conforming to society\u2019s beauty standards, and this is something that I still struggle with even today, despite knowing these expected standards of beauty are totally unrealistic. \n\t\tIn order to further understand this, it seems pertinent to examine the work of Namoi Wolf and the concept of the beauty myth. The beauty myth is essentially the standard of the physical appearance of women, and the idea that a woman\u2019s value is determined based on whether or not she meets this standard. It is a sexist ideal that runs our society in an attempt to control women\u2019s bodies and self-esteem. The phrase \u201cit\u2019s a man\u2019s world\u201d is incredibly relevant here, as women are subjected to the beauty myth because our culture is dominated by men\u2019s power and institutions. This is seen in our daily lives, as the beauty myth is perpetuated by social media, advertisements, and other platforms that project unrealistic body expectations for women. The beauty myth is determined by politics and is designed to keep male dominance intact. Since men are trying to maintain dominance, women are forced into society\u2019s standards in order to fight against each other for the resources that men have appropriated for themselves. Additionally, we see that as a woman\u2019s social power increases, so does the beauty standard that she is expected to fulfill. Frequently, this pressure prevents women from reaching their full potential and being the most effective they can be. A different example of how the beauty myth is seen in our society is plastic surgery. The practice of plastic surgery has increased in relatively recent years, but specifically cosmetic surgery is primarily performed on women. Women who undergo breast augmentation, facial lifts, rhinoplasties, or a number of other procedures do so even when it is not medically necessary, but instead, fit society\u2019s definition of beauty. This myth is a travesty in and of itself, but what makes it even worse is that there is no corollary myth for men. While it is true that men strive to have good looks, they simply do not face the same pressures women have to be attractive. Conclusively, the beauty myth is a belief system studied by Wolf that ensures male dominance stays intact in every aspect of society, but actively diminishes the worth of women by judging them solely off of appearance. \n\tOverall, today\u2019s widespread problem of eating disorders, particularly in young women and girls can be explained by the concept of the beauty myth. Because women are only valued in society if they are beautiful in the eyes of men, many women are pushed to attempt to achieve these unattainable standards in extremely unhealthy ways. The idea of the beauty myth is ingrained in the minds of women starting at a very young age, meaning that these unhealthy coping mechanisms frequently develop early, leaving girls with lifelong insecurities as well as worrying mental and psychical health conditions, like eating disorders. It is important to note that driving women to such lengths is simply a sadistic control method to keep men in positions of power and to ensure that women compete with each other instead of with men. It is despicable that this misogynistic belief rules our society, and that young women and girls are forced to suffer the consequences of male insecurity. ",

        "text": "Soc. 105\n29, November 2021\n Religion in a Post-Truth World\n\n     People are born with an innate sense of right and wrong. Where does this come from? Are we born knowing not to steal, lie, and cheat, but do so anyway? Do we know not to hit other kids, or take their toys? What are we told and how do we feel when we do? Where do our ethical and moral choices come from? Harari discusses possible answers to these questions in his book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century in the sections labeled, Secularism, God, Religion, and Post-Truth World. To discover the truth, we must first ask the question, what is truth? Is it simply something we know to be true? Is truth the same for all people? \n     Religion is not something uncommon, or new. It can be seen throughout all corners of the earth, through all different languages, cultures, and societies. Religion is so important, that there are hundreds upon hundreds of differing beliefs, gods, spiritualities, and more. \u201cReligion is a universally and uniquely human phenomenon in that all human societies possess recognizably religious beliefs and practices, but (as far as we can tell) only human societies do so. Together, these observations suggest that religion is closely related to human nature, and perhaps explicable as a function thereof. At the same time, the indubitably social enactment and implications of religion, as well as the socially determined nature of its contents, ensure that any meaningful attempt to explain religion must simultaneously be a sociological exercise.\u201d (Marshall, 2016)   \n   There are many different ways to define \u201ctruth.\u201d There is a spiritual or meditative sense of truth, and then there is personal truth. Lastly there is just truth, in the sense that it aligns with given facts or reality, such as \u201cThe sky is blue.\u201d \u201cOf course the cosmic mystery doesn\u2019t help us at all in maintaining the social order. People often argue that we must believe in a god that gave some very concrete laws to humans, or else morality will disappear and society will collapse into primeval chaos.\u201d (Harari, 2018) \n     Earlier this semester in this class, there were readings and discussions of the Matrix of Domination and Power in America. Both of these can correlate to the previously mentioned sections of Harari\u2019s book by looking at how religion was used to enforce these beliefs and ideas. Harari believes that Religion or God is not actually about \u201cgod\u201d but about humans and that religion is all about stories that give legitimacy and validation to a previously established authority. Also correlating to the collective consciousness, people take this idea of religion and use it to control or have authority over an enormous mass of people. \n      Other important topics by Harari that come into play when discussing these topics are the  ideas of \u201cTruth\u201d and living in a \u201cPost-Truth\u201d world, as well as how that affects how people live their lives ethically and morally today. Without a higher authority, or set of given rules and beliefs to follow, how does society and its people function? We are currently living in a world where truth is more and more often seen as being relative. \u201cWhat\u2019s true for me is not necessarily true for you.\u201d I have my beliefs, you have yours, and that\u2019s that. \n      Is it possible that these collective beliefs and ideas can be harming us? Are they dangerous to this new generation that questions and defies everything because of the media that is presented to them? Why is the truth so important? At first, that may sound like a dumb question. But every day, more and more, little by little, the truth is changing. Government officials lie, companies lie about what's in their food and products, even teachers lie about the subject matter of their choice. Along with the rise of technology and therefore, science, the \u201ctruth\u201d is changing more and more. Everything I was raised to believe as \u201cTrue\u201d has now been challenged, and things that I was told were \u201clies\u201d are now making much more sense than what I was originally taught to believe growing up. \n     In contrast to Harari, Emile Durkheim believed that the societal formation of the collective consciousness furnishes us with both stability and truth.  Because the collective consciousness is not artificial, made by an unspoken agreement of a multitude of groups of people, it is deemed trustworthy. It is embraced because of the fear of being left out, or different, or alone. It is only aware of what it needs to establish authority. Additionally, religion is used as a sort of resource to give meaning or purpose to life.\n    Another large matter when it comes to the importance of religion and truth, is \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cpurpose.\u201d Durkheim's theory of religion is approached from the perspective of his lifelong concern with the question of meaning and moral order in modern society. Really thinking about the reason people exist, and why and how life, community, and the world works scientifically and down to the design of a hummingbird or toucan, or life cycle of a butterfly is extremely important to think about. \n      For Durkheim, the religion of society was important to study because he believed that religion provided social cohesion to help maintain social solidarity through shared rituals and beliefs, social control to enforce religious based morals, and an atmosphere to help maintain conformity and control in society. It has become increasingly likely that religion nowadays is used as a fear tactic to scare people and control them and their actions. For example, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in God? You\u2019re not a christian? Aren\u2019t you scared of hell?\u201d And rather than basing any of their beliefs in fact and/or truth, they use fear and threats to get the collective consciousness to obey their \u201cGod given rules.\u201d \n      To sum up, truth is astronomically important, but we can not use religion as a basis of truth as a force to control others. While Durkheim and Harari both make good points, neither have any one perfect answer to the various questions that are so important. With today's constant and ever-changing technology, media, and ideas and beliefs, truth is something to both be consistently challenged, and researched. \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n21 Lessons for the 21st Century- Yuval Noah Harari, 2018\nhttps://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf\n\nDurkheim on Religion and Moral Community in Modernity- Lise Anne Tolle, January 1993\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-682X.1993.tb00199.x\n\nThe Moral Origins of God: Darwin, Durkheim, and the Homo Duplex Theory of Theogenesis.

        "text": "Rees Kelso\nSoc 105\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n\tThroughout time over the past few decades society has evolved and constantly changed the definition of what it means to \u201cdo gender\u201d, it has become new meanings on what a person needs to do to play the role of your assigned gender just to fit into societies standards, and to be viewed as normal. This has become new standards for women such as how they dress, how they have to act, especially when it comes to a man, and as well as their career path. For men, it has become an image of mainly how they have to act, and especially how they treat women. This normalization of what you should be doing to \u201cdo gender\u201d ultimately has a negative impact on everyone\u2019s lives. \n\n\tI attended a private school for most of my life, so while I was there I witnessed a lot of examples of \u201cdoing gender\u201d. It raised me to believe that these expectations that society has to fit into its standards of how each gender is supposed to play their role were normal. It taught me that if I were to show any emotion it would be seen by people as me being weak and that I would lose my sense as a man. Everyone that I was around all the time in school fit into these roles as well. All of the girls would wear the typical clothing society portrays, such as the short shorts, skirts, tank tops, leggings, and if a girl tried to wear any clothing that would classify them as a \u201ctomboy\u201d, they would instantly be judged by everyone else in the community.\n\n \n\tOn the other hand all of the guys in my school including myself because of how we were raised, and the community we were in based on the school, kind of fit into the typical toxic masculinity role. Ever since the start, we were extremely competitive in everything we did, and even things that were nowhere near a competition, we turned it into one. No matter what was going on in our lives, you would never see any of us show any sort of emotion or sadness, because we did not want to get made fun of, or looked at as weak by all of the other guys. \n\n\tOn top of making things a competition, the atmosphere was extremely hostile towards one another at all times. Although most of us were friends, there was a constant argument and people making fun of other people just to bring them down, to make themselves seem more powerful and superior. It usually tended to work too, because the louder the guy was the fewer guys would talk back to him. \n\n\tThe question to this whole gender role stigma that both genders tend to face, is why this ideology is still practiced and upheld in society. Over time we have broken some of the typical traditions that both genders uphold especially when it comes to females. This goes back to the main three different waves of feminism which have completely changed the outlook on how women are supposed to act in society. \n\n\tFirst wave feminism goes back to starting all the way in the 1870s when women were pushing to change the way America\u2019s voting system worked where women were able to vote. This was important to breaking the chains of sexism and blindly following the idea of \u201cdoing gender\u201d. Women began to realize that they can fight to become more of an equal presence in society, and hold more power. Instead of being seen as others, women fought to show that they are human too and it is not just the man who has power, and has an important role in society. \n\n\tAfter the first wave of feminism, the second wave of feminism began shortly after World War II. Women became tired of not being seen as equals in the workforce, where men could only do the heavy work, and women tended to be stuck being a housewife and care for the husband and family, or do jobs that were seen as \u201cless important in society\u201d. They were able to fight once again and show that they are just as capable of playing an important role in the world, and it is not just men that have the control. \n\n\tFinally, we have the third wave feminism which is still currently an issue, or also known as the sexual revolution. This allowed for a lot more inclusivity for women and to be able to live their lives and express themselves more freely. The consequence of this that I believe can be seen today, is the over-sexualization of women from men as well as in the marketing strategies. Women are now constantly having to deal with issues of catcalling and being seen as objects as well as subjects to sexual harassment. The marketing strategies do not help with this ideology and problem that society faces because they try to use women and the idea of sex appeal to help sell their idea and project. \n\nThis is all part of the idea of \u201cdoing gender\u201d, because both genders fall into this role. Women are raised to believe that they are seen as objects and subjects to men, as bad as it sounds. And men are raised to believe that women are just simply objects and trophies to be shown off and obtained for self-gain and power by men. Now of course not all of society is raised to believe and think this way, but it tends to be the normal idea in smaller more private parts of the world, especially small towns in the south. This is because they keep the idea of how doing gender was seen a long time ago, and that idea just repeats itself over and over throughout generations.\n\nThis is also shown by the writing done by de Beauvoir, of how women are seen as lesser to men and viewed instead as an \u201cother\u201d. She goes on to discuss how men will never bring up their gender or start off something by describing how \u201cI am a man\u201d. She goes on to discuss how no one ever questions the ideology or beliefs a man has, simply because he is a man. But for women, she says from personal experience that women will get judged on their beliefs and told they are incorrect as she says, \u201cYou only think that because you\u2019re a woman.\u201d  This goes to show the daily life and struggle especially as a woman to play this idea of gender roles and to do gender, especially when in society women have always been viewed and treated as inferior. \n\nThe examples of the three waves of feminism are important because it shows that society is capable of breaking ideas of doing gender, and how the two genders have to play their role in society. But it also shows that so far we have been incapable of being able to break this never-ending cycle of there always being some sort of standards in society that the genders have to uphold to be seen as normal. \n\n\nWhat I believe can be learned from this analysis is that society needs to break this cycle that it has created of doing gender, and eliminate our idea as a whole of how we believe a certain gender should act or display themselves. Even the waves of feminism help back this up as well as statistics of mental health disorders and suicide rates of men. This chain will not be broken until both women and men can act how they would like and be viewed by society as equals, where both can have power and influence. As well as men developing the idea of it being okay to show weakness and show their emotion instead of society making them feel like they have to play the power-hungry role as well as the alpha dog role. Society would be better as a whole if we could break the cycle of \u201cdoing gender\u201d and change the meaning behind it because ultimately it does more harm in the world than it does good.\n\n\n\t",

        "text": "\tIn western cultures, hegemonic masculinity is highly valued. This is the classic idea of what a man should be. Hegemonic masculinity refers to a man being physically and mentally strong, providing, wealthy, and emotionless or grounded. This idea of the perfect western man has shaped the way men act in their everyday lives. Men in the western world hold the positions of power, make the most money, but are still often unhappy. Men also lead the statistics in suicide rates and cheating within long-term relationships and marriages. A newer trend shows that young men are having less sex than ever. Are these signs of truly strong people? Many problems that affect men specifically, would be greatly improved by men adopting feminine qualities and behaviors. \n\tIn an attempt to deal with these societal problems, right- leaning parties have advocated for men to become more masculine in order to fight the issues. Masculinity and femininity can be measured on a spectrum. Trying to force men to act more masculine is no more than putting on a facade. This only leads to a further lack of authenticity of character in men, making matters worse.\n\tBoys in the western world are taught to act masculine very early on in childhood. Young males are pushed in the directions of interests such as toy cars, guns, and other manly activities. It would be very interesting to see how something as simple as toy selection would be different if all outside factors were taken out. For example, I grew up with a sister, and toy dolls were just as interesting to me as the toys made for boys. Furthermore, many extracurricular activities that kids engage in are split up by gender. Scouts organizations, sports, and even play groups are often split up by the sexes. We do not see many young boys being signed up for dance classes, yet many men wonder why they feel awkward on a dance floor in their adult lives. In schools, there are awkward dynamics between the sexes. I have memories of fears such as the \u201ccooties\u201d early in school, which embedded in kids to not associate with the other sex. Kids in the western world are conditioned early on to stick to their gender role in society.\n\tBy the time boys reach adolescence, they view the opposite sex as the \u201cother\u201d. Looking back at my highschool experience, many boys including myself found it very difficult to talk to girls, even when there was no romantic interest. We were indirectly conditioned to view women as the \u201cother\u201d, not just people. Many kids have friend groups of one sex. In the case of adolescent boys, they often have superficial relationships with their best friends. It is not uncommon for friend groups of guys to not know major parts of one another\u2019s lives. For example, one of my closest friends did not inform me of his mother having a serious health incident, for weeks. Even when he informed me of the news, it was talked about very briefly and casually. It seems men have difficulty in expressing emotions and feelings with each other. On the contrary, many friend groups of girls know everything about each other. As there is sometimes an issue with this, overall, men would greatly benefit from having deeper friendships with people because they would be able to offer the proper emotional support for one another when times get hard.\nFor a very long time in western society, men\u2019s strongest relationships are with their spouse. Our society tells us that men are meant to save the intimacy and emotional talks for their wives or girlfriends. When have you seen a man crying on his friend's shoulder, aside from someone dying? This can often create unbalanced relationship dynamics, because women often have close friends to share emotions with outside of the romantic relationship. It seems it is very common for moms to have friend groups, but not dads. If I examine my parents\u2019 social lives, my mom has far more friends than my dad. Furthermore, the friends my dad has are either from work, family, or through my mom\u2019s friends. This can create an imbalance in a relationship or marriage because the woman often has more emotional outlets to vent to. Men\u2019s social lives would be greatly improved if they had more platonic friends to spend time with and share emotions with. \nIf we examine the dynamics of men\u2019s romantic relationships in today\u2019s landscape, things have become even worse. In addition to men lacking platonic supportive friendships, young men are failing to establish and maintain romantic sexual relationships. According to The Washington Post, the amount of men under 30 years old who have reported no sex in the last year, has skyrocketed to nearly 30% (Ingraham). Because people meet online more than in person these days, this trend can possibly be blamed on the dynamics of online dating applications. Apps like Tinder reward people based on the \u201cmatches\u201d they get based on purely looks. Unfortunately, it has been theorized that a small percentage of the men on these applications receive the vast majority of all \u201cmatches\u201d. This not only leaves men feeling defeated, but it also reinforces hegemonic masculinity by rewarding the good-looking strong men. If men are struggling to establish romantic relationships , and their platonic friendships are often superficial, how can they properly meet their emotional needs?\nThe final piece of the puzzle in the unhappy man is the way men work for a living. In our western society, men are expected to be the breadwinners for the family. This inevitably leads to men entering tough professions that they may not enjoy. Allocating the majority of one\u2019s time to something they do not enjoy and receive fulfillment from is a recipe for disaster. When this is paired with lacking relationships, the potential for happiness is greatly reduced. Why is it that women are expected to stay home with the kids, yet many of them would like to pursue a career? The gender roles of society put people in lifestyles that are not suited for the individual. Men would be happier if they engaged in projects they truly cared for, with people they want to work with. In recent news, MMA fighter Jon Jones got arrested for domestic violence and damaging a police vehicle. Jones supposedly does what he loves for a living, but is clearly mentally ill and has an unbalanced life. He is the pinnacle of masculinity as he is strong, large, rich, and can literally end almost anyone's life with his hands. However, he is clearly a very unhappy and unsuccessful man. Happy successful people are in touch with their emotions, have a great support system, and engage in activities they truly enjoy.  Toxic masculinity standards do not strengthen people, it puts them in shackles from reaching their own destiny.\nAs stated earlier, the early years of a kid's life is very important in how the gender roles are enforced subconsciously. In order for boys in society to adopt more healthy feminine behaviors, it will be beneficial to teach these early on. The example of gendered toys was used earlier, but the issue is much deeper rooted. We must teach young boys the importance of building emotional management skills. Boys need to know that it is healthy to express emotions, even if this means crying or \u201cappearing weak\u201d. It will also benefit children when they are taught to socialize with the other sex. Splitting up the sexes does more harm than good as it creates strange dynamics early on that are hard to break.\nNext, we must teach children the importance and skills of building friendships. We learn how to treat others with respect as kids, but it rarely goes much deeper than this. Young boys must learn how to share emotions with friends and family, instead of being taught to toughen up, which just teaches people to keep emotions bottled up. This extra education would hopefully lead to male students building meaningful relationships with peers, where they can freely share their emotions.\nThese healthy relationships must carry into adolescence and adulthood for men. When school, careers, and social aspects get harder as we get older, the relationships become more important than ever. Healthy platonic relationships lead to healthier and happier men, who are more effective in society.\nFinally, men must engage in activities and possibly careers that are mentally fulfilling to them. In a perfect world, finance and gender roles will have minimal influence on the decision someone makes. However, more realistically we can hope that men pick careers that are sustainable mentally. We want to shift the paradigm away from teaching men that they must run themselves into the ground in order to provide for the family. People must engage in more healthy lifestyles with balance, in order to be socially productive in society.\nIn conclusion, toxic masculinity creates many issues for men and the people around them in society. As many believe this is due to men being weak or too feminine, more femininity may actually be the key. Gender role conditioning begins at  a very young age, so if we focus less on these roles, and more on mental/emotional health and social skills, we will raise more socially efficient people. Also, it will be beneficial to let kids explore interests they actually enjoy and are drawn too, rather than grouping activities by the sexes. This way, kids can try multiple things and get new perspectives on who they truly are. Moving into adolescence and adulthood, men must continue to build social and emotional skills. Many men struggle to share emotions and keep things bottled up until it is too late. Women seem to socialize and support one another far more often, so men should follow their lead. Finally, we must inspire men by getting them to see the value of doing things that are fulfilling to them as individuals. This will shift some stress away from men, leading to a happier overall society.   \n\nReferences\nIngraham, C. (2019, March 29). The share of Americans not having sex has reached a record high.

        "text": "Alayna Krimminger\nSOC 105\n02/17/2021\nEssay 4\nThe argument I will use to explain Peggy McIntosh\u2019s argument is the idea of \u201cCollective Consciousness\u201d from Emile Durkheim. From Durkheim and collective consciousness, we see \u201cCollective Representation,\u201d which to me seems to be the best explanation for the arguments in the reading for this week. Collective Representation can only be created from the group of people who believe it to be so\u2014this belief held by a group of people forms from human interaction patterns over time. From McIntosh, we see that the white privilege is very real to everyone except white people. Still, white people and the question of racism will not be answered until white people realize that there is a distinct privilege given to them based on their skin color. \nThis week, we focused on the Sociology of Race and, like collective consciousness, the idea of race is socially constructed. From the times of ancient Rome, we first see \u201cracism\u201d at a \u201clocal\u201d level because the Romans got along with the Egyptians and the Persians, two groups of people with a darker complexion and on the other hand, we see the lack of respect towards the Germanic people because they were seen as uncivilized.  Racism during ancient times was based on if your civilization had laws and wasn\u2019t running wild. From Rome, we move into European cities, which saw the term \u201cwhiteness\u201d as a ranking in society. This idea that \u201cwhiteness\u201d had a higher social standing then turned into the idea that anyone who was not white had no social place, and it was questioned if they should be deemed human or not. Racism is a collective consciousness created hundreds of years ago to put white people at an advantage over black people. We see this argument presented in Peggy McIntosh\u2019s \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d.  In this essay, we know how the author compares male privilege to white privilege using the fact \u201cwhites are carefully taught to not recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege.\u201d I believe that the idea of Collective Consciousness and Collective Representation is responsible for this unspoken fact that white people have a leg up in a society based on the ancient ideology that communities can be uncivilized and civilized.\nConsidering the fact that white people created the Collective Conscious and Collective Representation for white people. White people have created a society for white people, and black people have created a society for black people, but somehow a white person took the \u201cforeign\u201d society and said, \u201cthat\u2019s wrong\u201d therefore white people must force this \u2018foreign\u201d society to conform into the white culture for it to be civilized\u2014that is the collective consciousness of racism and white people are responsible for this consciousness. Suppose you compare the population's size for white people to the population of black people and many other races found in a community, the number of white people in a given society most likely outnumbers any other race; therefore, assimilating the races to conform to the idea that unless your white, you do not have a chance to earn the high ranking. This ideology is responsible for racism still be present in 2021; until white people realize that white privilege is real, society stands no chance at defeating the disease of racism. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105-01\n29 November 2021\nComparing Harari\u2019s Views to Sociological Study\n\tIn Harari\u2019s \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century,\u201d he shares his views on the many controversial problems of the global society. Harari shares personal viewpoints and experiences, historical references, and social science to deeply explain where he stands. Harari\u2019s text provides an updated view of sociology, compared to the most popular dated sociologists. This essay will highlight and explore contradictions between Harari and Durkheim on the topic of religion in a society and moral compasses. Next, the essay will dive into the many similarities between Harari and Mantsios regarding their views on hierarchal structures in societies and equality. \nIn Durkheim\u2019s \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations,\u201d he argues that religions were important in creating the many ways that a society functions. Durkheim credits religion with developing the peak of societal function. Durkheim stated, \u201cIn fact, we have seen that if collective life awakens religious thought on reaching a certain degree of intensity, it is because it brings about a state of effervescence which changes the conditions of psychic activity\u201d (Durkheim 73). Durkheim describes the vast power religion has in conjunction with the intensity of socialization and group thought. Durkheim goes on to explain morals and human thought, \u201cHence the individual at least obscurely takes account of the fact that above his private ideas, there is a world of absolute ideas according to which he must shape his own; he catches a glimpse of a whole intellectual kingdom in which he participates, but which is greater than he.\u201d Durkheim believed that religions provide people with the collective consciousness of \u201ctruth\u201d. The individual has the power to interpret the truth, but they can\u2019t truly choose and decide what the truth is. Durkheim credits religion heavily for being the moral compass of people, guiding individuals in their beliefs of what is wrong or right in any situation. \nHarari has a far different take on how religion functions in a society, and how individuals form a moral compass. Harari explains, \u201c\ufeffThere are no \u201cMuslim\u201d or \u201cJewish\u201d positions here. Humankind is likely to be divided into two main camps\u2014those in favor of giving AI significant authority, and those opposed to it. Muslims and Jews are likely to be found in both camps, and to justify whichever position \ufeffthey espouse through imaginative interpretations of the Quran and the Talmud\u201d (Harari 119). Harari does not believe that religion spawns individuals\u2019 beliefs and morals. As he explained, there will always be people from all religions on both sides of any given political debate. Furthermore, Harari argues that people\u2019s moral compasses do not come from religion. Harari also goes on to argue that science and medicine is the key to successful human evolution, not organized religion. People from all places and cultures will all come to similar conclusions of what is truly important in life. Harari gives credit where is due and explains how religion has positives such as bringing people together in positive ways. Harari also explains some negatives to religion, \u201c\ufeffOther religious traditions fill the world with a lot of ugliness and make people behave meanly and cruelly. There is little to be said, for example, in favor of religiously inspired misogyny or caste discrimination\u201d (Harari 121). Harari uses both pros and cons of religion as a whole, to demonstrate that society and individuals can easily operate efficiently without the need for organized religion.\nDurkheim believed that religion was pivotal in shaping societal structures and human evolution, as Harari believes religion was only a byproduct of the evolving individuals and societies. Durkheim highlighted how collective consciousnesses and collective representations create culture and community in a society. On the contrary, Harari explains how religion is more so just a story, behind the true reality. The things that shape reality are science, medicine, and politics. Harari views the effects of religion on society with an open mind, while still being critical of its darkest aspects. On the contrary, Durkheim explains how religion shaped and pushed societies into growth.\nGregory Mantsios and Harari have very similar views on class hierarchy systems in the global society. In Gregory Mantsios\u2019 \u201cClass in America,\u201d he explains a common myth \u201cRich or poor, we are all equal in the eyes of the law, and such basic needs such as health care and education are provided to all regardless of economic standing.\u201d (Mantsios 183).  Mantsios debunks this myth early in the reading, to show how we are supposed to view the United States. He explains that American values want us to believe that everyone is equal even though that is far from reality. We are taught about the American dream growing up, and this idea is meant to make people feel like everyone has an equal deck of cards dealt to them. Mantsios uses statistics to show how unequal the United States really is, such as 1 in 5 children ages 1-6 are living in poverty. This stat was a clear example of how unequal circumstances are in America, debunking the myth very easily. Mantsios also explains how the United States is notorious for wealth inequality. He explains how the country has very rich people, and very poor people. Mantsios states, \u201cThe income gap between rich and poor in the United States (measured as the percentage of total income held by the wealthiest 20 percent of the population versus the poorest 20 percent) is approximately 12 to 1, one of the highest ratios in the industrialized world.\u201d (Mantsios 185). Mantsios wants readers to be aware of how glaringly obvious income in equality is in the country, our middle class is very sparce. He goes on to illustrate 3 different lifestyles, using characters. One character represents upper class with many privileges such as knowing powerful people, growing up rich, and attending private schools. The next character is from a middle/working class family and attended public schools with people of a similar background. This Character went on to trade school and graduated in 2 years. The final character is from the lower class from a family that struggles to make ends meet. This character attends the worst schools of the 3, and eventually had to drop out of trade school due to poverty.  The 3 different lifestyles accurately represent how unfair financial circumstances and opportunity are. In America we are taught that we all have an equal opportunity at success, but this is far from reality. Harari would agree with Harari that we live in an unequal world.\nIn the \u201cEquality\u201d chapter of Harari\u2019s book, he explains how even though the world is more equal than it was before 1900, it is still tremendously unequal financially. Harari explains some very similar stats to Mantsios, \u201c\ufeffToday, the richest 1 percent own half the world\u2019s wealth. Even more alarmingly, the richest one hundred people together own more than the poorest four billion\u201d (Harari 72). These statistics and the statistics used by Mantsios show the clear similarities in the 2 authors\u2019 views on wealth inequality. Harari ties in the current landscape of global wealth inequality to the imminent danger of artificial intelligence. Harari makes it clear in earlier chapters that AI will one day help the richest powerful people do what they do today, on a larger scale. This means that inequality will likely become even more drastic than today! Harari explains one of his fears regarding the elite utilizing AI in the future, \u201c\ufeffWhile up until now they have only been able to \ufeffbuy little more than status symbols, soon they might be able to buy life itself. If new treatments for extending life and upgrading physical and cognitive abilities prove to be expensive, humankind might split into biological castes\u201d (Harari 72).  If this hypothetical from Harari becomes true, the global issue of wealth inequality would become even more intense.\n\tHarari and Mantsios both prove how crippling wealth inequality is in the United States and the global society. Both Mantsios and Harari address how these inequalities are extremely apparent and real, regardless of if we were intended to see. Powerful elite people obtained wealth through power and opportunity, not necessarily from pure hard work and grit. In the future, AI and advanced technology may aid the powerful elite in becoming even more powerful. If medicinal advances and technology combine to extend life, the elite will be the first to reap the benefits of the new privileges. This will lead to even more unequal opportunity across societies, bridging the gaps between classes even bigger. It would be very interesting to see hypothetical characters similar to Mantsios\u2019. But instead, the rich character has even more layers of privilege such as the best medical care including robotic organs. As Harari stated, things are more equal today, but we may be headed in the wrong direction.\n\tHarari\u2019s \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d navigates the main global societal problems. We found that his views both aligned and contradicted other sociologists. Harari had very critical views on religion, as he compared it to the oldest form of \u201cfake news\u201d.  As on the contrary, authors like Durkheim credited religion with shaping the successful societies of the world. Harari acknowledges religion for sometimes bringing people together in a positive light, but he views the cons such as oppression to be far worse. Also, Harari believes all religions their cultures/societies to very similar end points. Harari was still able to align with modern sociologists like Gregory Mantsios on the issue of wealth inequality. The 2 authors had very consistent views on the causes and depth of the issue, and Harari took it a step further by hypothesizing and expressing concern for how the problem could worsen in the future. Harari\u2019s lessons went very in-depth, inevitably meaning that he would find consistent and inconsistent bases with other renowned sociologists. \nReferences\nHarari, Y. N.

With the rise of technology throughout the past few centuries, individuals have expressed the idea of putting on a show. This may be for a TV series, movie, social media, or YouTube. However, I think social media has had the most significant effect on individuals and the way that they act to express themselves in front of others. These individuals express themselves in a way that receives more likes and views. This idea goes hand-in-hand with Goffman\u2019s concept of \u201cThe Presentation of Self.\u201d This essentially states that individuals present themselves as on a \u201cstage\u201d performing to the world in different situations. Depending on the situation, a different need must be met. Everyone plays a part in collectively forming a situation. With so many different roles to fill, Charles Cooley\u2019s idea of \u201cThe Looking Glass Self\u201d shapes the way that individuals see themselves as a single living being through the eyes of others. This relates to the idea that individuals present themselves in a sense that fits the needs of other people. With society\u2019s functioning on the line, everyone\u2019s characters must line up to create a single, flawless symphony, which creates the life and world we know today. \n           For as long as I can remember, my mom has told me to understand and read my audience. Until about a year ago, I had absolutely zero clue as to what she meant deep down by saying it. It was when I began maturing when I really understood the deeper meaning behind this. I have a role to play, and depending on the situation, my role will vary. For instance, in a professional conversation at work, I must be attentive, clear, concise, and direct. Opposed to when I am hanging out with my friends, where I can act any way that I want, within boundaries. In terms of Goffman, I will present a part of me that is shown through my respected audience providing the character that best fits the situation. It is a simple idea, but in a social setting, it can really make the difference as to who I am looking to impress. \nFor instance, I want to undergo a profession in healthcare, and I thankfully live in an area where healthcare workers happen to also live. When I have spoken to, say, physicians, I must play my part as an intelligent, young individual looking to pursue a similar career as them. However, this is not where that ends. The physician I am speaking to must play the role of a provider, a lifesaver, and a respected individual without flaw. \nGoing back to the idea that social media has shaped our world into the way that people perceive information along with give it off, each person is given a role based on what they post about. For instance, models have the job of posting images that make them look good to support and to promote clothing companies. Opposed to me, where I post videos of me riding a scooter. No matter the content that an individual puts out in the world, the idea behind it is to be seen posing as someone that will attract views and likes. This goes into the idea of \u201cThe Looking Glass Self.\u201d One quote stated by Cooley proposes the idea that \u201cThe thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another\u2019s mind\u201d (Cooley). This really speaks towards a lot of the emotions that one possesses. The idea behind this is to provide a positive image of yourself in the eyes of the people around you. An individual will change the way they are to fit the social structure of a group of people to answer three questions. How will they appear to others? What will people think of them? Are they liked?\nHumans are defined as social creates, and embarrassment drives a lot of factors in our lives. One emotion that is portrayed through Goffman\u2019s stage representation is embarrassment. Depending on the social situation, the embarrassment may come from anyone in a group of people. Goffman states that embarrassment occurs when an individual\u2019s role has been discredited. This relates to the idea that each person in a situation is promoting the roles of every other person to collectively create a stage that flows well. I particularly remember the day we showed up to class, and Dr. Elliott showed up without his notes. The role of the teacher had essentially been failed. The students in the room played the role as individuals ready to learn from the professor. All the roles were there, but the role of the professor was not played as intended. For this example, the class did not know what to do next as the situation was not played correctly. With one role having been played incorrectly, everyone felt embarrassed for the awkward interaction.\nI have had multiple hobbies in my life, switching from scootering, to diving, and to, now, weightlifting. Therefore, the content that I post on social media has varied over the past few years. Every time I post something unlike the previous post, I feel off about posting it. Is this something I want my followers to see? Will I get the same amount of likes and view? Will I lose followers? All of these things are irrelevant, but to the importance society has placed on numerical values on social media, it means everything.\nSocial media, however, influences the lives of individuals by posing as another audience to please. Cooley states \u201cEach to each a looking-glass Reflects the other that doth pass\u201d (Cooley). In terms, this reflects the idea that people look at others as a mirror as to who they are as a person. Each interaction possesses the ability to shape the way we view our role and beliefs in the world. This backs the idea that identity comes from within. Social media, in this sense, reflects the way we see ourselves. As we receive more views, likes, and positive comments, we understand that our roles are being fulfilled. Going along with Cooley\u2019s quote, Goffman states that \u201cthe means for producing and maintaining selves do not reside inside the peg; in fact, these means are often bolted down in social establishments\u201d (Goffman). With such an important idea behind producing and maintaining the self in a social establishment. In terms of preventing embarrassment, the stage is then broken up into two parts. The backstage along with the front stage. The backstage, according to Goffman, refers to the social places where people prepare to be on the front stage. The front stage is the production of a social situation, in which each person plays a point.\nInstagram and all these other means of social media have been a driving factor in the shaping of today\u2019s society. Both Cooley\u2019s idea of the \u201cLooking Glass Self\u201d and Goffman\u2019s \u201cPresentation of the Self\u201d correlate to the way that individuals act in a social situation. In my opinion, the attitudes and representations in which people perform have changed significantly from life before technology. There are more social standards that must be followed along with the high need for reinforcement. The \u201cLooking Glass Self\u201d plays a part in all waking function human beings perform today. How will this affect me? Will I gain attraction? But, at the end of the day, all anyone is looking for is an applause for their performance.\n\nWorks Cited\nCooley, Charles Horton. \"The Looking-Glass Self.\" The Human Nature and the Social Order.

        "text": "SOC 105\nFirst Reflection Essay \n\n\tIt is not often that a person has the chance to experience and observe the workings of white privilege from both sides of the equation. Growing up in an interracial family has opened my eyes to exactly how my fair skin benefits me in life, and how my siblings\u2019 dark skin disadvantages theirs. White privilege is often not realized or willingly acknowledged by many people of the Caucasian race. As Peggy McIntosh states in White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack, \u201cWhite privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools and blank checks.\u201d (30) I never fully comprehended the amount of advantages I had growing up in the dominantly white United States until the adoption of my siblings, who are both from Ethiopia, Africa, and are currently middle and high school age. Hearing the experiences and concerns of my siblings opened my eyes to the following: white privilege does indeed have a concrete existence in our everyday lives, created through the systemic racism present in American society, and our unwillingness to recognize such privilege only fuels that system further. \n\tA distinct memory I have from when I was around eight or nine years old is constantly being praised for adopting my brother and sister. When sharing that I have two adopted siblings to someone new, I was often told something along the lines of, \u201cThat is so great of your family!\u201d or, \u201cI bet they are so thankful for what you\u2019ve done for them.\u201d Even from such a young age, I always found the comment strange. In recent years I realized it was because it is coming from a privileged and \u201cwhite savior\u201d perspective, whereas I never saw their adoption through that lens. The adults who praised me most likely did so because, in their eyes, my siblings were lesser and needed our saving. White it is true that they came from a poor country with less opportunity, there are many people living in Ethiopia under the same circumstances who have never known any different. My parents did not adopt with the intentions of being praised or receiving thanks, but rather felt that their faith called them to expand our family through the adoption process. This viewpoint was the beginning of my realization of how much privilege white people receive in our country, to the extent that we place ourselves on a pedestal for opening our homes to those of a different race. \n\tAnother example of this privilege is that I\u2019ve never realized that I have been surrounded by people of my race for my entire life. My parents sent me and each of my siblings to private school for most of our education, and I never realized that there virtually no students of color in the school until my brother or sister would mention it. The school setting made them feel different and outside of the normal, whereas I never gave it a second thought because almost every other peer looked like me. I recall my sister being sad because the only other black girl in her grade was not playing basketball, so she was the only person of color on the team. Nearly all of my siblings\u2019 friends are white as well, taking away that shared experience of being the same race that can create a special connection. While it is of course a good thing to have a diverse friend group, I have never had the issue of not having any friends of the same race as me, something that I would surely miss if that was the case. I have always had the privilege of being within the dominant racial group in the United States, making it easy for me to be surrounded people who are also white. We are taught from a young age that, in our society, skin color has meaning and is a means of interconnection between people of a like race. Whereas I have always had access to that connection, my siblings have not, and therefore feel isolated and abnormal at times because of it. \n\tThe final example is one many people of all races have finally begun to pay attention to, and that is the often unfair treatment of black people by law enforcement and other authorities in the United States. My parents have had to initiate talks with my brother and sister about exactly how to behave when within the same area as law enforcement, especially when driving. Sentences such as \u201cNever move your hands from the wheel,\u201d and, \u201cAnnounce every action you are about to perform, so they don\u2019t think you are trying to run or pull out a weapon,\u201d have been told to both siblings many times. My sister just obtained her driver\u2019s license very recently, and once again had to be given the same talk. It might seem tedious and dramatic to some, but it is a real fear for black people every day. This fear is something I have never had to experience or be warned about. These fears carry over into other aspects of my siblings\u2019 everyday life. My brother must be told not to act foolish with his white friends, even if they are behaving that way, in case he gets singled out by a person of authority, such as a police officer, or even a teacher. As he gets older, he is not supposed to walk or ride his bike around our predominantly white neighborhood alone, for fear of having someone call the police for trespassing despite our family living there for over seven years. I get in the car to drive, or take my dogs for a walk, without a second thought of how the color of my skin could put me in a position of danger. This is yet another example of the seemingly invisible privilege white people have simply due to their race. \n\tHow do we know that this is white privilege and not just a handful of random experiences? Peggy McIntosh better explores these advantages in her previously mentioned text, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack. In her writing, she provides a self-made checklist of assumptions and benefits she feels she inherently receives a right to because of her whiteness. This checklist was made based off of observing what freedoms and things assumed to happen in everyday life that McIntosh\u2019s African American women coworkers did not have access to. \n\tMany of these checklist points correlate to the paralleled experiences between me and my siblings, showing that their experiences and my advantages are not just random or individual. For example, my brother and sister feeling alienated at school corresponds with the privilege McIntosh describes when stating, \u201cI can go home from most meetings of organizations I belong to feeling somewhat tied in, rather than isolated, out of place, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance, or feared.\u201d (33) I have always had the comfort of being surrounded by people of the same race as me in nearly all settings of my life, whereas my siblings do not often have that assurance. \n\tSeveral other points on Mcintosh\u2019s list also coincide almost directly with the extra obstacles put in place for my siblings because of their dark skin. These inherent advantages are \u201cI can be pretty sure that my neighbors in a new location will be neutral or pleasant to me the day I move in,\u201d (31) and, \u201cIf a traffic cop pulls me over [\u2026] I can be sure I haven\u2019t been singled out because of my race.\u201d (33) As previously mentioned, my siblings have to take extra precautions when performing simple tasks such as driving or walking in our neighborhood, just to be seen as a nonthreat to certain people. While these advantages white people receive seem like they should be the normal standard for all (and often are assumed to be afforded to all by white people), this is actually not the case. \n\tMcintosh begins to expand on how United States systems of government attempt to keep these unearned privileges hidden from white people, as a means to keep them blissfully ignorant in order to continue to support and stand by white-controlled institutions through \u201cconferred dominance.\u201d (34) This gives whites power over other racial groups due to unequal distribution of wealth and assets. Because this realization of the privileges white people receive has been kept from those of the Caucasian race for so long, accepting that such advantages exist becomes a difficult concept to grasp. \n\tThere are many white people, such as my grandparents, who have grown up in poor communities with little opportunity. To get out of the situation they were born into, many have had to work hard for what they have in life, following the classic \u201cAmerican dream\u201d and \u201cbootstraps mentality.\u201d Because of this, white people in such a position often deny having such privilege, because they assume privilege only comes from a place of wealth and material possession when, in reality, they were already at an advantage to pull themselves out of poverty because of the color of their skin.\n\tMcIntosh also describes a feeling similar to what I experienced when first discovering my inherent privilege, that makes the concept even harder to grasp. Growing up in America, we are taught that we live in a democratic society that provides equal opportunity for all, despite religion, race, age, and many other attributes. With the full acknowledgement of white privilege, Mcintosh states the all too familiar feeling of discovering the hidden truth, saying, \u201cIf these things were true, this was not such a free country; my life was not what I had made it; many doors opened for my people through no virtues of our own.\u201d (33) This is what can make the acceptance of the existence of white privilege so daunting, because citizens of the United States are told one streamlined version of history, often leaving out the ugly truths and systemic inequalities that led to the creation of the nation. While people of color realize these inequalities from a young age, white people have often never had to reflect on them because we have no prior experience or knowledge of the inconsistencies within our society. \n\tWithout listening to and observing the experiences of my siblings, as well as the behavior and opinions directed towards my brother and sister by white people, I would have most likely remained blissfully ignorant of the privileges I have access to in my everyday life due to my skin color. This is why it becomes extremely important for white people to willingly listen and acknowledge the experiences of people of color in our countries, because it can be a vital way to understand and recognize the privileges we as white people inherently receive in our systemically racist society. However, McIntosh relays one important message in her writing: \u201cDisapproving of these systems won\u2019t be enough to change them.\u201d (35) The first step to redesigning the systems of American society that put white people at an advantage is to accept that such systems and advantages exist in the first place. \n\tIn conclusion, the existence of white privilege in the United States is not just an opinion, but rather a tangible concept. This privilege provides white people with advantages, as well as access to basic rights and freedoms, that people of color in the nation are not awarded. Recognizing these privileges can be difficult, because American society attempts to keep white people unaware and denying of such advantages in order to maintain white dominance over other racial groups. Through the simple act of paying attention and being inclined to listen to those who are oppressed by white privilege, it can become quite clear that it does indeed exist. Acceptance of this concept is the first step in attempting to redefine the racially discriminatory systems white privilege was built within. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

        "text": "Alayna Krimminger\nSOC 105\n02/01/2021\nEssay Brief 2\nThe Conception of Self\nWhen a professor asks a question in class and one feels confident enough to think \u201cI know this, I can answer this 100%\u201d what is the determining factor in whether that person raises their hand to answer the professor\u2019s question in front of the whole class? That factor in which we as humans always seem to lose faith in ourselves in fear of somehow getting the question that you know is correct wrong is called the Conception of Self. The first reading I am going to use is George Herbert Mead\u2019s \u201cThe Self, The I, and the Me\u201d. In the reading it becomes three different concepts; the \u201cI\u201d is the part of our brains that responds to stimuli being presented to us from the environment (like the example used previously) knowing the answer to a question when asked. The \u201cMe\u201d is the part of our brains that evaluates what this stimulus is and how it will be affecting us, the \u201cWhat if it\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t raise your hand\u201d. The \u201cSelf\u201d is the part of our brains that exerts the emotions from the conversation between the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cMe\u201d part of our brains. The self in the classroom situation would be feeling unconfident/nervous to answer the question due to the argument between the \u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe\u201d.\nNow take the \u201cI\u201d, \u201cMe\u201d, and \u201cSelf\u201d and consider Erving Goffman\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation of Self\u201d. In Goffman\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation of Self\u201d we see that the performance of the \u201cI\u201d, \u201cMe\u201d and \u201cSelf\u201d depends on the type of interaction we are having. The literal presentation of one\u2019s self solely depends on the audience. For example, my thought process for driving to school and my thought process driving home from school are two totally different fields. \nThose two concepts are responsible for the way we create a standard for ourselves in different settings. By using the Conception of Self-concept, we as humans have created a safety net for our own thoughts and actions. When we are with our families, we are going to act a lot different than we would if we were with friends, or if we were in the presence of our teachers or our employers, our brains have created different \u201cmodes\u201d based on the constant internalized conversation we have with ourselves every second of every day when we make decisions.

        "text": "SOC 105\nNovember 29, 2021\n20 Lessons about the 21st Century\n\tIn his book called the \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century\u201d, Harari goes over many relevant topics that happened in this time period and gives his thoughts on how we should individually. He lists many controversial things that we should be aware of and more importantly, presents information to us that is very useful. From what I read, I thought that most of what was written was consistent from what was being said and found these ideas to be true. However, there was one idea on the science fiction chapter that I disagree with and found myself to be confused at his point. \n\tNow onto the consistencies. The topic I wanted to talk about is the religion chapter because it ties in together with their relevancy and importance. The book itself is about modern lessons about certain topics and this is one of the controversial ideas that have lasted since forever. Moving on, religion has lasted seemingly ever since humans came about. What Harari talks about now is that religion is irrelevant towards current complications and is no longer useful to modern society. He states that present issues related to more scientific data such as climate change and drought prevention can not be solved by religion. Religions like Christianity were utilized in medieval times where science has not been found to work, so people turned to religion. It made sense that people during previous eras would turn into things like faith in order to have a chance at survival. However, times have changed and now religion\u2019s ideas are not very applicable to today. The main idea of the chapter was that humans past that time period had made many achievements scientifically and now we know that religion has no impact in our lives anymore. \nIn terms of economics, religion seemed to play a similar role here with science. For instance, in countries such as Israel or Iran when a religious figure has power in a given decision, Harari points out that these rabbis will turn to people who are known to have intelligence in economics, such as Karl Marx as opposed to using religion first. He also tells us that rabbis have little understanding of how economics work and the possible consequences for an unaware mistake. It is clear to the reader that religion serves a different purpose in these specific scenarios and they not nearly accurate enough for even religious figures to make a defined statement that is solely based on old scripture. \n\tThe reason I wanted to talk about religion is how it ties to the overall message about the book, and it does so with numerous chapters. In the work chapter, Harari goes on to say that artificial intelligence is something to think about with many positives and negatives. He says that AI was a major breakthrough in human progression and has seen a lot of promise because of its capabilities. Noting that self-driving cars are almost a thing now, job positions could be taken over, and even chess players are being outplayed. The reason why I think it is similar to the religion chapter is the way Harari tries to inform the audience about these modern topics. Harari wants us to learn about the future pros and cons these ideas can have and what a person in this time period can look forward to. In terms of religion, he wants us to figure out that religion has been dwindling over the past centuries and specifically now. He does this by giving us fundamentals about the overall perspective and how that plays into why this certain event is happening if not informed already. \n\tWhat was religion about, and could it be used to solve current objectives? Harari gives us a fully fleshed answer and provides many examples, but basically says no unless we adapt it. How does religion impact society and where can it be used today? He gives a pro example, Japan, and a negative example, North Korea. What is AI and could it be used to solve current objectives? Again, tells us briefly, but down to the point that AI can do such things. How does AI impact society and how could it be used today? AI has the potential to change a lot of things from different aspect in good and bad ways. He wants us to take this information and calculate that based on a reader\u2019s current situation, which was why I fell in love with this book. As a person living in the 21st century after reading this book, will I turn to religion? After hearing what religion is really about, probably not. Will I investigate artificial intelligence? Given the information, probably. He shows importance in upcoming events and how they mold into the current world. This shows us that he wants the reader to think critically about what is happening and what we take from it. Another thing to note about his writing is that everything he writes is pretty much open-ended. There is no real main idea of each chapter, instead he simply tells us the information we need along with the observations he found and how that plays individually that supports this learning process.\n\t Alternatively, Harari wants us to have our own individual perspective on ideas previously shown to us but were shaped by other factors like school. For example, school taught us about the red scare along with how communism was not successful and actually lead to horrible things. But to the author, he actually credits Karl Marx as an economic intellectual in the religion chapter and possibly wants us to look more into such ideas. He is telling us information that could be used by us, but it has to be looked at properly and rationally. It is kind of saying that \u201cgood\u201d things can be taken from \u201cbad\u201d things. It seems that this whole book is a learning process that is interpreted by the individual. Just because Karl Marx created an idea that sprouted fear and war among countries. That does not necessarily mean that what he wrote was intentionally evil. I am trying to say that school could have shaped students to think that everything communistic was bad, but Harari shows a different perspective that makes the reader ponder. This was an important thing he went over in the education chapter where he stressed critical thinking. \n\tAs for the inconsistencies, I disagreed with the science fiction chapter as it did not seem to have that impact compared to the religion and work chapter and sounded confusing because of how it was interpreted by the author. He starts off by saying movies such as the Matrix do not have accurate representations of the realistic future and because of that lead to false misinterpretations by society. Personally, I did not consider that fact at all, not because it was something incorrect, but more of that I had no idea people thought these movies literally depicted the near future. To me, anything science fiction is a what if scenario. For example, the Matrix shows a specific event that humans become enslaved by intelligent robots and live in a separate false reality. From my point of view, I see the Matrix as a possibility of the outcome of humans unable to control AI and end up being inferior to them, a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. The way Harari interpreted it was very technical. He states that \u201cvery little people look at the latest breakthroughs in technology but learn about AI from movies like the Matrix\u201d (Chapter 18). It seems like Harari knows a lot about what is happening in the Matrix from a realistic perspective. But that does not always mean that is should be changed to suit those something real. A great way to display those ideas the author shared is to show data about how many people really believe these movies to be true and then go off on his statements. Instead, he goes off an assumption that people really believe these things true and causes a lot of confusion. \n\tThe word fiction in science fiction is there for a reason and I think Harari missed the point of these movies. Another example would be Marvel movies. Marvel movies have a bit of science fiction added to them specifically with Iron Man, everybody\u2019s favorite character. People watch these awesome movies over and over again, not because they depict reality. But because they hold values that are important to us that is exaggerated in the Marvel universe. People dress up as Iron Man all the time. Do these people actually think in the near future they could literally become their favorite Marvel figure? I just personally do not think people really believe that. They might think it could happen in the long future, but not really. The point was that these movies are a fantasy of what could happen in the next centuries and, I repeat do not explain our future hence the word fiction. \n\tMoving on, he adds on to this chapter with a movie with a very realistic approach called Inside Out. This movie was amazing because it took the newest neurological progresses in science and was able to blend that into a good kid friendly movie. I have not watched it myself; I am sure it is a great movie, but this goes on again to what a movie is supposed to achieve. From my perspective movies teach moral lessons that fit the collective conscious in a positive way, which is why many like Marvel movies. Harari thinks movies should be responsible for their realistic approach, but he explains it in not the best way possible. Sure, this movie is very accurate as the representation of the human brain and its emotions, but it is a darn kid\u2019s movie. Do not get me wrong, it is great to have realistic ideas in a movie, but what is a kid going to learn from that movie? Of course, the children will be more understanding of what is happening on a biological level and may continue that practice. But to justify the main idea being that \u201cmovies should be realistic\u201d (Chapter 18) is a great idea coming from bad examples. Not only that, but it does not quite fit with the other chapters. Other chapters were focused on serious current events and their information, and then the science fiction chapter comes out of nowhere. This all reminded me of that one time when the popular game GTA was found by the news, and they ended up sourcing this game to real life crime events like shootings and grand theft auto. I really doubt people who play GTA think they can do that in real life and I see something similar in his statements towards science fiction. \n\tThe overall objective of this book was to inform readers about the current situation they live in and how that plays into their individual scenario. I thought that religion along with many other chapters did and very good job at staying with that idea, while also doing well in educating the audience. However, with the science fiction chapter, I thought that it could be scraped for the information that was given due to an awkward meaning with little evidence and inadequate example choice.",

        "text": "Alayna Krimminger\nSOC 105\n14 Apr 2021\nWhat Part of The Me Do Serial Killers Lack?\nA question that remains unanswered when criminal cases involve scenes of serial killers is why? Why do serial killers feel the need to act on their urges? What part of the personality has so much control that causes the concluding actions of a desire to end in the form of a life being taken? There are three parts to the personality that impact who we are and who we become. First, the social self pertains to the recognition we receive from others (how they see us in their minds). Second, the material self, which by all means is the one part of ourselves that changes least, is responsible for the things we claim and disclaim that all impact who we become. Lastly, the ego, which is responsible for how we see ourselves and is also subject to change the most. A significant driving force impacted by all three of these personality contributions is either a hyperactive nature and nurture influence during early childhood development or the total absence of a nature and nurture influence altogether. Serial killers are motivated by a strong force from the version of \u201cme\" that could be dangerous when not controlled. While all parts of the \"self\" play a role in outward behavior and interaction with others, the version of the self that thrives on stability is the ego. When the ego becomes uncontrollable, so does the individual. \nIn William James' The Self and Its Selves, the concept of self is analyzed. James claims that \"In its widest possible sense, however, a man's self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and words, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account. All of these things give him the same emotion\" (James, 122). In other words, every aspect of our lives plays a role in who we are as people. The daily interactions we unknowingly participate in have an impact on who we are; the slightest bit of change in tone during a conversation can have an unnoticed effect on our subconscious. When the things around us thrive and flourish, so do we. When the things around us crash and burn, so do we, in a way. Who we are can be respectively divided into four categories/sections belonging to two separate groups. The most active part of our personality is responsible for all of our interactions. \t\nThe part of who we are that strictly relies on others to function and is the easily most affected version of ourselves impacted by others, the Social Self. According to William James, the social self is the part of us that seeks validation from others, \"A man's Social Self is the recognition which he gets from his mates\" (James, 123). Social interactions play a vital role in the development of our brains and our emotions. When we are exposed to others at a young age, our brains start to register the \"role\" or \"front\" is used to interact with another person as the Social Self, \"in very early childhood, new procedural memories for interacting with others and for regulating effects can be formed more easily than they can ever be again\" (Tyson, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association).  The lack of healthy interaction at such a young age suggests that children have a reduced development of their sense of agency, their ability to establish moral standards, their ability to assume self-responsibility, and have no capacity for emotional regulation. Many serial killers are victims of rejection at some point in their life. Due to the lack of interaction in early childhood, the rejection is more of a devastation than a simple awkward interaction, \"it may seem to be counterintuitive on the surface, but many serial killers are actually insecure individuals who are compelled to kill due to a morbid\u00a0fear of rejection. In many cases, the fear of rejection seems to result from having been abandoned by their mother in early childhood' (Bonn, Understanding What Drives Serial Killers). James refers to the lack of interaction or being \"unnoticed by all members thereof\" as the most \"fiendish punishment that could be devised.\" Receiving validation from others is essential in developing our ability to understand and return self-expression to others. \n            The material self can pertain to the body, \"the innermost part of the material self in each of us\u2026\" (James, 123). The things we own, such as clothes, also fit into this category because we use clothes to identify and showcase who we are to the outside world. In other words, we express ourselves through the things we call our own. Family applies to this category; the people who raise us, whether it is immediate family or not, become a part of who we are due to their influence on us as children. The role of the family in one's life is critically impacted when it comes to nature vs. nurture. When children are raised on love and affection, their outlook tends to be more positive and joyful. The opposite is in order for when children are raised on hatred and fear; their perspective tends to be more hostile and aggressive. During the infant stage, the sight of aggression in young children is expected due to the lack of self-expression available in their minds. This lack of self-expression results in few ways to attain attention to the issue the infant needs attention for, \"both healthy and pathological aggression involve the intent to harm (in reality or fantasy) and tend to become accompanied with by unpleasant effects such as anger fear or frustration.\" (Fonagy, Aggression and the Psychological Self) From a young age, the lack of love and the integration of aggression leads to the exposure of violence due to the lack of self-expression available in the infant mind, he or she who is exposed to the hatred at such a young age will only grow and develop their own aversion to the ones who appeared to him/her, \"They may come to believe that by destroying the person he desires prior to entering into a relationship with them, he can eliminate the frightening possibility of being abandoned, humiliated or otherwise hurt by someone he loves, as he was in childhood\" (Bonn, Understanding What Drives Serial Killers). Until self-expression can be controlled, violence will continue to be a result of aggression, and it will only become a more driving force in the lives of those affected. \nAs humans continue to develop, the piece responsible for how a person feels about themselves does too. The part of the mind accountable for a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance, \"the ego is the component of personality that is responsible for dealing with reality\" (Cherry, Id, Ego, and Superego Are Part of a Structural Model of Personality). Beginning in the early stages of development, through praise, verbal/nonverbal affirmations, and positive influences, the ego is created for a healthy mental state and positive self-esteem.  These experiences are essential during the early stages of development because it healthily encourages self-love and appreciation. On the other hand, when there is a lack of affirmations and praises, it can have an even more significant impact than receiving the assurances. When children are exposed to feelings such as anger at such a young age, their physical development is impaired, \"In these formulations, aggression is an annihilating presence in the infant. It is an anti-life, anti-self-force; an impediment to the development of the ego, rather than the ego's protest at the presence of impediments in the environment.\" (Fonagy, Aggression and the Psychological Self). In cases where aggression is all a child knows, there is no comprehensible version of positive emotions in their minds. When all the child knows is anger and fear, these emotions gaining strength from being present at a young age can result in the \"wrong idea\" about life in general; this \u201cwrong idea\u201d from childhood results in a bitter and hateful individual. The child that was raised on hatred only grows in rage as they age. \nThe concept in question is why serial killers are the way are they are. The answer to this question may seem complex, but I believe it is simple. Instead of the argument being nature vs. nurture, the concept being challenged should be either too much or not enough nature and nurture will result in a corrupt person, \"It is futile to try to separate developmental influences on children into nature and nurture,\" says\u00a0George Holden, chair of the department of psychology at Southern Methodist University. The \"nature\" part of child development refers to the individual's genetic make-up regarding development and learning. In other words, our nature is how we are predestined to develop and grow up. An example of how nature is responsible is when someone becomes a suspect for murder- a serial killer, their relatives and friends say, \"that's not in his nature,\" referring to the fact that it could not possibly be the person they knew because \"they are not capable\" of that form of evil. Another example can be seen in the bible, \"the sin nature manifested itself early in the genealogy: the very first child born to Adam and Eve, Cain, became the very first murderer\" (Genisis 4:8). The concept of \"nurture\" is the general influence external pressures having on an individual, these influences ranging from family and upbringings to education. However, it has been proven that our genetic predisposition only has a growing impact on how we act. If children grow up in an entirely different environment from their parents, they are more likely to have a more substantial nurture impact. Theodore Wachs, a psychologist at Purdue University who studies child development, quoted, \"if only because the environmental context, broadly conceived, that kids grow up in may be quite different from the environmental context their parents grew up in.\" Too much nature and nurture in a person can lead to dangerous outcomes. Not enough nature and nurture can lead to far more hazardous results; therefore, children must grow and develop a personality on their own terms. \nThe lack of social interaction that is now in effect because of the pandemic we are in is responsible for the growing aggression throughout the world. With this \u201cnew way of life\u201d that is now being traditionalized in many homes, \u201cseriously, given the severity of the coronavirus and how it is impacting us in the form of fear and inconvenience, those things that bothered us before the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December\u2014not even three months ago\u2014don\u2019t seem so bad after all. Coronavirus has put a lot into perspective\u201d (Hyken, The Good Old Days). COVID-19 has removed a large number of components responsible for healthy development. Children born in this pandemic and children in their most prime developmental stage have all been deprived of at least one crucial part of the \u201cme.\u201d  Without a solid contribution from each of the categories, social, material, and ego, children are likely to grow up with a heightened sense of aggression and a deficit of understanding right and wrong. \nSerial killers and ordinary people all share the same components and concepts of the \"Me.\" Each person, no matter their morals, has a social, material, and egotistical self. The differing factor comes into play during the early stages of life. In life, if the \"normal\" individual, love and affection are shown and implemented throughout the span of most their entire life. Beginning in early childhood up to when those responsible for the love and respect no longer exist, these individuals are shown positive reinforcement. Those who are raised on aggression and hatred follow a very different path of life. When all this individual is able to process is hatred and aggression, their ability to express compassion and love has now been rerouted to resulting in violence to express their desires. While the component of self is consistent from person to person, the development of these components in each individual varies extensively. Each variation of these features comes with its own identity; as James William would say, \"the personal identity would not exist as a fact: but it would exist as a feeling all the same.\" Personal identity is not just the identity of the person; it is the environment around the person; it is their family or lack thereof, it is their interactions at a young age, it is the emotions they were exposed to as children. The material is self is what we are made of. The social self is who others say we are, and the ego self is who we say we are. When these three components are aligned, the future seems bright, but there is no way to predict the damage when these three components are not aligned. \n\n\nWorks Cited\nBonn, Scott.\u00a0Understanding What Drives Serial Killers. 15 Sept 2019, www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wicked-deeds/201909/understanding-what-drives-serial-killers\nCherry, Kendra. \"Id, Ego, and Superego Are Part of a Structural Model of Personality.\"\u00a0Verywell Mind, www.verywellmind.com/the-id-ego-and-superego-2795951\nGotQuestions.org. \"What Is the Sin Nature?\"\u00a0GotQuestions.org, 31 Jan 2015, www.gotquestions.org/sin-nature.html\nGuy, Fiona.\u00a0The Criminal Profile in Crime Psychology. 7 Jul 2018, www.crimetraveller.org/2015/09/criminal-profile/\nFonagy, Peter, George S.

        "text": "Alayna Krimminger\nSOC 105\n1 Apr 2021\nThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representations vs.\n Chapter 6: Civilization \u201cOne Dollar to Rule Them All\u201d\nThe two readings I am going to compare are Emile Durkheim\u2019s The Cultural Logic of Collective Representations and Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s One Dollar to Rule Them All. I believe these two reading both reflect the meaning of a collective consciousness by both mentioning religion as a common similarity among cultures and both also mentioning how humans view the natural world through indifferences with science. Collective consciousness and collective representation are both found in social institutions which is why they are responsible for the rituals we see in our everyday lives. Not only do these two concepts allow societies to function as one unit, but it is also these two products of society that allow people to have a sense of belonging. \nEmile Durkheim strived to explain why certain values, traditions, and beliefs remain the same through an entire community. His theory is that religion is responsible for the idea of a collective consciousness. \u201cThe formation of the ideal world is therefore not an irreducible fact which escapes science: it depends upon conditions which observation can touch; it is a natural product of social life,\u201d (p.73) The conditions of which that are shared are created from a group of people using the same daily traditions. A collective conscious was created by individuals who wanted to achieve a community. By holding certain values and traditions at a high standard among everyone in the community, the ability to achieve a common goal is more successful. This is further explained by Harari in his \u201cOne Dollar to Rule Them All\u201d. \nI was able to connect this to Harari because he was able to portray the same thought process of Durkheim through his description of similarities between the views shared by humans, \u201cYet the homogeneity of contemporary humanity is most apparent when it comes to our view of the natural world and of the human body,\u201d (p.113). Like Durkheim, Harari continues to further analyze how humans are not so different after all when describing more realistic values instead of beliefs and traditions, Harari goes as far as comparing how the process of government is similar also, \u201cBut when it comes to the practical stuff\u2014how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a bomb\u2014almost all of us belong to the same civilization,\u201d (p.115). These two reading share one main topic and that is how similar we as humans really are, from the moment we are born to the moment we die, the societies we are placed in allow us to learn and generate traditions, values, and beliefs to the overall \u201cwhole\u201d of society.

        "text": "850625507\nSOC 105\n01 May 2024\nCommodity Fetishism vs. McDonaldization\nIn sociology, two known concepts, commodity fetishism and McDonaldization, offer interesting perspectives on modern society.  While both ideas deal with characteristics of modern capitalism and its impact on society, they do so from different perspectives, focusing opposite tendencies in the trade of things and the rationalization of social processes. A comparison review of these ideas and a real-world scenario allows us to better comprehend their consequences and judge how effective they are in explaining current events.\nCommodity Fetishism: According to Karl Marx's ideas, commodity fetishism is the social trends in which goods have meaning in addition to their physical worth. Goods carry social meanings and wants in capitalist countries in addition to being useful items. This obsession hides the social context of production, making people mistakenly believe that goods possess magical qualities instead of being the result of labor produced by humans.. \nMcDonaldization: George Ritzer, a sociologist, developed the term \"McDonaldization\" to refer to the process of simplifying and reducing procedures, especially in relation to fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's. It means using effective and controllable methods to a range of areas of life, including food service, healthcare, and education. McDonaldization is a symbol of the success of efficiency and reason over feeling in modern social structures.\nComparisons: While both ideas develop in the context of capitalism, they differ in their focus and level.  Commodity fetishism is concerned primarily with the meaning associated with things, emphasizing the creation of value in consumer society. In contrast, McDonaldization focuses on process simplification and standards, emphasizing experience equality and the development of efficiency-oriented systems.\nContrasts: One key distinction between the two concepts lies in their treatment of agency. Commodity fetishism underscores the agency of consumers in attributing value to commodities through their consumption choices and cultural practices. On the other hand, McDonaldization emphasizes the role of institutional structures in shaping social processes, often leading to the disenchantment and standardization of everyday life.\nReal-World Scenario: Consider the rise of coffee culture in the 21st century.  Coffee, originally considered a simple beverage, has grown into a symbol of status, personality, and lifestyle for many people. The growth of specific coffee shops, each with their own blends, brewing processes, and atmosphere, shows commodity fetishism. Coffee is no longer viewed just as a caffeine source, but rather as an experience to be enjoyed, shared on social media, and connected with specific identities.\nSimultaneously, the coffee sector has become McDonaldized, particularly with the rise of global coffee franchises such as Starbucks. These businesses simplify the coffee-drinking experience with the same menus, store layouts, and service processes around the world. Starbucks' efficiency-driven approach, which focuses on speed, consistency, and convenience, illustrates  simplified structure.\nDespite its flaws, commodity fetishism and McDonaldization continue to be popular concepts for understanding modern society's complexities. Commodity fetishism raises questions about the social creation of value, as well as how consumer culture impacts identities and relationships. Recognizing the symbolic elements of goods allows us to better understand how people interact with their social environment through buying habits.\nMcDonaldization, focuses on reason and standard of social processes, highlighting the broad impact of things being simplified in modern organizations. While McDonaldization might ignore the wide range of human experiences, it provides important insights into the techniques used by modern capitalism to streamline our daily lives. By combining these viewpoints and analyzing with their effects, we could create deeper views of capitalism's difficult relationship with culture and social organization in the twenty-first century.\nBoth commodity fetishism and McDonaldization offer valuable insights into contemporary society, yet they have their limitations. Commodity fetishism effectively highlights the cultural and symbolic dimensions of consumption, shedding light on how commodities become repositories of social meaning. However, it may overlook structural inequalities in the production and distribution of goods, focusing primarily on consumer behaviors and cultural practices.\nSimilarly, McDonaldization provides a compelling framework for understanding the rationalization of modern institutions and the proliferation of efficiency-driven systems. Yet, it tends to oversimplify complex social phenomena, reducing them to calculable and predictable processes. Moreover, McDonaldization overlooks the diversity of human experiences and the potential for resistance against rationalized systems.\nIn conclusion, while commodity fetishism and McDonaldization offer valuable perspectives on the dynamics of modern capitalism, they should be viewed as complementary rather than competing theories. A nuanced understanding of contemporary society requires integrating insights from both concepts, recognizing the interplay between symbolic meanings and institutional structures in shaping social life. By critically evaluating these concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios, we can deepen our understanding of the complexities of consumer culture and societal organization in the 21st century.\n",

        "text": "Alayna Krimminger\nSOC 105\n08 Mar 2021\nEssay 7:\nMax Weber\u2019s The Spirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage and Karl Marx\u2019s Estranged Labor provide a thorough analysis of how capitalism came to be. In Weber\u2019s piece we see how this contribution to capitalism can be linked back to religion specifically under the Protestant branch. Under the Protestant religion, a group of people called Calvinists believed that their fate was predetermined by whether or not they would go to heaven or hell after their death. Due to this belief, it was believed that if one was already saved, the monetary benefits and material success would reap throughout their lives as God\u2019s way of showing who had been saved. Seeking profit was seen as virtuous because if you had been saved, God would provide you with the means to become wealthy. However, in Marx\u2019s piece, we see the downside of capitalism in the working class. The working class has slowly become estranged from the work because they are not reaping the benefits and are now \u201cabandoning\u201d their work because they are not able to keep the profit they are creating. This environment between the workers and the property owners becomes hostile because they are not working to earn, they are working to distribute. Just like in Weber\u2019s The Spirit of Capitalism, when profit was earned, workers believed they had been saved because of \u201cGods will\u201d they are able to succeed therefore they were motivated to work. In Marx\u2019s Estranged Labor, the workers feel alienated from their work because they are not succeeding, they are working for someone else and not achieving any personal gain.\nSomething I see in modern life to illustrate these arguments is college\u2026 The connection I made to Marx\u2019s piece is many students do schoolwork 4-6 days a week and still receive low grades and harsh comments from professors even though they did the work. They are not seeing any benefit but instead a depletion in moral therefore becoming estranged from the work. Although, without doing the work in college (which collectively will benefit the economy with students that are ready to work) students will not be able to benefit the \u201cwhole\u201d which is the economy by being able to go out and work. The connection that I can also make to college using Weber\u2019s argument is the opposite of the argument I made for Marx\u2019s. When students work 4-6 days a week and receive positive feedback and, in some cases, even praise for their work, students have a high moral and a replenished sense of confidence because they were praised by their \u201chigher up\u201d. Good work is rewarded with good feedback and I can speak personally for this effect, motivation peeks because of that lingering feeling of \u201cprofit\u201d and the profit being a good grade and personal achievement. \n\tMy personal experience to illustrate this is very current. Earlier this semester I got feedback on a history essay that I worked on for 9 days. I worked so hard on this essay, day and night, I spent hours researching and find sources and going through my notes to ensure that I had references and evidence to support my claims. I felt so confident on this paper\u2026 I got the grade back and my professor literally failed my paper and suggested that I see someone at the writing center. Safe to say my morale was on the floor and was not going to be picked up anytime soon. I felt defeated and out of spite I didn\u2019t attend my class for two weeks. It wasn\u2019t until my professor reached out with concern that I attended the class again but the question that I can connect to Marx\u2019s argument is \u2018why should I attend the class when I was attending the class and asking for help on my assignments just to be failed and told to seek help on my writing?\u201d Like the workers began to question why they should do the work if they were not going to be commissioned.  Now onto the more positive side of Weber\u2019s argument, an example I have is also for this semester. I am very passionate about English because I want to pursue a career in writing/journalism (hence why I was so butthurt about my History Professors comment). On the first assignment I completed for my English class this semester, my professor reached out and asked if I was comfortable with her using my work as an example for her to show to the class and others in the English department. I felt starstruck because something I had done had been recognized, this can be connected by the benefits reaped in the Calvinists religion for being chosen by God and the benefits that were seen monetarily in the lives of those who had been \u201csaved\u201d. \n\tThe two arguments this week analyze the origin and understanding of capitalism through a positive and negative viewpoint. Capitalism can be referred to through many different lenses of how it is received or how it is not received. Those who see physical commission are more likely to strive for even more commission because their hard work is being seen. Those who do not see the physical recognition are less likely to strive for more because their work is not be accepted or commissioned. Capitalism is perceived differently by the different individuals in how they are being recognized for the work they are doing from the person \u201cin charge\u201d or overseeing them.\n\n",

        "text": "SOC 105\nOctober 16, 2021\nKorean Standards\n\t\nIn my time in this class, we have talked about many cool concepts ranging from what a persons\u2019 character is made up of to how evolution caused the human race to become more advanced. But the one concept that was most relevant to me was the one about the collective conscious and how that plays a role in society. The society I am interested in is the society where I come from, which is Korean. I remember enjoying many things from Korean society, but I wanted to focus on K-pop because artists in that profession face many societal issues that will help understand Korean society and how toxic it can be.\n\tI remember enjoying listening to K-pop when I was younger. There was this group at the time called BIGBANG that was making these huge hits that I loved. My family had this projector in our basement that I would always go down to watch BIGBANG with their flashy outfits and upbeat music. So, most K-pop groups have choreographed dances to go with the song, which was why it was so exciting to see a new song from that group. And I would turn on my favorite song, MONSTER and try to learn the dance in secret because I had so much fun doing so. But in 2015, the group had disbanded for some odd reason, and I always wondered what happened to them. Up until now, I saw online that the group members had been caught smoking weed and now their whole label, YG who also owns other K-pop groups is hated by the public from one mistake. \nBasically, in Korea, smoking weed or doing any recreational drug is considered taboo and they ended up getting ten months because of it. Not only that, but the fanbase ended up turning on the group members by throwing horrible comments at them and it was bad enough to where one of the members attempted suicide. I thought the whole situation was very unforgiving along with being completely undeserved knowing how much fans loved the group before this incident and how they simply threw them away. To make things even worse, because of the war, men in South Korea are required to be in the army at least once in their lifetime. This meant that members of BIGBANG, including the one that attempted suicide are now unable to make music and need to serve their country. The whole situation is very unpleasant, but this drove me to find out why this was happening to them and hopefully try to explain it utilizing what was learned from sociology.\n\tKorean culture can be viewed as toxic mainly because of how their society is based too much off the collective conscious. Going on with K-pop, if a specific idol, or member of a group does not meet a specific beauty standard. They are usually shamed with a sense of worthlessness for not appealing to the collective consciousness. A quick google search brought me to a site of K-pop idols who essentially \u201cdefy\u201d Korean beauty standards and how they are treated by fans. I slowly realized that what happened to BIGBANG is not necessarily new and that other groups are often narrowly criticized for even smaller things. I want to emphasize the word toxic in my introduction to describe their society because these performers that are thought to be \u201cugly\u201d are often ridiculed from mean comments on their videos to straight up death threats for something that artist cannot change. To anyone, it sounds disgusting to call out an artist who makes music to also expect these performers to be models and on top of that, know how to dance well. I think what is expected of these idols is extremely absurd and the Korean fanbase needs to tone it down at least a notch. \nWhat I think is happening is that the collective conscious for Korea is very opinion-based and less individual compared to American values. It feels like the Korean collective conscious tells people to become absolute perfection and has little regard for that person\u2019s quality of life if they are not meeting specific ideals. A slight slip up on what a person\u2019s actions and that person is now deemed \u201cunworthy\u201d and that is a lot of what I am seeing. Going back to that perfectionism, it seems there is a big sense of worthlessness to an individual if they are not a hundred percent and that is shown with all the criticism these entertainers receive. I think this really demonstrates how powerful the collective conscious can be on a society. It is hard to receive good feedback from people in general and even more difficult from a tough crowd that has outrageous expectations. What I am saying is that these performers have little say into a society that has these certain values making it very tough for diversity to occur. It makes sense because a lot of Korean music sounds similar to each other and does not have many genres compared to American music. Most of K-pop consists of usually a group of three to twelve that pretty much produces only mainstream pop music, which proves my point. \n\t Another thing that adds on to the toxicity, is the Korean beauty standard. It is a superficial aspect of their society that is based off that unrealistic perfection that was mentioned before. I felt this needed to be added was because of these absurd requirements that idols are criticized more often than they should. To put it briefly, for women, it is preferred they have a small face, big unproportioned eyes, and a very slim body with a particular weight of about a hundred-and-ten. And for men, they need smooth skin, good hair, have double eyelids, and appear androgyne. Both genders face difficulty and it causes that lack of individuality in their society when fixed attributes are preferred. From an American standpoint, this can seem unachievable because women have to be very thin no matter their height, and men are required to be a little more feminine-sided, which sounds like the opposite from how we see it. It is just very different from our society. On top of that, most Americans would not opt for plastic surgery as it can be extremely expensive and seen as something not needed. A bigger problem with their beauty standards is how far some people are willing to fit into the Korean collective consciousness with the help of plastic surgery. South Korea has the highest rate of plastic surgeries in the world and is also the best at it. Apparently, some estimates suggest that every one in three women in Korea get some sort of surgery, while some say at least fifty percent. Their most popular surgeries are the blepharoplasty, or double-eyelid surgery, rhinoplasties, or nose jobs, and glutathione injections, which slows pigmentation in the skin, giving a brighter tone. expensive and can come with negative side effects. \n\tHow does that tie in with Korean society? The whole beauty standard appears to be the root of the problem where people feel pressure to apply themselves to these characteristics. With the example of plastic surgery, clearly Korean women desire to look more beautiful as at least one in three opt to pay for facial surgery. Again, the collective conscious demonstrates how important people\u2019s opinions are to the Korean individual and how surgery can completely change a viewpoint on a person solely based on their attractiveness. By doing so, an individual could possibly have higher social status among peers, get complimented more often, and most importantly, be part of the collective that everyone in that society thinks are positive. Once these social responses are discovered by the individual, it probably leads to a much happier and more welcoming lifestyle if many people accept these looks. On the contrary, say if you do not meet these requirements, then people will probably have some type of prejudice towards that person and perhaps even look down upon them. This is why I describe this society as toxic because not everyone is going to achieve these standards, which attributes to one of the reasons why Korea is one of the top ten countries for suicide. \nAfter everything, how does sociology explain Korean society in how it can be characterized as toxic? I believe that the sociology concept of the collective conscious described by Durkheim allows us to dive deeper into the problem. It helps explain the tragedy of the group BIGBANG and how this scenario is not specific to this group, but a bigger problem of Korean standards along with beauty. ",

        "text": "SOC 105\n2 May 2022\nModern-day Effects of The Beauty Myth\n\tSocietal pressures and unrealistic beauty standards take a toll on women\u2019s lives from the day that they are born. We have watched the beauty standards shift and change throughout time for centuries, but the one thing that never changes is the feelings women go through every day as they strive to live up to those impossible standards. The invention of cell phones and social media has turned beauty standards into a whole different kind of monster. The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf is a book about how beauty standards came to be and how they have been perpetuated over time. The beauty myth is a concept that says women become obsessed with their physical appearance and how they are perceived. This myth says that the only way you can matter or be a woman of substance in any way is to be beautiful in the eyes of society and it is what causes so many women to develop eating disorders and many other damaging daily habits. \n\tI was born in 2003 and I was able to see how social media morphed into what it is now, in 2022. Everything that I can remember from when I was young includes some sort of technology or social media surrounding me. I remember being in elementary school and feeling so stressed and upset because I looked different from the popular girls. I can guarantee you that every woman can remember a specific age or time period in their childhood where things changed. They most likely started with comparing themselves to other girls at school and things like that or wanting to act or look different to impress boys. As women get older it only gets worse and worse because you know and have more things to worry about that include the beauty standards that only increase as you become a teenager or adult. \n\tThere are many things that the beauty myth entails but one obvious example is that women\u2019s value is based off their appearance. In turn when men are able to say that they have a beautiful woman they are seen as successful. Society has always told women from an extremely young age that their life goal should be finding a man to love them and to remain beautiful. Women are constantly striving to catch up to the unrealistic beauty standards of our society, but when they finally reach those standards, if they even do, the standards have shifted or changed. This cycle is what Naomi Wolf dissects and explains throughout her book. \nWomen and girls have the idea that beauty and looks should be the most important thing engrained into them from birth. In my personal experience social media has dramatically increased the amount of influence that young girls and women feel to look and be a certain way. Influencers and celebrities are the people that everyone looks up to and people strive to be like them. But when these people are perpetuating fake looks weather it is plastic surgery or simply editing their photos, it becomes a huge issue. If regular women and girls just like me grow up being taught and shown that women are supposed to look like that, they will constantly be striving for an appearance that is utterly impossible. \nAlmost every one of my female friends and even some males have said they deal with some sort of eating disorder or body dysmorphia. Body dysmorphia is a serious condition that so many people have without even realizing it. People with body dysmorphia see themselves completely different than they really look. It is usually displayed by people viewing themselves as weighing a lot more than that really do. But it can also come across as seeing your face in a completely different way than others do. When people become so hyper fixated on the way they look you cannot blame them for blurring the lines. Unrealistic beauty standards support and perpetuate this hyper fixation on being the skinniest and the prettiest that you can be according to what that looks like to society at the time being. \n\tAnother way that the beauty myth has affected modern day beauty standards is by perpetuating the idea that women should always submit to the eyes of the male gaze. Acting and looking appealing for the male gaze is something that so many girls experience from such a young age because it is what they are taught. I can remember how girls as young as elementary school age used to change themselves completely, weather it was their personality or looks all for a boy. This kind of ideology follows women as they get older. When women dress for the male gaze it is often come across as being more revealing clothes. But as we get older men only seem to desire women with less and less clothes. But when women follow this standard of less and less clothes and they for example say no to a man, they are showered with hateful words and in some cases even violence. Women are told that they were asking for it after they have been assaulted because what they were wearing was \u201ctoo revealing\u201d. But if the woman was wearing more clothes they would be seen as undesirable and a prude. There are so many other examples and ways that you could go with this analogy, and you can obviously see that it is a horrible cycle of confusion and hurt for women. \n\tThe beauty myth has affected modern day society in many ways including perpetuating things like unrealistic beauty standards, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and many others. The beauty myth is the idea that women should live for their looks and that their value is based on how well they fit into the perfect standard of beauty that society has in mind at that moment. It is obvious that it is completely impossible for women to keep up with all of these things, because they are changing every single day. It is so harmful to young girls and women to focus on and base their worth on how society perceives them. Social media influencers and celebrities have brought so much more negativity and even more unrealistic standards into women\u2019s lives. Young girls and women are fed these images of fake beauty and told that they should try their best to be just like them. Women are also told that their purpose in life should be to find a man willing to love them and if they cannot they should do everything they can to appeal better to men. We are told that is it our fault if men do not want us or even if they do want us, but we say no. Men are told they can take what they want from women no matter what the women have to say about it and women are often blamed because of things like the way that they looked when it happened. Overall, the unrealistic beauty standards that girls and women face every day have been out of control for long enough and they are only getting more out of control. Something needs to be done because the beauty myth has taken such a toll on women for so long. As I said before it is so detrimental to women\u2019s both physical and mental health. There is no reason why women should base their own value and worth on the way that they look alone. We need to change the way that everyone sees beauty as a whole society. \n\t\n",

        "text": "Rees Kelso\nSoc 105\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nEquality\n\n\tThroughout time and as we develop our economy and as a society more and more as years go by, we have always faced an issue of inequality, specifically when it comes to issues that Harari mentions throughout 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, such as issues between the way the economy has been set up and the divide that it has caused throughout the socioeconomic classes that we have. Another issue Harari discusses that is causing inequality against the people through the internet and larger corporations. \n\nAs we are constantly electing new candidates into a seat in office, the divide between our socioeconomic classes is growing further and further apart from each other. The idea of a middle class is slowly fading away due to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. As Harari puts it, \u201c Some groups increasingly monopolize the fruits of globalization, while billions are left behind.\u201d This is caused by the rich employing and paying very little to the hard labor workers so while they are stuck in the bottom class, the rich corporation owners are making millions off of the underpaid laborers.\n\n\tAnother economic issue that we are facing that is causing inequality in the United States, and throughout the rest of the world is the problem between the privacy of consumers and corporations. Large corporations are taking private personal information from their consumers and using that information to be sold to other companies, specifically for marketing purposes. The problem with this is that companies preach that they are there for the people and that all of your information is safe with them. Have you ever noticed how you will look something up or be interested in buying something, and then shortly after you see advertisements and posts geared towards the product you are interested in? This is because of those companies selling your personal data and search history to other countries. \n\nHarari discusses this with the example of Mark Zuckerburg when it comes to Facebook. He talks about how Mar Zuckerburg was focusing on using the information from people\u2019s accounts and putting them into groups through Facebook based on their common interests. Although some people might like this, Facebook is still using the information you are putting into the private parts of your account and sending it out and grouping you with other people. What does not help this cause is that Zuckerburg and the Facebook brand already have a lack of trust from society due to information being stored in Facebook getting accessed by third-party companies to then manipulate elections.  The other problem with this situation is that like Hariri states in 21 lessons for the 21st century, that we should not be using this form of technology to fix the issues that this country and world are facing socially. \n\n\t\nAs stated before, one main issue that causes a divide and inequality throughout the country and the rest of the world is the large class divide between the upper and lower classes. Harari says in his book how the top 1% own half of the world's entire wealth. He also shows how large this divide is by stating that the top 100 richest people combined have more money than four billion people of the entire population. \n\nMarx had a similar look towards this issue as Harari when it comes to how capitalism is affecting the divide between the classes. Marx describes that the worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth that he gains, and the more his production increases in power and range. He discusses how the product of labor is labor which is congealed in an object making it become a material. He also discusses that with the conditions dealt with by political economy and this realization of labor appears as a loss of reality for the workers. Basically stating how the lower class works these very intense, high-demanding labor jobs for countless amounts of hours making the minimum amount. When he talks about the worker becoming poorer the more wealth that he gains he is talking about that divide because the more wealth and product being produced is all going towards the higher-ups in the company, allowing them to make a large amount of profit off of the underpaid laborers.\n\n\nBoth Marx and Harari are on the same page when it comes to their thoughts on the class divide due to the corrupt system we have between the corporations and laborers due to the capitalistic economy that we have established in the United States. It is almost like a never-ending cycle that is very unlikely for you to escape from due to the rarity in moving up classes. Most people will end up making a similar amount to their parents due to if the parents were in a lower social class, some might not be able to afford that college education for their children, making it a lot harder for them to escape the cycle that their parents have established for them.\n\nOverall, there is a big issue that we face throughout the world when it comes to inequality particularly between the economy that we have established and the power that has been given to corporations and large company owners. Whether it is because of them making profits off of hard-working under paid laborers, or selling private information given to them by their consumers, it is causing a widespread issue between people and socioeconomic status. The other issue that we have due to these corporations is that it establishes almost a sandtrap for generations to come because you get stuck in a cycle of underpaid hard-working jobs due to the inability to afford your way into an upper-class. \n\n\n\n\t",

        "text": "SOC 105\nApril 2, 2024\nThe Erosion of the Human Experience: Estranged Labor and McDonaldization\n\tThe innate nature of human beings has always been a prevalent topic discussed among sociologists for centuries with many focusing on the idea of how our environment itself may shape our relationships. Among these sociologists some believe that human beings are inherently social creatures with the capability of expressing cooperation and collective action, yet this is not something commonly seen within today's society. One man who researched this disconnect between our nature and our actions was Karl Marx with his famous writings on \u201cestranged labor.\u201d Much later in time another sociologist by the name of George Ritzer focused on a similar topic, named McDonaldization, which is more in tune with modern occurrences and examples. Although these separate ideas were built nearly a century apart, both McDonaldization and estranged labor come together in order to highlight the dehumanizing effects of capitalist production as well as the loss of autonomy that comes with it.\n\tAccording to Karl Marx, human beings are incredibly unique creatures due to their capacity to interact and produce labor both creatively and socially. He argues that this production of labor is exactly what helped individuals develop their identities and later shape society. However, Marx states that in capitalist societies, workers become disconnected from the products of their labor, from the process of labor itself, and from their own humanity. This separation is referred to as \u201cestranged labor\u201d or \u201calienated labor.\u201d This estrangement occurs because workers do not have control over what they produce, how they produce it, or the conditions under which they work. Instead, they are often reduced to mere cogs in a machine, performing repetitive tasks without any sense of fulfillment or connection to their work. Overall, work under capitalism subverts Marx\u2019s view on human nature because it alienates individuals from each other which enforces a rigid division of labor with the entire process undermining the intrinsic satisfaction of work and limits individual potential.\n\tRitzer's idea of \"McDonaldization\" builds on Marx's concept of alienation but applies it specifically to the context of fast-food restaurants, particularly McDonald's. McDonaldization refers to the process by which principles of fast food, such as efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control are prioritized through automation. However, Ritzer also argues that these key aspects of McDonaldization are increasingly dominating various aspects of society beyond the realm of food service and beginning to seep into other foundations such as retail chains, education facilities, and even social media. This growing concept is referred to as rationalization which describes the transformation of social and economic life from traditional and value driven systems to those based on efficiency, calculation, and control. \t\nThe connection between Marx's concept of estranged labor and Ritzer's theory of McDonaldization is rooted in their shared emphasis on the dehumanizing consequences within the capitalist system of production and consumption. Both feature individuals, whether as workers or consumers, being stripped of their intrinsic humanity and reduced to mere components within a larger mechanized apparatus. Instead, they become mere instruments in the pursuit of profit, engaged in repetitive tasks that divorce them from any genuine connection to the products they create or the process of labor itself. Similarly, Ritzer's idea of McDonaldization extends this dehumanization to the realm of consumption, particularly within the fast-food industry but also across broader domains. The overall focus on efficiency underlines the systematic detraction of agency as well as the commodification of human existence.\nIn conclusion, while theories have varied, one consistent theme on the evolution of human nature is the tension between the potential for cooperation inherent in human beings and the realities of societal structures that often inhibit such tendencies. Karl Marx's concept of estranged labor sheds light on how capitalist modes of production alienate individuals from the fruits of their labor, leading to a loss of autonomy and a sense of disconnection from their work and fellow human beings. This notion, rooted in Marx's analysis of capitalism, resonates with George Ritzer's theory of McDonaldization, which highlights how the principles of efficiency and predictability in fast-food culture have permeated various aspects of contemporary society, further eroding human agency and individuality.\n\n",

        "text": "7611\nSOC 105\n1 February, 2023\nTitle\n\tWhat constitutes the \u201cself\u201d within a person\u2019s stream of consciousness has always been a debated topic among Sociologists for centuries. Some believe that the \u201cself\u201d is merely a way for the body to capture experiences and is merely constructed from two separate ideas. Others share the belief that the \u201cself\u201d is a part of something much greater and can be divided into several  different parts which each specialize in one of three categories. Among these sociologists are William James and George Herbert Mead who both spent much of their lives organizing their views on the topic and although they have a fair amount of differences, their ideas on the self are still quite comparable. This comparison can be shown through Mead\u2019s concept of experience and Jame\u2019s concept of the \u201csocial self.\u201d\n\tGeorge Herbert Mead is among the sociologists who define the self as working in balance with the body in a construct known as \u201cmind-body duality.\u201d This idea revolves around experiences and the way that an individual experience is interpreted and taken in by both the body and mind separately. An experience of the body is considered to be done directly because when the body is exposed to a stimulus it is able to directly capture the experience. An experience of the mind/self is considered to be done indirectly because when the self is exposed to a stimulus it is only able to experience it through the body, however, the self is able to reflect on the overall experience and think about it later. So although the body is able to feel things directly, the experience is incomplete and even though the mind is able to experience a stimulus completely, it is done indirectly through the body. This idea of the self displays Mead\u2019s concept in how the self is merely an extension of the mind that helps us reflect on our outside environments in a more complete manner so that we can learn and grow from our experiences.\n\tWilliam James believed that the self is such a complicated construct that it must be divided into three separate parts: the material self, the social self, and the spiritual self. His rationale for this idea is that a human being can have so many materialistic and interpersonal connections throughout their life that it becomes hard to distinguish themselves from what they own. In summary the material self refers to a person\u2019s property and body, the social self refers to how they are perceived and accepted by others, and the spiritual self is their emotions and inner thoughts. Although the material self and emotional self are both essential parts of James\u2019 overall construct, the social self is the most relevant in terms of comparison to Mead\u2019s ideas. In general the social self can be seen best through the differing personalities one expresses based on the environment they are in or who they are currently around. For example if someone is with a trusted partner or friend they know intimately then they will tend to be a bit more vulnerable and open. However, if they are among strangers they may be less open and therefore perceived as standoffish and quiet. Both examples showcase instances of the social self as well as how it is easily influenced and changed based on a stimulus or environment.\n\tAlthough Mead\u2019s and James\u2019 opinions and explanations of the self differ greatly in definition and example I believe that their concepts are still comparable and coexist. This comparison can be displayed through Mead\u2019s overall concept of experience through the mind and James\u2019 concept of the \u201csocial self.\u201d In Mead\u2019s article The Self The I and The Me he states that \u201cWhat determines the amount of the self that gets into communication is the social experience itself.\u201d What Mead is trying to express in this quote is that the way we express ourselves based on our previous experiences and that whether we allow ourselves to come through fully or not depends on how comfortable we are at a given time/conversation. This concept is extremely comparable to James\u2019 specific connotation of the \u201csocial self\u201d with both ideas referring to how we express ourselves and are perceived by others based on experiences.  \u201cThe amount of the self that gets into conversation\u2026\u201d can be viewed as the differing degrees of personality we express at any given time based on the conversation and comfortability.\n\tSo even though James and Mead have very differing definitions of the self and how it can be divided, both sociologists believe that the social aspects of the self can be influenced and displayed differently based on our interactions and experience. Mead states that our environment determines the amount of the self we express while James argues this expression is merely a third of the overall construct. Either way these similarities in ideas shows that although the two sociologists have differing ideas on the self, their concepts can still go along with and support the other if analyzed properly.",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n18 October, 2021\n\nHow Technology Controls the Collective Consciousness of Gen Z Today\n\n   What seems to be the general consensus among people above the age of at least forty-five everywhere is that \u201cKids spend too much time on their phones. Everything that goes wrong is the doing of this new-fangled technology.\u201d When discussing the collective consciousness of today, the inclusion and analysis of social media, the Internet, and technology must be included. If enough people come together to share a piece of land, and breathe the same air, as well as all following similar or the same rules, beliefs, and ideas, that counts as a society. Hence, the collective consciousness of one people. Social Media has done this to Gen Z by the rise of technology, and luckily we are breaking cycles through the use of Social Media as an advantage to our Collective Consciousness. \n    The acronym I.D.E.A by Nathaniel Turner from TED x Hobart High School can help us understand. Impatient. We have the ocean of the world at our fingertips, any information in the world in less than 0.5 milliseconds. We are \u201cAddicts of instant gratification.\u201d\nDistracted by all the things we feel that we have to do because no one else will. Global Warming, Race and Gender discrimination, no job or home security. Where does one even start?\nEntitled to our inalienable rights as people, the self evident truths given to us by the declaration of independence, which many older generations seem to think we don\u2019t deserve. \nApathetic because of our lack of education on physical and mental health, as well as the rise in anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues and disabilities. Anxiety is on the rise, because of our levels of dopamine being triggered by likes and follows constantly. This generation began to rely on a consistent stream of posts, videos, likes, followers, and any other kind of digital and social media.  \n        As the most suicidal generation in history we joke about EVERYTHING. School shootings, depression, and death. In our generation, depression has also been romanticized. Shows like 13 Reasons Why unfortunately, are a big contributor to that. A lot of the music that is produced now can be found discussing depression, the daily school shootings in our classrooms, the suicidal thoughts and feelings of a whole entire generation. Jon Bellion\u2019s \u201cMorning in America\u201d for example, discusses how the expectations of parents are too heavy, and we try to keep up with all the \u201cgreat expectations, so I keep on faking. We\u2019re secretly out of control, and everyone knows.\u201d But, no one, at least not the parents, teachers, or counselors tend to do anything about it. The term \u201cdepression\u201d is used very loosely, and that results in dangerous thoughts and ideas for this generation. We maladaptive daydream, and question the government and take things into our own hands. Around more than half our life, we have not been seen or treated as our own human beings by the adults around us. Parents, teachers, the older people around us often refuse to see things  the way that Generation Z does.\n\n      It\u2019s all about connections.  As Gary Vee, a popular TikToker and Inspirational Speaker says, \u201cYou may not like the way they\u2019re communicating, but they\u2019re more social than we\u2019ve ever seen them.\u201d The tools we have access to, allow us to make these issues mainstream and bring much more awareness. Those who did not grow up with the same experience however, cannot understand and place the blame on the thing they despise, rather than looking at their own actions. Technology is now just a huge plethora of opinions and beliefs and because you don\u2019t need to be a published author to share your ideas anymore the media\u2018s role as the gatekeeper of truth is gone. Anyone can share anything on the Internet regardless of its accuracy or truthfulness. Lies in fact do have a tendency to spread faster than truth does especially on the Internet. False claims are over 70% more likely to be shared on Twitter than true claims. Over 2/3 of adults receive at least part of their news on social media and of the demographic under half specified Facebook as a \u201creliable\u201d source. Known as Confirmation Bias, it elicits tendencies of users to select information adhering to their own system of beliefs, using an algorithm of the user instead of stating proof and facts. The groups of like minded people whose view is already polarized because the only information they know is that which proves are already conceived notions. The revolution of social media has both helped and destroyed our way of social activity in different ways. Being the most obese country in the world could partially be due to the fact that most people would prefer to stay inside on their devices instead of get out and move around. \n\n    Bo Burnham said it best when he said that it was \u201ca bad idea to allow giant media corporations to exploit the neuro-chemical drama of children in America.\u201d (Bo Burnham, Inside Netflix)\nEver since middle school for most kids my age, and even now from the age of two years old, technology is the only thing that exists and is constant around us nowadays. When sharing everything online, every little detail of life, what you choose to show and what you choose not to show to the world all affects the emotional and mental space in people's minds today. it takes form in movements, trends, and even fashion. From the Black Lives Matter movement, to the Backyardigans trend on Tik Tok, even to what kinds of jeans and shoes are popular. The proof of the collective consciousness comes from this constant peer pressure.\n\n       And then there is time to bring in moral absolutes, thoughts and ideas, and the decision of who will be in power. Typically in the past everything has been controlled by Old, White, Cisgendered men. Nowadays though, the younger generations are beginning to question that authority, as they are right to do so. With the mixed ideas of race, gender, and much any quality not only in the workplace but also throughout life, whether it be in a grocery store, dealing with the law and the police, or even just places like restaurants or the service industry, people are no longer seeing people that are differently than them as people. For example, my father tends to look down on employees who work at restaurants such as McDonald\u2019s or Taco Bell. He has always accused me of becoming like one of those types of people. This past weekend during fall break I brought it up to him that he seems to treat those people as lesser than, as if they are not people with their own lives and problems. He seemed taken aback by this, which I thought was good to point out. It is so completely normal to ridicule those that are different from us and those who divert from the social norms. The collective Consciousness of Gen Z works through Social Media to change that.\n      Luckily with the addition of technology and fast spreading information, this is quickly changing. Information and ideas can be spread faster than ever now thanks to social media sites like TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and even Facebook. One or two videos that may talk about something such as spiritual deconstruction, capitalism, or even ADHD can be seen by over 5 million people within the span of one day. Another example includes Noodle the pug, the pug with bones or no bones. It has become a game among the TikTok community, as if it is some form of card reading or prediction telling us how our day will go depending on if Noodle the pug has bones. As I write this, it makes me laugh, what a ridiculous thing to think. But so many people that have seen those videos will completely understand the joke and agree. Opinions are another thing that can both spread quicker than wildfire fire, and quickly deter the thoughts, opinions or ideas of many young people today. Spiritual deconstruction is a large conversation amongst the TikTok community, and all it takes is one comment or one share of that video and everyone in your life feels about it.\n\n      Even the way the different generations get their news has changed. My parents still read newspapers and watch Fox News. All of my friends and I get our news mainly from Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram. Another difference between my parents' generation and mine is that my generation tends to listen to, appreciate, and even accept that everyone has different points of view.   Media literacy\u2026.It comes down to deciding which information is valuable, and valid, and safe to rely on. With hundreds of thousands of different opinions, ideas, thoughts, and information flying at you at all times, it takes serious work and time in order to decipher what the truth is.\n        Even our consumption of media, from movies, to musicals, to books and movies now contains these ideas. The recent My Little Pony movie even has come up with commentary on communism, racism, and even gender, now including the first ever male main character in a My Little Pony series. Cartoons such as Steven Universe, The Owl House, as well as She-Ra are breaking homophobic and gender stereotypes left and right, with multiple LGBTQ and non-binary characters, with large emphasis on representation. The world is changing fast, and the audience, or at least half of it prefers to change right along with it.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nGen Z and the End of our Humanity.

Even the \u201cstrict\u201d definitions of sex have some flexibility, while it may seem obvious to have the binary categories of male and female be applicable, where does that leave intersex people with ambiguous genitalia? Furthermore, what does this strict binary mode of thought mean for people who fall outside of the binary of the categories of man or woman? Based off my lived experience as a nonbinary-identifying individual, paired with my studying of sociological writings about gender, I conclude that even in today\u2019s progressive western society, it is nearly impossible to perform a gender identity outside of the binary given the unspoken \u201crules\u201d of how gender is performed. \nDespite always having a sense of confusion regarding my gender identity, I don\u2019t believe I heard the term \u201cnonbinary\u201d until I was around fifteen years old when the famous pop singers Sam Smith and Demi Lovato came out as nonbinary to the public. Despite my young age and lack of knowledge about the world, I still considered myself to be a fairly progressive individual, but I knew that I really had no grasp on what this term meant. All I knew was that some people had the preference to be referred to by a set of gender-neutral pronouns and names, but I didn\u2019t understand why, or how this worked. I couldn\u2019t figure it out at the time, but the feelings I had about my gender were persistent, I felt too masculine to fit into what I thought was the standard female mold, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was anything close to being a man either. It wasn\u2019t until I was eighteen and a freshman in college that the label of \u201cnonbinary\u201d started to resonate with me, and at the time it made sense. I didn\u2019t feel as though I could force myself into either category of male or female, so identifying as something outside of these strict categories felt the most comfortable and liberating for me. However, these feelings were short-lived, as it didn\u2019t take long for me to start realizing a troubling pattern was forming, and it caused me to question the foundations of my beliefs about sex and gender.\nWhen I first started identifying publicly as nonbinary at nineteen, I assumed rather naively that the transition would be an easy one. I informed my social circle of my new pronouns and changed nothing else about myself. It was at this point that I started to realize just how few people understood the label of nonbinary, the same way that I didn\u2019t understand what it meant just a few years prior. I was never maliciously misgendered by anyone, so I wasn\u2019t too hurt when people would still refer to me as a woman, but deep down I started to feel a mounting internal pressure to change aspects of myself to fit what I thought would be the ideal image of androgyny, to be \u201csuccessfully\u201d nonbinary, and I became obsessed with this concept. I started dressing more masculine on purpose, even if it made me uncomfortable, shortened my name to something I thought to be more gender-neutral, and I cut my hair short. Much to my dismay this decision proved to be a counterintuitive overcorrection, as people began to perceive my masculine gender display to be congruous with male-identification. I backpedaled and regressed to a more feminine fit; I dressed the same and kept my name, but I started wearing more makeup and growing my hair out, and it had the opposite effect. Once again people assumed that the more feminine display, despite my attempts at keeping some aspects of androgyny, must have meant I identified as a woman. I felt more than a little disheartened at this, but I was truly more curious than offended. How were people not perceiving me as a nonbinary individual? Was it a failing on my part, or was society to blame? I turned to West and Zimmerman\u2019s article \u201cDoing Gender\u201d for the answers for these questions and drew an interesting conclusion. \nProfessors at the University of California Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara respectively, Candace West and Don. H. Zimmerman co-wrote the article \u201cDoing Gender\u201d to explain the sociological concept of the same name. Essentially, the concept of \u201cdoing gender\u201d consists of the daily social interactions and behaviors that constitute one\u2019s gender expression. While the original purpose of this article was to explain how the process of performing gender is an ongoing accomplishment and it generates \u201cfurther means to create and maintain differences between women and men,\u201d I feel this same concept can be applied to the puzzle of performing genders outside of the binary and how the corresponding gender displays are so frequently misconstrued (West & Zimmerman, 138). According to their article, one\u2019s sex and gender identity are connected in a way that is composed of three main parts. The first, sex, is made up of the biological differences and is socially designated at birth. The second part, sex category, is the theoretical bridge connecting sex and gender; your sex category is the sex that you claim through external identifiers such as clothing, hair, and makeup. The third and final component is gender, which is comprised of the \u201croutinely fashioned\u201d social expectations of how one should act according to their sex and sex category (West & Zimmerman, 128). It is through the process of \u201cDoing Gender\u201d that the behaviors one performs either align with their sex and sex category, or clash and cause social confusion.\nIn my case, I believe West and Zimmerman would explain my dilemma as having to do with the growing gap of differences between men and women as well as the overcompensation that gender non-conforming people must perform in order to convey a gender display that matches their sex category. In the instance of their analysis of Garfinkel\u2019s study of the transgender teenage girl Agnes, they found that Agnes claimed to be \u201c120 percent female\u201d with her having to study the other women in her social circles in order to learn how to \u201cpass,\u201d or have her gender display match the sex category she was laying claim to (West & Zimmerman, 134). In the example of my three displays, I was either \u201cdoing gender\u201d too much or too little on the masculine and feminine sides, which resulted in other people misreading my displays. By cutting my hair short and dressing differently, I was performing too masculine of a gender, but by wearing makeup and having long hair I was performing the feminine equivalent, which made it appear that the sex category I was laying claim to matched my sex assigned at birth. However, it wasn\u2019t entirely my fault that this happened, as another possible explanation comes from West and Zimmerman\u2019s claim that the ongoing performance of gender and its subsequent roles results in the creation of differences between men and women. As these gaps between male and female gender continue to grow, trying to perform a gender display outside these two categories becomes increasingly difficult, as these perceived differences perpetuate and validate the strict binary of gender, making it nearly impossible to perform a gender outside of this binary without having it misread by one\u2019s peers. \nBased on my experiences with having my gender being mislabeled despite my multiple attempts at displaying an androgynous gender identity, along with West and Zimmerman\u2019s possible explanations that the sociological concept of \u201cdoing gender\u201d offered as to why this was happening, I can derive from my experiences and readings that in a society where a strict gender binary is enforced by the performance of gender roles and the \u201cgendering\u201d of objects such as clothing, makeup, and haircuts; that it isn\u2019t truly possible to perform a gender outside of the set parameters of what defines a man or woman. It isn\u2019t in the nature of our collective conscious to understand that a number of options could exist besides strictly male and female. The only way I could see a reformation of this strict viewpoint is through a collective effort in deconstructing the binary by a conscious effort of our society to not reenact and further perpetuate gender roles, opening the way for multiple identities to be valid options of gender displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nWest, Candace & Don H.
