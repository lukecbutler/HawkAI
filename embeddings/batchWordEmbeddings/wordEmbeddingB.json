        "text": "1486\nPsychology 105-001\n8 February 2024 \nJames, Cooley, and Social Media Pressures\n\tIt is no secret that everywhere we go we are surrounded by a different environment with many different people who all have their unique personalities. William James, a psychologist in 1890 presents the idea that we act differently depending on the different situations that we are in. This is what he calls the social self and the ability to naturally form our own groups. Along with this idea, Charles Cooley, who was a sociologist in 1902 presented the idea that we see ourselves through what we think that others feel about us and our appearance Many people today might refer to this change of personality or appearance as \u201cbeing fake\u201d or just simply \u201cplaying the part.\u201d But could we be straying farther and farther away from our true selves due to social media and all its presentations on how we should act and what we feel that others think of us?\n\tOn social media, we are portraying ourselves similarly to others while still having a hint of our personalities within. It is very easy to customize exactly what we want others to see or know about our personal lives. Many take this very seriously considering when a name is brought up, what is the first thing most of us do? We look them up and find anything we can to create a visual in our minds of what we think that person is like.  How we are on social media or around a new friend group we just met is very different than how we would act around our family or similarly, our closest friends that we grew up with which is an example of James and his main point. Although this is normally looked at as a bad action in most people\u2019s eyes, it is important to create these social bonds with others whom we are not as comfortable with. Similarly, how we act at our professional job plays a large role in how our boss views us which also affects our pay and our ability to buy the things that make us who we are or items that we feel we need to fit into the newest trend. \n\tSocial media has swept over the world in such a short amount of time and is continuing to grow at a very high rate. Many people who use social media are very easily convinced by influencers with a very high following. Whether this be through buying a product, looking a certain way, or just doing an activity the way that the influencers are doing it. Many feel a sense of importance or as if they are fitting in with societal norms by doing these activities. This way of life is like Cooley and his ideas about viewing ourselves through the eyes of others and what we feel their opinions are about us. Our likes, comments, and shares are what we feel define us and who are which is considered \u201clooking glass\u201d and how it influences our self-esteem. By using social media and following the tasks of influencers we are creating a sense of fitting in but are we being our true selves and embracing what we truly love as a unique individual? \n\tIt is very important to continue to embrace our true selves no matter what others think, but why is it so hard to do when everyone seems to be doing the same activities or looking a certain way? This is because we are viewing ourselves through what we believe others will say and think. If we are trying to post a picture on Instagram, we are thinking about the pose and what style of fashion others are posting right now as well. It\u2019s almost as if we are embarrassed to wear or be our natural selves on social media due to fearing others' opinions. \n\tIn conclusion, we are continuing to perceive ourselves more and more through what we feel others think about us due to all the different forms of social media. It is a constant loop of feedback and perception that we feel defines who we are and what we stand for. We will always present ourselves just the way we feel is necessary for a certain situation and how we want others to feel about us. Although it could feel like we are straying farther away from our true selves due to influencers and wanting to be like others, we will always have the twist that makes it unique to us. Although James' ideas are just as unique as Cooley's, social media is a great way to exemplify both and show how they can tie into one idea. Overall social media will continue to shape us into the person we are supposed to be whether that is by being our true self or by following in another\u2019s footsteps.  \t\n",

        "text": "The Beauty Myth: How Social Media Fuels the Fire\nHow often do you compare yourself to others as you scroll through Instagram, Facebook, or other social media platforms? Most people could say very often, especially teenage girls and young women. By comparing their physical appearances or even fashion choices to others, young girls are falling victim to societal beauty standards and accepting them. Although social media was created with the intention of bringing people together, it has caused a lot more issues than expected. Constantly seeing other females with the \u201cperfect\u201d body, hair, clothes, and life can cause young girls to feel very insecure about themselves. They may even feel like something is wrong with them because they do not look like the skinny Instagram model or the pretty girl from their high school that seems to get all of the boys. This leads to negative thoughts about one\u2019s appearance or self as a whole, and can even lead to eating disorders, anxiety, and depression. Such ideas of what the \u201cperfect\u201d female should look like and the obsession females have with their appearances stems from the beauty myth. As if the beauty myth was not bad enough on its own, social media makes it impossible to escape the grips of comparison while displaying unrealistic societal beauty standards.\nI can personally speak to how social media has affected me in a negative way and caused me to always compare myself to others. About two years ago, at the end of my junior year of high school, I noticed that I really started paying attention to what I looked like, and what the girls I followed on Instagram looked like. I would overanalyze everything about the pictures they posted and compare their appearances to mine. Were they prettier than me? Were their stomachs flatter than mine? Did they always have some sort of cute hairstyle? Were their clothes nicer and more fashionable than mine? And much more. These thoughts started to consume me and take up way more of my time and energy than they should have. \nIt is probably not a coincidence that this was happening at the same time the COVID-19 pandemic began. Since there was nothing else to do but sit at home, I was spending a lot more time on social media than I previously had been. This gave me more time to scroll and compare myself to these girls that I had never even met in real life. Were the bikini pictures they posted what they really looked like, or did they only look like that because they were posing and spent hours editing the picture? To me it did not matter and was not even something I had considered. All I was thinking was \u201cI wish I looked like that\u201d. After all of this started and a beach trip with my parents was quickly approaching, I decided to start working out a lot. It was not like I never exercised or did any physical activity to begin with, because it was actually quite the opposite. I played soccer from the time I was 4 years old all the way through high school, and I even ran cross country one year in addition to soccer. While most would have considered me an active person, I felt like I needed to exercise more, not for fun or for the sport I loved, but to change my body. \nI began waking up every morning during the week and going for runs in my neighborhood, then doing additional workouts in my garage. While I told my parents and friends that I was doing this to stay in shape and because, well, \u201cthe whole world is shut down so what else and I going to do?\u201d, my motives were a little different. My goal by exercising five days a week was to become thinner. Some mornings I genuinely enjoyed my runs, while others it was the last thing I wanted to do, but I made myself go anyway. For the entire summer I ran and did at home workouts hoping to look like the girls I was always comparing myself to. \nToday I still run and workout, but my motivation has completely changed. I work out to be healthier, to see growth, and as a stress reliever; not just to lose weight and look skinnier. The reason all of this occurred in the first place is due to the beauty myth. While I had no idea at the time, I was letting social media and the beauty myth control my life. \n  The beauty myth refers to the idea that women\u2019s value comes from their appearance and from being attractive. Societal beauty standards came into existence because of the beauty myth. Naomi Wolfe explains that the beauty myth is a result of feminism and the advancements women have made in society. Women now have a lot more freedom and power than they once did, making the beauty myth the only remaining old feminine ideology that still has serious control over women today. Wolfe also discusses how men use the beauty myth to maintain their dominance over women. If women did not feel constant pressure about their looks and feel the need to be considered beautiful by men, then men would lose their power over women. \nA common way that the beauty myth is used to control and oppress women can be seen in almost any business. When a woman works her way up to a position of authority or a high-level position, she often faces a lot of criticism. Men may make comments like, \u201cShe only got the job because of her looks\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s not actually qualified she's just hot\u201d. These comments show how deeply rooted the beauty myth is in society. Men will not be happy for a woman who has power, but if it were another male in the same position, they would likely be happy for them. When a woman holds significant power, she is attacked and ridiculed constantly because men feel threatened and jealous. Women feel they must be beautiful and fit into societal standards to be attractive and valued, but at the same time, beauty can also be used to disqualify them. Women are in a lose-lose situation because of this. \nWhen it came to my experience with social media causing me to feel like I needed to change the way I looked, the beauty myth was largely at play. Although my family always told me I was \u201cskinny\u201d, the beauty myth was telling me that I wasn\u2019t skinny \u201cenough\u201d. I felt that my value was in my appearance and that I needed to change how I looked in order to prove myself to others. Looking back now, I see that by comparing myself to every girl I saw on social media, I also felt like I was competing against them. I would see someone who looked a certain way and wished that I looked like that, but at the same time I disliked them for having what I considered to be a better physical appearance than me. Women seeing other women as competition is sadly another normal aspect of society that stems from the beauty myth. Competition between women only reinforces the beauty myth and prolongs the oppression women face. Previously I was unaware that the beauty myth even existed, but now it makes sense to me why I went through the things I did. \nUltimately, social media heavily reaffirms the beauty myth and makes it nearly impossible to not compare oneself to others, especially in the case of young girls and young women. Additionally, societal beauty standards are a result of the beauty myth and portray unrealistic expectations of what women should look like to be considered beautiful. The beauty myth causes a lot of emotional hardship for young women, and as I have personally experienced, can cause negative thoughts and views about oneself. ",

        "text": "5684\nWho\u2019s the Man? Identifying Hegemonic Masculinity and Defensive Othering\nDefensive othering and hegemonic masculinity are two interconnected concepts that play significant roles in shaping social dynamics, particularly in the context of gender relations. While these concepts operate in distinct ways, they both contribute to the maintenance of power structures and the perpetuation of inequality. Many people may unintentionally engage in behavior that aligns with these concepts. By highlighting these concepts\u2019 intersectionality, we can gain deeper insights into how they function and impact society. \n\nDefensive othering is the social process through which individuals assert their own identity and superiority by defining and marginalizing others as different or inferior. The process involves constructing and perpetuating stereotypes, prejudices, and narratives that emphasize the differences between \"us\" and \"them,\" often portraying the \"other\" as less worthy.\n\nThe term \"othering\" itself stems from the idea of perceiving certain individuals or groups as fundamentally different from one's own group. This process of othering serves to reinforce social boundaries by highlighting differences and reinforcing a sense of belonging within one's own group. Defensive othering involves a defensive response to perceived threats to one's identity or superiority, prompting individuals or groups to assert their dominance over others as a means of protecting their own sense of self-worth or social status.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is the idealized form of masculinity within society, embodying a set of norms that are viewed as being characteristic of \"real men\". Hegemonic masculinity shapes gender relations and power dynamics. Hegemonic masculinity can be portrayed through traits associated with power, aggression, competitiveness, and assertiveness. It also promotes emotional stoicism, discouraging displays of vulnerability. Hegemonic masculinity promotes independence and self-reliance, with an expectation for men to be self-sufficient and avoid seeking help or support from others. \n\nIt is defined in opposition to femininity, marginalizing qualities associated with femininity. While hegemonic masculinity may afford privileges to those who conform to its ideals, it also imposes limitations and pressures on men to adhere to narrow and restrictive gender norms. Hegemonic masculinity perpetuates gender inequality and reinforces harmful stereotypes\n\nDespite their differences, defensive othering and hegemonic masculinity are interconnected in several ways. Firstly, both concepts rely on the construction of binary oppositions between dominant and subordinate groups. In the case of defensive othering, this binary is often framed in terms of us versus them, with the dominant group asserting its superiority over the marginalized other. Similarly, hegemonic masculinity depends on the subordination of alternative forms of masculinity and femininity, positioning itself as the normative standard against which all others are measured.\n\nBoth defensive othering and hegemonic masculinity are deeply rooted in systems of power and privilege. Defensive othering serves to uphold existing power structures by reinforcing the social hierarchies that privilege certain groups over others. Similarly, hegemonic masculinity functions to maintain male dominance and control within patriarchal societies, granting men greater access to resources, opportunities, and social status.\n\nAn example of the intersection of defensive othering and hegemonic masculinity can be found in the phenomenon of toxic masculinity and its impact on gender-based violence. Toxic masculinity refers to the adherence to rigid gender norms and expectations that emphasize aggression, dominance, and control as essential attributes of manhood. This toxic form of masculinity is often reinforced through defensive othering, as men assert their superiority over women and other marginalized genders by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and attitudes.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario in which a group of male peers engages in locker room talk, objectifying and demeaning women in sexually explicit terms. In this scenario, defensive othering is evident as the men assert their own masculinity and superiority by dehumanizing and objectifying women as sexual objects. This behavior serves to reinforce their sense of male identity and group cohesion while marginalizing and othering women as inferior and unworthy of respect.\n\nAt the same time, this scenario also reflects the influence of hegemonic masculinity, as the men conform to societal expectations of what it means to be a \"real man\" by asserting their dominance and control over women. The normalization of such behavior perpetuates a culture of toxic masculinity that contributes to gender-based violence and discrimination against women and other marginalized genders.\n\nDefensive othering and hegemonic masculinity are inherently exclusionary, as they rely on the marginalization and subordination of certain groups in order to uphold the dominance of others. This not only harms those who are targeted by defensive othering and hegemonic masculinity but also reinforces harmful stereotypes and prejudices that harm society as a whole.\n\n",

        "text": "How the Collective Consciousness of the Education System is Corrupt\nFrom a young age, society teaches people the belief that having an education is a requirement to being successful in life, children are told that if they want a good job they must go to college and get a degree. This is a representation of collective consciousness, a \u201cfundamental sociological concept that refers to the set of shared beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge that are common to a social group or society\u201d (Cole). Collective consciousness forms a sense of unity and a feeling of belonging to a group, allowing us to establish an identity. Society exerts a powerful force on everyone's beliefs, norms, and values, causing them to behave certain ways and have similar beliefs of what is valuable in life. \nAnother way that the education system is corrupt is through the fact that wealthy Americans are using their money to bribe colleges into accepting their offspring. This has occurred at colleges including \u201cYale, Georgetown University, Stanford University, UCLA, the University of San Diego, USC, University of Texas and Wake Forest\u201d (Reeves). The reason behind the rich doing this is the idea of collective consciousness that we have that one\u2019s child(ren) must get into the absolute best school, which is especially common among the upper-class.\nThere are immoral factors that can contribute to unfair and corrupt college admissions, rather than illegal schemes. This can consist of the legacy preferences, which boosts an admission chance of the children of alumni which usually occurs in bigger, more desirable schools. \u201cA Princeton study found that being a legacy applicant had the same effect as adding 160 SAT points\u201d (Jones) giving the already well-off applicants an even greater advantage than that of the lower-income applicants. This shows how the upper-class have established this collective consciousness and view of themselves to where they are able to obtain more things and in turn stay successful. It was found that elite colleges such as \u201cDuke, Yale, Stanford, and Wake Forest take more students from families in the top one percent of the income distribution than from those in the bottom sixty percent combined.\u201d (Jones). With this statistic one can see how much more difficult it is for lower-class students to get admitted to a top tier college. How is this supposed to allow for one to break the cycle of their parents and go into a higher paying job with all odds against them? \nWeber\u2019s focus on the structure of society was focused on elements such as class, status, and power. Weber saw class as economically determined, meaning he believed that it was split between laborers and owners. However, Weber believed that one\u2019s status is based on noneconomic factors such as education. These two things, class, and status determined an individual\u2019s power, which held their influence over ideas. This shows how the upper-class can obtain more power and therefore be the ideal class that we all strive to achieve. This is where we have established and built a collective consciousness that to become powerful, you must be wealthy, and to become wealthy you must get a good job, and to get a good job you must go to college. \nCollege is not necessarily the way to achieve a successful life, there have been many instances where people did not get a college degree and still became successful. Some of these people include Steve Jobs (founder of apple), Ellen DeGeneres (TV host), Michael Dell, Rachel Ray, Alicia Keys, and more. Having this collective belief that one must go to college to get a good job puts a lot of pressure on children at an early age. It introduces them into society's judgements and that they will be considered disappointments or looked down on. \"We're saying to the kid, 'You're broken. You're defective. In some ways, these things become self-fulfilling prophecies\"(Whitaker). This quote shows that society is placing these negative thoughts into the child\u2019s head just because they do something different than the majority. This is not the answer, as a whole people should be uplifting and encouraging the upcoming generations to support their dreams and not settle for what society tells them is right. Some teachers like those who taught Steve Harvey told him he would never make it on TV, they labeled Albert Einstein as mentally handicapped, slow, and anti-social, also said that Thomas Edison was \u2018too stupid to learn anything.\u2019 Society should not be ridiculing young minds for having dreams to become something, just because it is not the social norm. \nAs a society we must begin to reestablish this collective consciousness and allow our generations to come to follow their dreams and make these decisions for themselves. The education system should be asking about an individual\u2019s hopes and dreams without shooting it down, saying it\u2019s unattainable. The system needs to adjust and incorporate independence of the mind to allow students to flourish rather than forcing them to all learn the same things. The education system should be helping teens find their strengths and talents by having them explore and practice new things. Through cultivating experiences, the education system can help teens explore various avenues or careers that best suit their strengths. This can relate to Marx\u2019s concept of false consciousness, which is a \u201ccondition in which the beliefs, ideals, or ideology of a person are not in the person\u2019s own best interest\u201d (Marx). \nAn example of how the current school system is failing to foster independent thinking is shown through the parents feeling pressured to make their children conform. In an article by Elizabeth Weil, she speaks of kids being sent home with a note that suggested they be tested for a \u201clearning difference\u201d. One of the parents ended up getting their child tested and paid about two thousand dollars for it. After her son protested the private tutoring for a while, her and her husband abandoned it. They later came to find out that every single one of the boys in their son\u2019s class had been referred for testing and he did not actually need it. So, what are these shared beliefs or mass consciousness that the American society has affecting the learning and education within our school system? The Fordham Institute conducted a study and reached three conclusions; \u201cAmerica\u2019s view on education is incoherent, Americans don\u2019t pay attention to their education or get involved, and much of what Americans think they know about their education policy is simply wrong\u201d (Jones). \nSurprisingly to find, public schools have a financial incentive to diagnose children with ADHD and ADD. It\u2019s stated that \u201cin 1991, eligibility rules for federal education grants were changed to provide schools with $400 in annual grant money for each child diagnosed with ADHD, as a result the ADHD cases soared\u201d (Jones). This fact shows just how corrupt the public school system can be, diagnosing children with disorders for their financial benefit. It is also said that today, more than \u201c7,000,000 children have been labeled and registered as permanent patients of the school system\u201d (Jones). An absurd number of children, especially males, have been diagnosed with ADHD through the school systems. This is an occurrence that should not be happening, and the education system needs to fix this as well as other issues. \nCollective consciousness is a social phenomenon, meaning that it is diffused across a whole society and has a life of its own. Through this collective consciousness that we establish, we can pass down different values, beliefs, and traditions to the upcoming generations. Collective consciousness is the result of these external social forces that course through society and that work together to create the social phenomenon of the shared set of beliefs, values, and ideas that compose it. \u201cWe, as individuals, internalize these and make the collective consciousness a reality by doing so, and we reaffirm and reproduce it by living in ways that reflect it\u201d (Cole). This means that the collective consciousness will always be present in society if we continue to pass on these ideals to future generations, which is negatively impacting the education system. The collective belief is that a higher education is the path to obtaining a successful life. However, without clarity and conviction to back this statement up, children and teens are being mislabeled. Instead of entrusting schools to shape children from an early age, we should allow children to prosper while gaining an education. The education system has a lot to work on, especially the aspect of allowing every person, regardless of their class or status, an equal and fair opportunity to succeed. Through the adaptation of our collective consciousness, we will be able to let our future generations grow with independent minds so they can change the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \nJones, Inez. \u201cTHE MASS CONSCIOUSNESS AND SCHOOLS.\u201d Joneswrite, 9 Feb. 2017, joneswrite.com/blog/2017/2/8/the-mass-consciousness-and-schools.\nLibretexts. \u201c1.2F: Durkheim and Social Integration.\u201d Social Sci LibreTexts, 16 Dec. 2020, socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Sociology/Introduction_to_Sociology/Book%3A_Sociology_(Boundless)/01%3A_Sociology/1.02%3A_The_History_of_Sociology/1.2F%3A_Durkheim_and_Social_Integration.\nReeves, Richard. \u201cIt\u2019s Not Just Corruption.

        "text": "0656\n\n\nIrving Goffman, however, introduced the theory of the front stage versus backstage self when trying to understand social interaction and perception. The front stage mainly represents the public image that an individual will present to other people intentionally. This side of the self-portrays the way we might act as a way to conform to the current social normalities and expectations of the current culture. The backstage, however, touches more on private and true self-expressions and actions where individuals feel they can act completely real and raw and get away from impression management they may deal with in front of others. This theory deals with a more fake vs. real approach when it comes to self-perception and authenticity. Even in the name itself, one might imagine the side of the self behind the curtain verses the side broadcast on stage for all to see. This theory suggests those are the two options of the self and emphasizes the skill of \u201creading the room\u201d. \n \tImagine a real-world scenario to illustrate these two theories. We will use a job interview. When applying for a job and going in for an interview, the applicant would most likely apply their front stage self by consciously picking and choosing what they decide to say, what they wear, and the demeanor with which they present themselves to impose favor on the interviewer to get the job. They will most likely discuss all their positive qualities and the positive things that they can do to meet the expectations of the job. This is an example of the social self as an individual and the way we navigate professional environments by choosing who we want to show up as and which role to play. This is also an example of front stage self. A very real possibility in this situation is that during the preparation for this, the person getting interviewed, could discuss how they feel they may not be good enough for the job and their insecurities regarding it to a friend on the phone. This shows their authentic backstage setting. In this setting, the person getting interviewed does not feel the need to impress or sway anyone and they can just show their true feelings which is also aligned with the spiritual self-concept from Williams.\nIn conclusion, I see accurate parts to both theories. William James\u2019 three selves theory does a good job of not keeping self-perception into one concise real versus fake box and for that reason I feel like it\u2019s a more inclusive and realistic way to paint out self-perception. However, Erving Goffman\u2019s front versus backstage gives a more closed approach that only allows a fake and real self. I personally believe that there is a lot more than fake versus real, and I align more with William James' three options because it allows for the ability to be real but selective. Both theories are well thought out and do a good job of explaining perception.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "6179\nAre You Reflecting or Acting\nErving Goffman has this idea that when we interact with people it is as if we are on a stage. By the word \u201cstage\u201d we are always putting on a performance around everyone. We might act differently in different scenarios based on evaluating the circumstance. From there we have a back stage and a front stage personality. We perform differently in front of certain people which is what separates the back from the front stage. The backstage is how we act to the people we are the closest and most comfortable with. While the front stage is the people that we put our main performance on for. \nThen we have Charles Cooley's idea of the \u201cLooking Glass-Self\u201d in which we view ourselves based on how we think other people see us. We use other people\u2019s opinions and thoughts on us as a reflection of who we are. We then take those opinions and judgments to refine how we act, portraying how we want them to see us. First someone might think about what others are thinking about them. Then they might imagine what the other person\u2019s judgement of their appearance. Lastly you react and respond based on what you think their judgements are. \nAccording to Goffman, when we are out in the real world searching for a job and attending a job interview we put on our front stage. Going into a job interview you want to be as professional as you can be. When you walk into the room of a job interview your mannerisms change, you say things differently and act accordingly for the situation. For example you shake their hand, you dress more professional than you would be in your back stage. You use appropriate formal etiquette and grammar, for instance you wouldn\u2019t use any type of \u201cslang\u201d words to come off unprofessional. Your body language is going to change by sitting up right, your going to smile and nod your head. By doing all of these things you are putting on your front stage on because it is as if you are putting you best foot forward. \nNow I want you to think of the times that you are having a game night with your friends and family, this would be where your backstage comes out. When you are with your friends and family you might make more jokes then you would in your front stage. Let\u2019s say you are having a game night and you win the game, you might yell, scream, jump up and down, etc. This is an example of your backstage because you wouldn\u2019t do these types of things in your front stage. The way you dress might also be different in that you would wear more \u2018comfy\u2019 clothes like sweatpants, sweatshirts, shorts, t-shirts. Your backstage comes our with the people you are most comfortable around. Some people refer to the back stage as your comfort zone or your true self. \nYou can compare the scenarios from a front stage and back stage from the moment you enter till the moment you leave. When you walk into a job interview you are most likely to shake their hand, smile, and introduce yourself. While if you walk in to you friends house to hangout you might hug them and say a more informal hello. Then during the middle of an interview you might talk in a very formal tone, good posture, and keep smiling. While if you are in the middle of hanging out with you friends you might say some dumb things or laugh a lot. Lastly by the end of your interview you would most likely get up and shake their hand and leave. If you are saying goodbye to your friends you might give them a hug good bye and talk while you are leaving. \nThe looking glass self could also be portrayed in an interview. When entering the interview you start to think about what the person conducting the interview is thinking. Then from there we respond to them based on what we think their judgements are. For example if you walk into an interview you might be thinking that they think you look presentable and well respected. From there you are going to continue to answer the questions from the interview in a well presented and respectable way. We tend to think that the person conducting the interview sees us that way because that is how we want to be seen. If we think that they believe we are respectable and well presented then we are more likely to act that way. \nLastly, another example of the looking glass self could be getting embarrassed when giving a speech. Imagine you are up on a stage or platform and you are giving a speech. When all of the sudden you look into the audience and you see some people giving you a look of disapproval. From there you are more likely to take that judgement in and you could possibly mess up your speech. We start by thinking what they are thinking about us. Therefore we might start to think that we are incompetent in our speech. Then we act upon it which might end up making us incompetent. ",

        "text": "SOC 105\n11 March 2021\nCapitalist Collective Consciousness\n\tCapitalism, in its design is one of the most controversial topics in society today with people constantly examining the pros and cons. Capitalism values labor and products differently which can fluctuate with time.  As an individual that has worked since starting high school, it is evident that humans in ourselves are commodities. To understand how capitalism works you have to understand that the commodities in our society are operated by a \u201cfree\u201d market, which means that there is no regulation to them. \n\tKarl Marx explains the concept of alienation through \u201cEstranged labor\u201d. In this article Marx better relates that an individual worker works for products that is not theirs because society deems it for survival. This relates to the concept of a \u201cfree\u201d market because the labor of the worker is a commodity, the value of the work is determined by the market. Max Weber in the \u201cSpirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage\u201d, relates the protestants to the modern-day society of capitalism. He proclaims that for the protestant\u2019s capitalism was predestined because of their work ethic. This work ethic led to the \u201ciron cage\u201d which contributes to the \u201cfree\u201d market by demonstrating that there is no regulation and no escape from it. Both of what Marx and Weber preached can be shown in modern day society through the minimum wage worker.\n\tI can relate to the capitalistic society and am familiar with how the ideology works. Being a minimum wage worker at Duck Donuts, I\u2019ve realized that the value of the product that I produced goes fluctuates throughout the year. At the beginning of the year business is slow, because of new year resolutions and people are trying to get in shape for summer. The value of my job changes from month to month because it a mainly labor-induced job. What sets myself apart from the theories of Marx and Weber, is that I don\u2019t work for survival in society. If that were not the case, the value of my labor would need to be higher than the exchange value that I put out. \n\tIn conclusion, it can be stated that through the commodity of labor, the value of a product is exclusive to the amount of effort. The relationship between the commodities makes the supply and demand for a variety of items. Along with supply and demand is the creation of a social hierarchy that promotes only individuals with high revenue value. ",

        "text": "Graded Essay 4\n\tThe Presentation of Self highlighted the idea that many of life\u2019s interactions mirror a stage-actor relationship. The individual is the actor and the stage is society. Every actor presents him or herself on a stage, wether that stage be before friends, acquaintances or strangers. Goffman saw this as an extremely common situation, which everyone participate in unconsciously or consciously. In his view, behaviors were shaped around responses to performances. More specifically, other\u2019s perceptions of us begin to form a collective impression of who we are in society. \n\tGoffman was groundbreaking in his ideas in the Presentation of Self. Harari further expounded upon the ties between Goffman\u2019s ideas and modern technological advances. With this insight, we can see a clear indication of small community degradation due to global communities beginning to uptick. Moreover, modern individuals have invested significant time and energy into their personal performance on global stages such as social media. The question still appears as, will we use new technology to increase community or watch as traditional communities degrade due to modern performances of individuals on the global stage?",

        "text": "4842\nHegemonic Masculinity and Women as \u201cThe Other\u201d in \u201cSex and the City\u201d\nIn the show \u201cSex and the City\u201d Carrie writes a column that delves into her, and her friends struggles with finding eligible bachelors in Manhattan. As a young woman myself, I can attest to the fact that it\u2019s nice to be taken care of and not have to worry about things in the company of a man. While that is true for most of the women in \u201cSex and the City\u201d, these women work hard for their lives and don\u2019t like it when they\u2019re not validated for their careers. Living alone in New York City takes a lot of hard work and each of these women clearly put in the work to do so. Simone de Beauvoir wrote about women being regarded as \u201cthe other\u201d because the man is the absolute which makes the women the object. Men are expected to have a successful career and become the provider for their family and women are just supposed to sit there and look pretty. One of the characters, Charlotte, is an art dealer. Naturally working in the city, she meets many famous artists. One day she met a big-time artist who invited her to his home upstate to see some of his new work. Charlotte makes the trip and soon realizes the artist is painting various women\u2019s body parts and wants her to model. De Beauvoir states men view women's body as an obstacle and is instantly burdened by everything it touches.  A woman becomes \u201cthe other\u201d because the man is the absolute and therefore society allows men to disregard women\u2019s ideas and opinions. This happens quite often on the show and in the real world. De Beauvoir states women have always been subordinated to men because men felt they were more essential to society. Charlotte was shocked by the artist's actions and decided to leave; causing the male artist to change his view on her from \u201cthe other\u201d.  Women are frequently viewed as having \u201ctoo many\u201d emotions and hormones which society says makes them less equip to make real-world decisions. Clearly the women in this show are very successful and do not need men to tell them otherwise. \nMany women would say some men can be regarded as having large egos and little regard for women. This is true when it comes to hegemonic masculinity; which is the practice of upholding the dominant nature of men. This concept is showcased in season one, episode two of the show \u201cSex and the City\u201d. In this episode, Carrie\u2019s doing research on men who only sleep with models. One of her friends, Barkley is what the women call a \u201cmodelizer\u201d, or a man who only sleeps with models. This is regarded as hegemonic masculinity because people are just allowing this behavior to happen, as if it isn\u2019t degrading not only to the models but to average women. In this episode, Barkley talks about meeting the models and he mentions \u201cyou gotta treat them like they\u2019re regular girls\u201d (Barkley), as if they\u2019re a different bread than any other woman. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable because as mentioned above, this also makes women viewed as \u201cthe other\u201d. Hegemonic masculinity is also displayed in season one, episode five. Carrie sleeps with a man from France while he\u2019s in town on business. When she wakes up the next morning after he left the hotel, she finds an envelope with one thousand dollars in it. While some women may appreciate this, Carrie was appalled at the fact that he thought that was necessary. By this man paying Carrie, it put him in a dominant position over her and made her feel inferior to him. She felt disappointed because besides their physical lust for each other she felt like they had a great connection. Carrie didn\u2019t know \u201cwhether to take it as an incredible compliment or as an incredible insult\u201d (Bradshaw). In the writing by Brett Stroudt, he feels hegemonic masculinity can help men appreciate women for the \u201cmothering\u201d love they give men. This statement could be true, but also men should recognize women bring much more to their lives than acting as their mother. In general, men have this invisible power over women, and they exercise this power by participating in hegemonic masculine behaviors such as being assertive and aggressive. \nWomen have come so far in being able to accomplish their hopes and dreams over the years. Men tend to view women as \u201cthe other\u201d, but the women in the show \u201cSex and the City\u201d withstand this stereotype as they are all very successful without the guidance of a man. A lot of men in the show also participate in hegemonic masculinity behaviors. Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda all have their fair share of interactions with these men, and they realize they\u2019re let down consistently by this behavior. The women in this show discover how these concepts affect typical women and they ultimately try to do everything in their power to resist hegemonic masculine behaviors and being viewed as \u201cthe other\u201d. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105 \u2013 Reflection Essay\nOctober 18th, 2021\nThe Beauty Myth\nBeauty myths are societal standards of beauty that are based on individual cultures and can have many different elements. In every culture, however; a beauty myth describes what a certain group of people should look like. Although many different people can beautiful, the standards are always set by the dominant group in society. This generally means that men set standards for how women should look, with complete disregard to each woman\u2019s physical or emotional strengths. Every standard is set through gender norms that have been widely accepted in that culture. There can also be many different gender norms, so depending on where or who is a part of the society, there are traits and qualities that each gender is supposed to have or develop.\nIn today\u2019s United States society, all people have equal rights. This does not mean that beauty myths are no longer present. We have many standards that are expected, and only time can help this trend crumble. Since the United States is such a diverse country, with people from around the world calling it their home, there are many different standards that have prevailed. In nearly every civilization throughout history, a single group has controlled the power, which almost always has led to discrimination and \u201cothering.\u201d Othering and defensive othering are both ways to label some person or some group as other. If you are labeled as other, you are not only subjected to discrimination and/or oppression, but also held to different and unrealistic standards.\nThe term \u201cbeauty myth\u201d was coined by Naomi Wolf in 1990. In her book, she talked about societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, particularly placed on women in the West. The age of new feminist ideas previously brought freedom, but Wolf argues that also brought preconceived notions of beauty standards, self-hatred, physical obsessions, terror of aging, and other \u201cpolitical weapons\u201d used against women\u2019s advancement in society. Once women gained the same rights as men, they were still thought less of, which meant that men saw a woman\u2019s value solely based on looks, rather than their actions. This cultural shift subjected women to unrealistic standards, and men belittled women who could not achieve the beauty standards already set in place.\nWomen are subjected to this beauty myth, according to Naomi Wolf, as a form of retaliation or backlash against 2nd wave feminism. During this time, the objectification of women was taken to a new level with new forms of media. Men had previously controlled society, so subjecting women to these standards seemed like a natural way to gain back cultural control. For example, women felt discriminated against as they aged, while men were thought of as wise, powerful, and successful as they aged. In some areas, this type of disparity is still found today. Throughout history and various cultures, strong men battled for beautiful women. It was thought that beautiful women were the most reproductively successful, although that has never had scientific-backing. According to Naomi Wolf, male dominated institutions are fearful of strong independent women having equal freedoms, which led to more discrimination and additionally turned women against each other.\nMen are also held to standards, but it has never been institutionalized in Western cultures. Toxic masculinity is a standard that has been perpetuated by men to other men, and scientists conceived the term \u201chegemonic masculinity\u201d to explain this. For example, men are told they need to be strong, wealthy laborers who provide for their families while never showing emotion. Additionally, men are subjected to certain physical standards, primarily height, which can be comparable to a beauty myth, but these standards cannot be institutionalized since women are not superior to men today. Men were once legally superior to women in the United States and many countries in the West, so it is not a comparable standard. However, in the Mediterranean from around 25,000 BCE to 700 BCE, women controlled the power in their society. In this culture, powerful women controlled the economy and often had many expendable male lovers. This example would be an accurately comparable beauty myth for men, but this is an outlier over many generations and geographical locations.\nI have experienced and observed many examples of the beauty myth playing out in society. There are many preconceived notions of how women are supposed to look and dress even in 2021. Growing up in the Charlotte area, I noticed how people thought my sister and my mother should act and present themselves. My mom is a strong and beautiful woman, now 51 years old, so she is experiencing the criticism from society particularly as she is aging. For the last few years, she has clearly been aging, as she should be, but rather than people complimenting her for any of her amazing qualities, she gets criticized or joked about for having new wrinkles and/or grey hair. My father on the other hand gets complimented for looking young, even though my parents are the same age. Since I was a pre-teen, I have seen a lot of discrimination in how men are treated compared to how women are treated, and even though we are all equal in today\u2019s culture, women are still thought less of by many people. In school I would always hear my friends and classmates degrade women who were attractive by only referring to them with sexual innuendos rather than for their personality. I do not believe it is unfair to judge someone for their looks (since everyone is attracted to looks), but I do believe it is wrong if those judgements continue to name calling or discrimination. There are many beauty standards in our culture that I have been aware of, and even thought myself, but belittling anyone for traits and qualities that are completely incontrollable is unfair and only continues this trend of inequality. \nJust as I have seen beautiful women belittled, I have seen many more women discriminated against for not meeting our society\u2019s beauty standards. If a woman is too overweight or too skinny, they were made fun of and never given the attention that \u201cbarbie doll\u201d women got from men. If a woman does not have the most attractive smile, or even dress a certain way, they are also thought to not conform to the norms of society. No matter which facet of beauty is criticized, women almost always start with a disadvantage. Growing up with only an older sister, I also got to see many ways that young women were discriminated against, even if they are beautiful. My sister is a beautiful 24-year-old now, so three years older than me. Even though many people thought she was a good-looking girl, she was frequently targeted by toxic men who had closed minds. My sister is not the slim, blonde haired, blue-eyed model that many men expect their ideal women to look like. If she dyed her hair any color, she was criticized. If she gained any weight, she was made fun of. If she liked certain sports, like basketball and golf, she was labelled a tom-boy. My sister is very independent and has never relied on her significant other to take care of her, which has made long term relationships hard for her. Yet this quality of hers is one that I personally respect the most.\nWhile I grew up, I was certainly picked on for not conforming to every gender norm, but since I am a man, much of that discrimination came from other men. For as long as I can remember, women have been expected to look their best in every situation, while men are not held to that same standard. Women in modern cultures are pushed to wear makeup, provocative clothing, and act \u201clady-like.\u201d I went to middle school and high school with many people who did not conform to the traditional gender roles, so I frequently saw them targeted by (mostly) men who expected them to look a certain type of way. For example, my friend Thalia in middle school always dressed very neutral and would wear clothes that were not particularly women\u2019s style, and she was criticized. If she had to dress up for a presentation, she would wear nice clothes, but would never wear a dress and heels. This type of attire is not rare to see in society, but because our parents and older friends perpetuated these gender norms, it is still a prevalent criticism today. Fast forward to Thalia in late high school and she was thought of as an icon for her style, because she did try to look presentable and trendy, she just did not conform to traditional women\u2019s attire.\nAlthough the beauty myth is still ongoing today, I believe that society is progressing, and women are beginning to be treated as true equals in society. Just as religion and ethnicity are still criticized, gender norms and beauty myths will still be placed on women for some time. This does not mean that we stop pushing back against these standards, because that is the only way to truly rid these standards from society. Women are just as human as men, so I hope that toxic men will start to realize the negative impacts their ideals have on women and society. Beauty has always been held to a high standard, and I doubt that will change, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Beauty can be found in everything; we just need to start opening our eyes and ears to find the beauty in everyone.\nI believe that most gender norms and beauty myths are carried out primarily by young men and women, so proper parenting is very important to get rid of these problems in our society. Society has always placed pressure on certain groups to act or look a certain way, but in the United States in 2021 I believe that we have the most freedom of any culture throughout history. This has allowed us to break many barriers that have held back human civilizations of the past. As a collective society, everyone wants equality, even though politics of today have divided us greatly. Just as racism and slavery has been prevalent in many cultures throughout history, so are some of these beauty myths. The United States has allowed for the most advancement in human history, for women and other groups, so I have hope for the future. ",

Being a Male Asian-American that can afford college and has the resources to be successful shows an incredible amount of predisposed privilege. I have come to recognize this privilege and have realized that social standing is in direct correlation with how society sees you. \n\tThis concept can be better understood through the eyes of Peggy McIntosh\u2019s \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d. McIntosh discusses the white privilege that she has, of which including how she can watch tv and she can see white people being positively symbolized. This puts strain and mental frustration over time on the oppressed groups of people. In reference to George Herbert Mead\u2019s theory, the conceptualization of ourselves is dignified by symbolic interactions within a community. This corresponds with each other because as the oppressed community observes how negatively society sees them, it makes the notion that they are looked down upon.\n\t\u201cWhite Privilege\u201d shows that you are not taught to see white privilege, moreover you are taught that racism is individual acts of rather than your initial status. This perception that the oppressed groups experience shapes their status and what they can accomplish in society. All privileged members of society must recognize their privilege, for the oppressed people to have fair opportunities.\n\t\n  \n\t\n",

Author of \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d, Naomi Wolf, discusses in her writing that women are constantly objectified and required to uphold certain beauty standards.\u00a0 Wolf begins her reading by stating \u201cThe affluent, educated, liberated women of the First World, who can enjoy freedoms unavailable to any women ever before, do not feel as free as they want to.\u00a0 During the past decade, women breached the power structure; meanwhile, eating disorders rose exponentially and cosmetic surgery became the fastest-growing medical specialty\u201d (Wolf 1990).\u00a0 Wolf provides the information that proves the fact that women are notoriously expected to uphold traditional feminine values and ideas.\u00a0 This expectation of upholding feminine values relates to how women are often discriminated against in their professional careers.\u00a0 Wolf also presents that women struggle with confidence by expressing \u201cIt is no accident that so many potentially powerful women feel this way. We are in the midst of a violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women\u2019s advancement: the beauty myth. As a woman released themselves from the feminine mystique of domesticity, the beauty myth took over its lost ground, expanding as it waned to carry on its work of social control\u201d (Wolf 1990). Wolf provides proof that women who are discriminated against lack confidence due to the inappropriate treatment they generally receive. Women are often inclined to be the \u201cnurturing mother\u201d and be the main caretaker, given no room for exploration or individuality, that of which is in plethora for men.\u00a0 This assumption feeds into employers, impacting their actions on ideology to prefer hiring men over women.\u00a0 The false beliefs that society has allowed employers to believe brings in an idea of women\u2019s supposed \u201clack of time\u201d.\u00a0 Gender inequalities bombard every aspect of women's lives and are a huge issue in the workplace especially. Naomi Wolf helps to bring awareness to this unjust treatment.\u00a0\nWomen are often treated in inequitable ways in the workplace.\u00a0 \u201cWomen encounter discrimination in hiring and are less likely to be perceived as capable and committed to the occupation than men\u201d (Friedman 2015).\u00a0 This discrimation comes about because of the stereotypes created in society.\u00a0 Those stereotypes often perceive women as having \u201cwomanly duties\u201d which include the idea that mothers should solely take care of the kids, cook, and clean.\u00a0 On the other hand, there are also stereotypes towards men that state that the man of the house should be the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d.\u00a0 While these stereotypes have declined in the 21st century, they are still valid within occupational environments.\u00a0 These assumptions that women should stay home while men make money cause the view that women have less time and commitment for higher authority jobs and that they simply are not suitable for some careers.\u00a0 This is something that absolutely should not be assumed based on the gender of someone.\u00a0 Because women are expected to be in charge of family care and childcare, they are often in need to take time off to do so. \u201cBecause women are more likely to anticipate interruptions in paid employment, they may be unwilling to make the long-term commitment to an employer that a position of authority often entails'' (Wolf and Fligstein 1979).\u00a0 To employers, not being able to work long hours is a disadvantage, making it more likely for a man to be hired over a woman. While one should obviously be hired due to their knowledge, skill, and cooperation within the workplace, employers should not conclude these qualities based on the stereotypes of women.\nFor years, the gender pay gap has been a very controversial topic because many believe that it is a myth.\u00a0 Regardless of some beliefs, a gender pay gap has been proven time and time again.\u00a0 The gender wage gap is \u201ccited at 77 cents to every dollar\u201d (Friedman 2015).\u00a0 This means that on average, males in the US receive twenty-three cents per dollar higher than the average female.\u00a0 Although this gap has decreased overtime, it has been stable for quite some time now.\u00a0 Most of this gap occurs due to factors such as job training and education, but there is still an unexplained 9% of the wage gap.\u00a0 This 9% is believed to occur solely because of discrimination.\u00a0 Over 50 years ago, the United States passed the Equal Pay Act, requiring that employers pay men and women equally for doing the same work.\u00a0 If two employees are doing the same work, they should be paid the same, but unfortunately this is not always the case.\u00a0 For example, in professional athletics, men are usually paid more than women.\u00a0 This is done because men\u2019s sports achive higher revenue, allowing them to receive higher earning.\u00a0 Mariq states \u201c90% of sports television hours have been devoted to men\u2019s sports, whereby women\u2019s sports are viewed as less significant for media coverage\u201d (Marig 2020). Women\u2019s sports can be just as engaging as men\u2019s sports which is why the media coverage for men and women in the same sport should equal. Overall, pay should be duplicate for men and women because it should be based solely off of skill and nothing else.\nWe often think of specific jobs as predominantly achieved by a male or female.\u00a0\u201cGendered organizations are workplaces where advantage and disadvantage, corrupt and control, action and emotion, meaning and identity patterned through and in terms of a distinction between male and female, masculine and feminine\u201d (Mastracci and Arreola 2016). Gender norms have constantly been a pattern for years and is based solely on stereotypes of men and women. Like mentioned earlier career paths and pay should not be justified by gender, but by skill and hard work.\u00a0 Studies show that \u201cWomen predominantly major in fields that steer them into lower-paid occupations such as humanities, education, and social sciences such as psychology, while men major in fields, such as science, engineering, and business, that lead to higher-paying jobs\u201d (Kugler, Tinsley and Ukhaneva 2021).\u00a0 This segregation is an issue causing women to be too intimidated to break the pattern of male predominant jobs.\u00a0 Men are also more likely to be given positions of authority over women.\u00a0 \u201cRecent research has shown that women are much less likely than men to be in positions of authority, even when they have the same level of education and occupational status, and that this difference cannot be explained by the fact that men are more likely to be self-employed\u201d (Wolf and Fligstein 1979).\u00a0 Something must be done to create careers to be sexually unbiased.\u00a0 Research shows that this process has been \u201cstalled\u201d and as a whole we must stop the segregation of female and male career paths.\u00a0 Cross\u2010national research suggests that an even greater focus on men's roles and movement into historically \u201cfeminine\u201d domains is necessary for ultimately dismantling the persistent gender gap and \u201cinstalling\u201d the gender revolution (Friedman 2015).\u00a0 Because men are primarily working the higher paying jobs, they are less likely to want to be a part of the female prevalent jobs, due to the lower income.\u00a0 Like Friedman stated, to \u201cunstall\u201d the gender revolution we must mix the genders practicing these sex labeled careers to provide a fair workspace for both genders.\nThroughout history, women have been treated as \u201cless than\u201d in all aspects of life but particularly the workforce.\u00a0 While the list of these inequalities is a lengthy one, just a few include that of unequal pay, discriminatory treatment, and sex labeled careers.\u00a0 It is important to note that inequalities occur all around us.\u00a0 Women and men see gender inequalities within their homes and communities every day.\u00a0 Some men still see women as caregivers and responsible for the household when they need to start seeing women for who they are today.\u00a0 Today's women are self-sufficient, independent, and powerful.\u00a0 They are highly educated, strong, reliable, and persistent.\u00a0 By keeping women from various aspects of the workforce, it is simply just a disservice to the economy.\u00a0 What this issue truly boils down to is that we, collectively, men and women, need to do more to improve gender equality. By educating communities of the disparities between genders, we can break down the barriers of inequality and change societal norms.\u00a0 It is time to see more women in positions of power. There should be no discrepancy towards females in the workplace, or even in life. Men and women should be observed and valued the same. Gender should not be the characteristic that defines us or separates us from our fellow coworkers.\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nFriedman, S. (2015). Still a \u201cStalled Revolution\u201d?

        "text": "4842\nGoffman breaks down \u201cthe self\u201d into two main parts; the performance and the character. Before we get into the separate parts, it\u2019s important to understand \u201cthe self\u201d as a whole. According to Goffman, there is no \u201ctrue self,\u201d but instead it\u2019s a consolidated illusion we\u2019re constantly changing and putting on. \u201cThe self\u201d provides us with the necessary resources to act suitably when presented with a stimulus. While \u201cthe self\u201d provides us with these assets, it can also be a product of the performance we\u2019re putting on. With that said, the performance is the production we put on and maintain while presenting ourselves to diverse audiences. The performance also varies depending on who the spectators are. For example, we typically act differently at school or work compared to when we\u2019re with our friends. This brings us into the character, which is the outcome of the performance. \u201cThe self\u201d includes the psychobiology of our personality whereas the character is the way we perform to leave a certain impression on people. The character allows us to control how the audience will react to us because we attempt to produce reactions as if we\u2019re an outsider looking in. With these parts of the self-production working simultaneously, it allows us to correctly acknowledge a stimulus. \nWhile Goffman breaks \u201cthe self\u201d into two parts, James divides it into four main parts; the material self, social self, spiritual self and the pure ego. James feels the total of a man\u2019s self consists of everything he can call his. Not just his body or thoughts, but everything he physically owns and anything that gives him some type of emotion. The Material self is the physical aspects of one\u2019s life they identify with, such as their clothes, cars, house, etc. The Social self is how peers view us and our role in a specific context. The Spiritual self consists of our beliefs or values, consistency in our reaction to stimulus and our relative emotions or behaviors. The Pure Ego is the most comfortable we can get; it\u2019s our unseen essence and how an individual views themself. Using these four categories, James divides aspects of our personality into being a part of the \u201cme\u201d or the \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cme\u201d is our response to external stimuli, and how our interactions create the experience of the self. The \u201cme\u201d is also referred to as our social self; how we act in social situations. While the \u201cI\u201d is our answer to how others view us and what we\u2019ve learned subconsciously from interactions with people. \nBetween Goffman\u2019s and James\u2019 concepts, we\u2019re able to use several aspects of each to reply to stimuli accordingly depending on what type of social situation we\u2019re in. Goffman believes we adjust our behaviors to act a certain way in social settings while James feels we use our own emotions to react to an event. By using these techniques together, we can appropriate the correct response to any factors we encounter outside or inside the body. For example, social media has a huge influence on everyone, and it\u2019s where people seek the approval of others. When anyone makes a post on social media, they first embody the performer; posting something they feel others will enjoy. Then the character and social self come into play because depending on the feedback we get; we\u2019ll act in response to that. The character and social self are concerned with how others view us, and they generate our justification of our actions. Next comes the pure ego, which will help us connect what we\u2019ve learned from this interaction to our past, present and future presence on social media. We may not realize it, but we\u2019re constantly enduring social and emotional stimuli to determine our response based on how we feel others will perceive it. \nInteracting with and reacting to people is part of our day-to-day life, even if we don\u2019t realize it. As much as humans try not to, we care about what others think of us, and we\u2019re constantly trying to act the way we want others to perceive us. Overall, the evidence shown throughout Goffman and James\u2019 work provides us with an appreciation for our reaction to social and emotional stimuli. Using a combination of Goffman and James\u2019 concepts, we can better understand how we form connections with others based upon our actions. ",

        "text": "SOC 105-001\n02-05-2021\n\nEssay Brief 2\n\tThe human experience is entirely centered around the person, themselves. At first glance this sounds fairly obvious, yet there is a time in everyone\u2019s life where they question the essential origin of who they are. The question of \u201cWho am I?\u201d, is a core component of true self-actualization and proves to be a valuable part of every human\u2019s experience. To effectively answer questions such as these, there must be a delineation and separation between what role the physical body plays and what the self, or metaphysical being plays in who a person is. In addition to this delineation, the Self has been further broken down into components that aide in understanding the role that the Self carries out. \n\tMead sought to delineate between the Self and the body in which the Self resides. He specifically advocates for the idea that the Self and the organism are completely distinguishable. The body refers to the organism, or the physical portrayal of the Self. Simply stated, the body is the anchor to which the self adheres. The Self refers to the metaphysical attributes that compose every persons\u2019 being. These two, separate components are what collaborate to form the person or the being. Complimentary to Mead\u2019s work, James brought an even more specific approach to the understanding of what the Self is. He believed that there are four components of the Self: the natural self, social self, spiritual self, and the Ego. The natural self is said to be what one possesses in material goods, and in companionship or close relationships. The social self is composed of the ideas and perceptions that others have about someone. The spiritual self is the totality of someone\u2019s moral and ethical actions and beliefs. And finally, the Ego is the personality of one\u2019s being. These four components directly compose the metaphysical self, as described my Mead. From these explanations, it is evident that all aspects of the Self collaborate to form the metaphysical being. The four components of James\u2019s Self are equally important, and interface with Mead\u2019s delineation seamlessly.\n\tThe question of who one is, will never be answered completely. However, Mead and James\u2019s work towards answering that question provides significant insight into how everyone can view themselves more accurately. By breaking down the Self, one can understand the areas in which they are unique. Those qualities of Self, in conjunction of the understanding that the body is separate, gives a well-rounded picture as to what essentially a being consists of. These ideas are revolutionary to the understanding of how every being or person is composed, and their concepts may prove to be increasingly valuable through human development. ",

        "text": "0167\nSOC 105\nMay 1st, 2023\nThe Presentation of the Self\nOne Question I repeatedly hear from my roommate is, \u201cWhy are you always so hard on yourself?\u201d For example, I complain about my grades if they are less than an A, as well as if I make a perfectly normal mistake. However, despite my errors, she accepts me the way I am in these instances, mainly because roles such as academia and responsibility are not what I am required to prove to her. Throughout different \u201cscenes\u201d over the course of our lives, we put on new costumes, act as different characters, and engage in different roles the best we can. However, it is only natural that like in any performance, we forget our lines or trip on stage. This has the potential to disrupt the balance within the production. Upon this occurring, it can embarrass and make others uncomfortable. So, why do we take ourselves so seriously? I believe this is a question that us as humans do not analyze enough. At the end of the day, maybe our best performances are improv. \nThroughout my personal life, my specific roles and characters change immensely from situation to situation. When I was growing up, I noticed that in every friend group, I played the role of the \u201cdumb\u201d one, frequently being teased for my awkward jokes or irrelevant comments. I have always been told that I am an \u201ceasy target\u201d for teasing, as well as \u201cwe aren\u2019t laughing at you, we are laughing with you\u201d a countless number of times. Although this was true sometimes, it does not mean it did not offend me. This trend additionally followed me into middle school as well as high school within the friend groups I would weave through. If I would get upset from the \u201cplayful\u201d teasing, then I would be taking it too seriously and take the fun out of the joke. This ties back to the role I played among my friend groups. My role is making silly mistakes for the purpose of others laughter and entertainment. I have accepted that this is my role and that it is this way because that is what my friends expect from me and accept me for. However, in other scenarios, such as my family and academics, playing the role of the \u201ceasy target\u201d would be disappointing. \n\tIf I am performing the role of daughter, I am expected to be responsible, independent, and live up to the expectations of my older sister. In order to do these things, I have to hold myself accountable for my grades, actions, expenses, and other things that come with being grown up. This means always working hard to supply myself with money, always getting straight A\u2019s, and handling my real-world issues on my own. This role of the put-together, smart, independent girl is far from what I experience around my friends. I am required to transform from the silly bubblehead girl to the smart and sophisticated women. Being all these things and not slipping up is very difficult and trust me, I have fallen out of character many of times before. When this happens, I get hit with an \u201chow could you\u201d attitude. When my role is questioned, others around me do not know how to react. When the critics does not like the performance, they will be sure to let you know in the reviews. \n\tIn Erving Goffman\u2019s piece, \u201cPresentation of Self\u201d, he illustrates the idea of us as humans, presenting ourselves as though we are performers on a stage, and these performances make up the self. He states, \u201cthe very structure of the self can be seen in terms of how we arrange for such performances in our Anglo-American society\u201d (Goffman). Face to face interactions give us a role to fill and stage where we preform them. We gain a sense of self and identity through social encounters and preforming these roles. \u201cA correctly staged and preformed scene leads to audience to impute a self a preformed character\u201d (Goffman). We take our characters very seriously because they give us a role in the social world. Therefore, living up to these expectations is very important to us. \n\tWe are constantly searching for meaning in our lives. Humans strive to find a place in this society. This is why we participate in collaborate meaning-making processes like religion, clubs, activist group, etc. We have seen this trend in our world for thousands of years. We appeal to the collective conscious to fit in so that we can relate to one another and give meaning to this life. We live in the ideas of narratives to give explanation to the external world and create roles for ourselves to play. With all this being said, it is only natural that we want to play our roles the best we can in order to feel fulfilled in life. \n\tI feel as though I, as well as others, take my roles very seriously because without them, I feel as though I have no purpose. We strive to appeal to the standards that the social creates. Through these standards and expectations, the self emerges and is shaped through trial and tribulation. When I am with my friends, I know the type of person they expect me to portray. I know what to say, the jokes to make, and the way to act. With my family, I know how to turn myself into the responsible, academic, and mature daughter they raised me to be. I know what jokes to slide into the conversations and when to be silly at the right time, without breaking my reputation. Breaking our character means breaking our reputation, which leaves us in the world with an unfilled purpose and lack of meaning.   \n\tSo why do we take ourselves so seriously? As described throughout this paper, it is to find and create meaning for us. We want to feel fulfilled in our interactions and contribute positive meaning to the world around us. Like we see in religion, organizations, and many other things, we want meaning to explain our purpose in this world. All of this is very understandable and reasonable ways to think. Society has engraved in our minds the type of people we are supposed to be and the characters we are expected to portray. In my own life, I demonstrate needing to find meaning within social interactions. I allow myself to play a role that I am not always comfortable with because it gives me a purpose in my friend group. In my family, I let them hold me up to higher standard because I want them to be proud of me. I need to fulfil that role the best I can in order to feel like I have meaning to them. \n\tAs humans, we are bound to take ourselves too seriously. This idea has been constructed and enforced by the social for a very long time. I think striving for meaning in our lives is a trend we will never break out of. However, I think instead of taking ourselves so serious in our roles, we should learn to break out of character sometimes. If we didn\u2019t limit ourselves to what is expected of us, we can discover more about ourselves as people. Also, if we criticized less when people stepped out of their roles, everyone would feel more accepted when they cannot live up to others standards. Overall, I think we all need to be less hard on ourselves about meeting the expectations of others and ourselves. Being authentic in all circumstances may lead to a happier and better state of mind.\nWorks Cited\nGoffman, Erving. \u201cPresentation of Self.\u201d Taylor and Francis, 1977, pp. 255\u2013257. \n",

        "text": "Introduction to Sociology\n25 November 2021\nHarari Compared to Previous Topics\nIn the book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, written by Yuval Noah Harari, there are a variety of different topics covered. These topics include discrimination, nationalism, the dubiousness of individuality, and groupthink, among other things. Many of the topics that Harari covers in his books can be related to the topics that were discussed in our class, earlier on in the semester. Some of them may complement each other well. They may also disagree with each other, and there may be contradictions between concepts. In this essay, I hope to analyze the differences and similarities between the concepts and ideas presented in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century and the ideas that we have previously learned about in this class. \nSomething that Harari brings up in the \u201cIgnorance\u201d chapter of his book is the idea that individuality is a myth. In his words \u201cHumans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups.\u201d (Harari, 222). Harari says that it is humanity's ability to think as a group that has set us apart from all other species on the planet. This is called \u201cgroupthink\u201d. To Harari, groupthink is not inherently bad, but depending on the circumstance, it can be dangerous. On one hand, humans being able to put their knowledge together has helped us to become smarter collectively. It allows us to complete complex tasks that we may not have otherwise been able to do, had we acted as individuals. However, on the other hand, groupthink can be harmful, or even detrimental. For example, imagine if someone proposed an idea that is damaging to a certain group of people. If the majority of people not belonging to that group are convinced that this idea is a fact, then it could cause them to become prejudiced towards that group. In some cases, that belief could become institutionalized, leading to generations of harm done to the group. The concept of groupthink is interesting, as it shares similarities with concepts that have been discussed earlier in the semester, while also contradicting some of the other concepts that we have learned about. The idea of groupthink has some similarities to the concept of collective consciousness, a concept that was developed by \u00c9mile Durkheim, a sociologist, in the late 1800s. The term \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d refers to a set of shared morals, ideas, or beliefs that unify a group of people in some way. Similarly to groupthink, collective consciousness is not presented as inherently good or evil, and the benefits and drawbacks of collective consciousness can depend on the situation. Whether or not it is harmful depends on the unifying idea or moral. Much like with groupthink, if the idea is one that is oppressive and institutionalized, it can cause harm to the specific group that the idea in question targets. However, if the belief is beneficial, it could allow humanity to become more advanced in a number of ways. Although groupthink has some similarities to collective consciousness, Harari\u2019s belief that individuality is a myth directly contradicts concepts that were discussed very early on in the semester, specifically the ideas originated by William James, Charles Horton Cooley, and George Herbert Mead, which were discussed in Module 2. William James proposed that an individual\u2019s identity can be divided into three parts, including the spiritual, social, and material self. Charles Horton Cooley argued a similar point, putting forward that people have a \u201clooking glass\u201d self, in which people change the way that they behave based on how others perceive them. Finally, George Herbert Mead, similarly to James, suggests that a person\u2019s identity is split into three parts, those being the Self, the I, and the Me. Although these three people present different interpretations of identity, they share one thing in common. They all believe that people are individuals, with different views of the world around them, and that their identities are multifaceted. However, Harari argues that because humans rarely, if ever, think as individuals, and only really think as a group, and it is because of this that individuality is a myth. The tension between these two arguments comes from their core components. Both of these arguments can be applied to many different situations, and not all of them will contradict each other. However, the argument of whether or not people can be individuals is what creates the conflict between these points. I don\u2019t think that any one person in this argument is right or wrong. As I said before, any of these concepts could be applied to many different sets of circumstances. I think that both arguments make good points, and have validity. How applicable the argument is just depends on the situation.\nIn the chapter \u201cNationalism\u201d, Harari discusses many aspects of nationalism. Nationalism is defined as having extreme loyalty and devotion to one\u2019s own nation, usually to the extent of looking down upon other nations. People who are nationalists tend to look down upon other cultures, as they consider theirs to be the \u201cright one\u201d. When faced with other cultures or beliefs, nationalists may react negatively or aggressively. Harari describes how these behaviors start to occur, talking about how \u201cbenign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultranationalism. Instead of believing that my nation is unique - which is true of all nations - I might begin feeling that my nation is supreme, that I owe it my entire loyalty, and that I have no significant obligations to anyone else'' (Harari, 112). This way of thinking is described further in the chapter \u201cImmigration\u201d. Harari describes how \u201cthough globalization has greatly reduced cultural differences across the planet, it has simultaneously made it far easier to encounter strangers and become upset by their oddities\u201d (Harari, 140). Nationalists that view others in this way may feel like they don\u2019t need to respect other cultures or people different from them. They see these people as beneath them, and feel no obligation to treat them with much consideration. This way of thinking is complimentary of racism. Extreme nationalism shares many similarities with racism, and can often be the source of racism. Earlier in the semester, racism and the different ways it can manifest were discussed, especially in module 4, where job discrimination was discussed. A key example of job discrimination can be found with the Pager discriminaiton study. The study was performed by Devah Pager and Bart Bonikowski, both from Princeton University, as well as Bruce Western from Harvard University. This study addressed the question of how racial discrimination impacts the job market. The study involved a number of job applicants, all men between the ages of 22 and 26. All of the applicants presented themselves as being of the same education level, and having equal job experience. The applicants were all either Black, White, or Latino. Some of the applicants were instructed to disclose a criminal record when asked. The results show just how widespread job discriminaiton is. Among the group that included participants that didn\u2019t have a criminal record, the white applicants had the most positive responses, with 31% of the callbacks. Latino applicants followed with 25.2% of the positive responses, and Black people had 15.2% of the positive responses. This part of the study shows how race can have an impact on the job application process. In the group that included participants who were given a criminal record, white applicants still had the highest amount of positive responses, with 17.2% of the job offers. Latino and Black participants followed with 15.4% and 13% of the positive responses respectively. Overall, this study shows that, even though progress has been made, racial discriminaiton, especially in regards to job applications, is still very much alive. The act of judging someone based on something like their race or culture is what connects job discrimination and extreme nationalism. People who participate in extreme nationalism believe that those who are different from them are less deserving of certain opportunities or rights. When an interviewer turns down an applicant based on their race, similarly to extreme nationalists, it shows that they believe that people of a certain race are less deserving of the opportunities that other people get. \nThe Pager discrimination study also has similarities to another topic covered by Harari in the \u201cEquality\u201d chapter of his book. In this chapter, the topic of economic disparities and class discrimination are covered. Similarly, the Pager discrimination study deals with the economic effects of racism. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the history of inequality is discussed. Harari describes how economic inequality can date back to the Stone Age, and talks about how some members of hunter-gatherer communities were buried with expensive jewelry and clothing, and others were buried with nothing at all. Even back then, people\u2019s status depended on their wealth. Harari also mentions that throughout history wealth is the only thing that determines high social status, and that \u201cthroughout history the rich and the aristocracy always imagined that they had skills superior to everybody else\u2019s, which was why they were in control. As far as we can tell, that wasn\u2019t true\u201d (Harari, 75). The Pager discrimination is almost like a continuation of this chapter. It shows how economic inequality has persisted into the modern day, and the ways in which it manifests. \nIn conclusion, Harari\u2019s book covers many topics that both complement and contradict topics that have been covered in the past in this class. These topics include the comparison of economic disparity in the past and modern day, the similarities between extreme nationalism and racial discrimination, and the similarities and differences between the collective consciousness, the different \u201cselves\u201d that make up a person\u2019s identity, and individuality being a myth. Having many different perspectives on an issue is important, which is why it\u2019s essential to think critically about people\u2019s opinions. Having different views on a topic is one thing among many that makes our experiences unique.\nSOURCES\nHarari, Yuval N. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. Spiegel & Grau, 2018. \nPager, Devah, et al.

        "text": "SOC-105\n\nWhen I was in my senior year of high school I had an open spot in my schedule, I did not have to take a math class which I was incredibly happy about but then I was tasked with the decision of filling a spot I wished I could have just left empty. I was dreading choosing a class until I came upon a weight training class, I was ecstatic! I had been working out for a while at that point but I did not belong to a gym and did not own any home weights and I liked the idea of getting my work out over with during school hours so I wouldn't have to worry about it when I got home when I was already worried about getting homework done and spending time with my friends and other chores I had to get done around the house. I knew I was not going to go in there and lift super heavy, but I was a little disappointed that to start with I could only lift the bar. I could often hear other classmates laughing at me as I did my sets and making jokes about it being pointless for me to even try and some of the guys would say I was taking up their time to lift. I was the only girl in the class. I told them I was a beginner, and I knew I could not lift much weight, but I told them that I truly wanted to improve and get stronger and more muscular and that I did not take the class to joke around, waste their time or take up their workout time, I truly wanted to become good at weight lifting. Nobody seemed to care that I had good intentions. I am considered to be quite petite so I was judged even before they saw I could only lift the bar. We were all paired as two-person partner groups. My partner seemed very upset to be paired with me and he would talk to the other guys in class but then when it was time for us to lift weights together he would put in his AirPods and refuse to talk to me and was very reluctant to take out his earbuds when I was waving at him to get his attention which I rarely did only if needed. One day in class I was lifting the bar for a bench press when he spotted me and I was struggling, it was obvious I needed his help lifting the bar back onto the rack, I said:  \u201cI cannot get it, can you help?\u201d He looked me straight in the eyes and saw me struggling and refused to help me lift it onto the rack, I dropped it on my chest, and it rolled down my ribcage onto my stomach. I always felt like an outsider in that class, it was although they all had a supportive and healthily competitive community, and I was the \u201cother.\u201d Around this time, I started seeing videos of female weightlifters on social media, I was envious of their bodies, and it made me feel even worse that I could not lift anywhere close to what they could. It very negatively affected my self-esteem and my relationship with food and my body image. \nDe Beauvoir described women as being categorized as the other as society viewing women as weak and as an incomplete man whose body has no meaning without being in reference to a man\u2019s body. Society deemed women and their attributes to be non-essential and different than the majority and therefore did not belong. Men were deemed the sovereign of society. A woman's body is then seen as an object rather than a useful human being with potential. Women are judged by their anatomy and are accused of acting certain ways because of their hormones, women as the other are seen as obstacles for men. De Beauvoir says women are called \u201cthe sex\u201d and that men see her essentially as a sexed being and that is all. De Beauvoir says women are inessential in front of the essential, men are the subject, the absolute and women are the other. Women are not a minority in the traditional sense there are equal number of men and women on Earth, however, women are treated as a minority and as weak incomplete beings that are meant to be tools or playthings for men. We as women are outsiders in our own society. Women have always been seen as subordinates to men. Women are designated as the other by men who posited themselves as the one or the subject.\nThe weight training class I took was certainly a hegemonic masculinity environment and, in my situation, it was damaging. Hegemonic masculinity encourages men to act hyper-masculine and shuns those who do not fit that mold. This encourages men to be \u201cmanly men.\u201d Hegemonic masculinity is meant to legitimize men as the dominant force in society and that men are dominant over women.\nThe most obvious way I was blatantly put into the category as other and was made to feel as though I did not belong was one day, we had a substitute in class, he looked me up and down and his face twisted with annoyance and disgust, and he asked me \u201c do you even lift anything in here?\u201d I felt truly angry and isolated. I kept getting the same message that I was the other and I was in everyone else's way. The message that I was weak, and incomplete was repetitively sent to me in different ways. The boys in my class and the substitute teacher supported treating women as other and a hegemonic masculine environment.\nWomen are often excluded or judged in male dominated sports. I experienced this treatment firsthand in the weight training class I took. The way my other classmates treated me and the way the substitute teacher spoke to me supported a hegemonic masculinity environment where I was made to feel like I did not belong, and I was made to feel like I was weak, not capable of improvement. Everyone should make efforts to disrupt and dismantle this system of treating women as the other and it should be known that hegemonic masculinity is not okay. I should have stood up to my classmates and the substitute teacher or even reported the rude comment he made to me to someone of a higher position at the school. Men should give women equal opportunity and be patient and accepting when they themselves are also looking to improve. Allowing women into male sports and maybe doing away with a separation between sports such as the WNBA and NBA may be a viable solution as well. I lift weights with my husband, and I also occasionally lift weights with one of our male mutual friends and neither of them judge me and they are both incredibly supportive during our workouts, so I know it is possible for men to not be toxic towards women in the gym. I would urge everyone not to play into or accept hegemonic masculinity as okay and to treat women as equals rather than subordinates or the other. \n\nWork Cited \nBeauvoir, S. de. (2015).

        "text": "Despair and Hope\n\tThe ideas that people have about terroism and the presence of terrorists is very different from the actual presence of terorism and terrorists. Terorims is a mind game played by terrorists in such a way that they can do absolutely nothing but their mere presence is enough to instill massive amounts of fear and worry. The idea of what they are doing on the outside and what everyone can see versus what they are doing behind the scenes is similar to a \u201cfrontstage and backstage\u201d outlook about the presentation of the self. What terrorism does without activly doing anything is very similar to how humans present themselves to the world. \n\tThe ideas of a front stage and a backstage can really be applied to any human being and any social situation. The specific instance of terrorism is a great example of this because the entire idea of terrorism is the idea that they are playing a role for everyone to see. Goffman created his ideas about the presentation of the self specifically talking about human beings but like most things in life, it is a simple property or theory that can be applied to many different mediums.

        "text": "\nThe issue of alienation is more significant in today's world. Workers feel disconnected from their work, products, colleagues, and even themselves due to the way production works under capitalism. This disconnection leads to feelings of powerlessness, estrangement, and a sense of being removed from society. Moreover, this feeling extends beyond economics to affect cultural aspects, contributing to a sense of being culturally adrift and losing one's identity in an increasingly globalized society. Technology plays a role in intensifying feelings of alienation today. While technology has connected people from all over the world, it has also caused division and loneliness. People may get lost in worlds and lose touch with the natural world, leading to feelings of detachment and alienation from reality.\nApart from alienation, social alienation is also widespread nowadays. Social media platforms may seem like they bring people together, but they often result in relationships that deepen feelings of loneliness and isolation. There can be pressure on individuals to present an image online, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and disconnect from human interactions. While Domhoff's theory, Marx's idea of commodity fetishism, and the concept of alienation offer insights, they come with some limitations. Domhoff's theory might not fully acknowledge the role of individuals and social movements in challenging power structures. Critics argue that Marx's focus on commodity fetishism is too narrow, overlooking forms of oppression like those based on gender and race. Moreover, while the idea of alienation is impactful, it may not completely capture the complexities of today's socio landscape, calling for a nuanced analysis of social relationships.\nIn summary, Domhoffs power elite theory, Marx's concept of commodity fetishism, and the notion of alienation serve as frameworks for understanding society. By applying these perspectives to real-world scenarios, scholars and activists can deepen their insights into issues like power dynamics, exploitation, and feelings of estrangement. However, it is crucial to approach these concepts and acknowledge their limitations to develop sophisticated analyses of contemporary socio-economic realities.\n\nWhen exploring the concept of alienation in today\u2019s world, it is worth considering whether all professions involve some level of detachment. According to Marx, alienation refers to individuals feeling disconnected from the fruits of their labor, their colleagues, at work, and even themselves. In the realm of work, this feeling of alienation shows itself in forms, adding to an issue of disconnection within society.\nModern work often involves tasks and specialized roles, which can result in a feeling of monotony and detachment from the work itself. In fields, workers might find themselves doing tasks without fully grasping how their efforts contribute to the final product or service. This lack of understanding can breed feelings of alienation and disinterest.\nAdditionally, the hierarchical setup in workplaces can worsen this sense of alienation among employees. In these structures, decision-making power tends to be concentrated at the top, leaving lower-level employees with little autonomy and control over their tasks. This power disparity can lead to a feeling of helplessness and alienation among workers who feel cut off from decision-making processes that impact their daily work lives. Furthermore, the increase in employment situations like contracts and gig jobs has added to feelings of alienation in today's workforce. Precarious workers often lack job security, benefits, and chances for career growth, creating a sense of instability and uncertainty. The uncertainty in job security can make workers feel disconnected, trying to find stability and a sense of belonging at work.\nTechnology's widespread presence at work also contributes to employees feeling detached. While technology has made work more efficient, it has also increased isolation among workers. Virtual communication tools and remote work setups can hinder interactions, leading to loneliness and detachment from coworkers. Moreover, how labor is treated as a commodity under capitalism makes workers feel alienated from their work results. In a system, labor is viewed as something to be bought and sold rather than a form of self-expression or satisfaction. This commodification can lead to workers feeling dehumanized and objectified, reduced to cogs in the production wheel.\nIn summary, alienation seeps into aspects of work life and contributes to a broader sense of disconnection in society. Many employees experience alienation in their jobs due to tasks, hierarchical workplace structures, precarious job conditions, or technological impacts. By acknowledging and dealing with these types of disconnection, we can strive to establish work settings that are more satisfying and purposeful for everyone.",

        "text": "The Matrix of Domination\n\tThe Matrix of Domination is a symbolic order and used to show or determine something in society. A simple example could be an old, white, male using statistics and data to prove his points and support his arguments on equality. What this matrix really means is that in all categories of society and life, there is going to be a ranking of these groups where one is seen as superior to the rest. The Matrix of Domination can be seen in gender roles as through history people have fought for the matrix to shift but its reality has not wavered. \n\tWhen thinking about gender roles in society as it pertains to the matrix of domination, Simone de Beauvoir does a really good job explaining this hierarchy between men and women. She explained that men were seen as the \u201csubject and absolute\u201d and that women were the supporting characters for whatever a man may need. Women were not treated as equal and did not have the same status as men, so much so that they were compared to African Americans and Jews, as far as how society saw them. This is where we can see the matrix because it is very obvious that in the category of gender the matrix put men first and women second, as men had all the power over women. \n\tThe matrix of domination is a hierarchy within a societal category where one group in this category is going to have supreme power over the other groups. In the matrix of gender the group that has this overarching power of the rest is men, and their power extends over women. How this matrix is going to be seen to society is that men are granted more roles, more opportunities, greater salaries, etc. simply because, compared to their female counterparts, they are a man and therefore seen as superior. In this society everyone just expects women to go along with this idea because it is the way things have always been so things will stay this way, and do to people thinking this way, the matrix is just enforced that much more. \n\tThe Matrix of Domination is the symbolic order and intersection used to show or determine something in a society. What this matrix means is that in many categories of life and society, there is going to be a hierarchy within these groups where one is seen as superior to the rest. The Matrix of Domination as seen in gender roles has shown little change in history because this idea that men are above women is all that most people have known. The Matrix of Domination has heavily impacted the flow of society for a long time, most prevalently in categories like gender, race, religion, and social class. \n",

        "text": "The Technological Challenge\n\tIn twenty-first century America, equality is something that is seen as a luxury and it is something that has separated us from other countries. The reality is that for the past few decades we are constantly being told about the great strides made toward equality, but when you look at the big picture of America, it is far from equal. One of the largest gaps of equality in twenty-first century America is between the economic classes, which can also be referred to as the rift between rich and poor. Economic equality does not exist in America and the class system is so one sided that it is possible to be looked at as a hierarchy. The economic hierarchy in twenty-first century America can be heavily related to beliefs about the existence of a \u201cPower Elite\u201d in America. \n\tHarari\u2019s ideas about the 1% and Domhoff\u2019s ideas on the \u201cPower Elite\u201d can come together and represent what this economic hierarchy is. The 1% and the \u201cPower Elite\u201d would be at the top of your hierarchy like a king and in this role they are governing over and making decisions for the people in the levels below them. When taking these two ideas into considerations there is no possible way to see twenty-first century America as equal, specifically in the economic sense. A society cannot be equal if there is one small group ruling over another group, especially not when the margin between these two groups is as wide as it is. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105\n5/2/2022\nOvercoming the Urge to Reracialize by Building a Multicultural Community\nHow can a non-white immigrant to the United States fit in? I was born in Lebanon and moved to the United States when I was four years old, and thus I had the experience of trying to acclimate to a change in culture coupled with the attempt to make friends and fit in at school. My desire to fit in led to embarrassment concerning various aspects of myself and my life, including my skin color and my last name, which is difficult to pronounce. Furthermore, I ended up placing myself within the racial hierarchy which is in place in the U.S, striving to be considered white as a way to feel accepted. However, as I grew older, I was fortunate enough to find friends from other cultures who inspired me and gave me the courage I needed to be myself. Overall, for a non-white immigrant moving to the U.S, befriending people from other cultures is critical to oppose the pressure to place oneself and others within a racial hierarchy.\nBeing an only child and a relatively insecure one at that, I felt desperate to fit in and to be liked. Through my attempts to do so, I found myself attempting to repress my culture as much as possible and I tried to avoid standing out because I did not want to be labeled as \u201cother\u201d. As a consequence, I felt embarrassed about various aspects of myself. For instance, I would get uncomfortable when waiters at restaurants could not understand what my parents said due to their accent. Furthermore, I would wince when thinking of people struggling to pronounce my last name at awards ceremonies and when teachers would ask me to pronounce my last name. Now, I try to say it in the easiest way possible for Americans to pronounce, even though this is not how I would pronounce it in Arabic. Moreover, after moving to the U.S, I would visit Lebanon once or twice a year. In order to make the trip worthwhile over Christmas break, I would skip a few days of class and as such would be asked to make an educational presentation on my trip to Lebanon to share with the class when I returned. This would also lead to embarrassment because I was the only person in class who did such presentations. \nAfter the tenth grade, I went to the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM), which had a far greater level of diversity and which had several multicultural events occurring throughout my time there. At NCSSM, I was not as worried about standing out because there were lots of my peers from different cultures. \nTom\u00e1s Almaguer described the process of the reracialization of Latino populations in the United States. Reracialization is when a group fuses the racial divisions and hierarchies of  their country of origin with those of the country they immigrated to; each group will position itself in relation to the other in the newly formed racial hierarchy. For example, a white immigrant from Iceland might conduct reracialization upon arriving in the U.S, thus positioning themselves higher up in the racial hierarchy than a black immigrant from Kenya. \n I have been told that I appear ethnically ambiguous and have observed that my physical appearance and skin color are similar to those of people from various parts of the world. Moreover, I have been mistaken for a Hispanic person on multiple occasions by Hispanics. When I was little, I wished that I had a lighter skin tone so that I would appear to be more white. I thought that I was \u201calmost\u201d white. In the summer, I would be saddened by the fact that my skin would get darker, pushing me further away from the race I wanted to be. Thus, after I moved to the U.S., I began the process of reracialization, not only of the people I met but of myself as well. In Lebanon, race was not something I thought of because most people looked like me. Here, there is a clear racial hierarchy which pervades media and social interactions in both subtle and striking ways, placing white people on top and black people on the bottom. When growing up, I had friends, the majority of whom were white; this was due to the fact that my school was predominantly white and that I held stereotypes about the black students, which led me to avoid attempting to start friendships with them. Maybe I wanted to be accepted by white people to feed into my hope of being perceived as white. Nowadays, I feel more comfortable spending time with people who are from other cultures. Somehow, I feel closer to them than to white people because it is like we are in the same boat. We have parallel experiences which, even though they are not identical, serve to bring us closer. At UNCW, I have been fortunate enough to join multicultural clubs and to meet people who have immigrated to the U.S like I did. Forming close ties and bonds with people from other cultures is an effective way to oppose the strong pressure to reracialize the self and others. Even though my friends are not Lebanese, the fact that they are not afraid to be a race other than white gives me the courage to accept myself as being different and yet still feel like I fit in. Arguably, the inverse is true as well. Even if there is no ill will or intent to exclude amongst the majority in a population, people in the minority will end up feeling pressure to reracialize according to the racial hierarchy unless they are able to form bonds with other minority members. \nAt NCSSM, I went to several multicultural events, allowing me to learn more about the cultures of which my peers were a part and to have fun doing so by eating food, listening to music, and playing games which came from those cultures. Comparing NCSSM to my previous high school, Gray\u2019s Creek High School (GCHS), I can see stark differences in the amount of pressure I felt to place myself within a racial hierarchy. At GCHS, since most people were white and the second largest group was black, I felt drawn to the former because I looked more white than black and because of the pre-existing racial hierarchy. Thus, my internalized reracialization drove which groups of people I ended up spending time with, who I wanted to be friends with, who I had a crush on, and how I would approach interactions with various people and myself. On the other hand, at NCSSM, the culturally diverse environment served to counter my urge to reracialize because it reduced my need to be associated with the majority racial group in order to fit in. I was able to fit in by just being myself despite the fact that none of my friends were Lebanese or even Arabic. Simply knowing that my friends were not the majority meant that I felt a sense of shared experience with them and thus I grew strong bonds with them through empathy. \nIn conclusion, reracialization in immigrants is spurred by the pervasive pre-existing racial hierarchy in the U.S, yet it can be opposed through the formation of connections among people of various minorities. Becoming friends with people who are from different cultures can help immigrants reduce the power of racial stereotyping and can help them fit in despite the fact that they are a minority. Moreover, having an environment where various cultures are constantly being celebrated and represented can help immigrants feel more comfortable about their own culture, even if their culture is not being celebrated directly. This works because people from minority groups face similar difficulties in their daily lives and can thus relate to one another and empathize despite not being from the same culture. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105 \u2013 2nd Reflection Essay\nNovember 29th, 2021\nYuval Harari vs. Sociology \nIn this reflection essay, my goal is to compare Yuval Harari\u2019s arguments in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to sociological topics from this course. In a broad sense, Harari has similar perspectives to many sociology points mentioned previously in this class, but this essay will serve as a more detailed synthesis of two differing perspectives. While Harari focuses on the 21st century and the lessons of history we should head advice from, much of sociology reveals lessons and understandings of human behavior from the past that are still relevant today. Yuval Harari is a historian and philosopher who forms his arguments to convey that type of perspective, while sociology describes  social relationships and human behavior in relation to those historical perspectives. In Yuval Harari\u2019s book, Chapter 6\u2019s lesson is about civilization in which he talks about community, culture, and religion in relation to historical and geographical perspectives. Going forward, I will compare this chapter to sociological perspectives on similar topics from module 1 such as \u201cThe Neurology of Religion\u201d by Maryanski and Turner, \u201cMicrofoundations\u201d by Fligstein and MacAdams, and \u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation\u201d by Durkheim.\n\tIn module 1, \u201cThe Neurology of Religion\u201d by Maryanski and Turner describes religion not by what each individual religion believes, but rather the mechanisms that are behind the formation of religion in humans. Maryanski and Turner\u2019s perspective comes from an evolutionary standpoint, where they identified reasons for religious expansion through diving back in history to when humans had the brain capacity for religion but did not yet collectively believe. The authors argue against recent tendencies to view religion as simple neurological forces, and instead explain religion to be a complex compilation of many driving factors. Religion does not happen because humans have a \u201cGod gene\u201d or cognitive \u201cnodules\u201d in the brain to enable their capacity for religious belief. Religion may partially be caused by neurology like that, but those perspectives leave out the evolutionary reasons for religion that formed from the evolution of neurology along with cognitive and emotional dynamics. According to Maryanski and Turner, religion itself is not just belief in the supernatural; it is communities of individuals with shared beliefs of sacred and supernatural powers, engaging in emotional rituals, and organizing those rituals within social structures in the community. Religion evolved while ancient humans evolved the capacity to believe in the supernatural. No other species on Earth has the capacity for collective religious belief and that ultimately stems from human consciousness and human\u2019s capacity to maintain social connections. Maryanski and Turner illustrate the importance of behavioral adaptations, such as stronger social groupings, that has allowed religion to have longevity in human societies.\n\u201cMicrofoundations\u201d by Fligstein and MacAdams talks about rational choice theory and the social behavior of humans compared to other primates. Humans have the capacity for abstract thought, which distinguishes them from other primates such as chimpanzees or gorillas. Humans can make things meaningful but can also make things seem meaningless. This reason explains what Fligstein and MacAdams mean when they describe human abstract thought as \u201cdouble-edged.\u201d Just as humans can find inspiration and assign meaning to our goals and achievements, we can also doubt that our lives have any meaning at all. This distinguishes us from other primates who follow their social structure and follow their natural instincts rather than draw inspiration from abstract thought. Fligstein and MacAdams coined the phrase \u201cthe existential function of the social.\u201d According to them, the social (or society) provides coordinated, meaningful activity; allowing us to collectively make each other\u2019s lives meaningful (or meaningless). Behavioral evolution of the human species around 45,000 years ago created the kind of humans we see today. During this time, humans developed various sorts of communication that were beneficial to survival such as language, art, and burial traditions. Humans had the capacity to do this before, but through collective meaning making projects, we began to evolve into more social creatures who assigned symbolic reality to have true meaning.\n\u201cThe Cultural Logic of Collective Representation\u201d by Durkheim illustrates the importance of religion in society. It is important to study religion in society, according to Durkheim, because shared beliefs and religions shape different societies and cultures. \u201cCollective effervescence\u201d refers to feeling together in society. Society and community are therefore the fundamental principles of religion. \u201cCollective representations\u201d are symbols, artifacts, or narratives that embody the collective beliefs and values of a group. Although these are not always religious, they certainly can be. For example, a nation\u2019s flag is an example of a collective representation, and the ideals and values of the flag establishes some type of community. These representations are how collective consciousness manifests in society. Durkheim believes that collective ideals provide us with truth and stability. With joint individual effort and understanding, comes collective rationality and truth. Individual thoughts and experiences are variable, but when collective thought was introduced to society, impersonal thought was also unveiled. This change in human consciousness allowed for new understanding of situations and perspectives that they could have never known without communication and collective thought. This created morality in society.\n\tYuval Harari speaks of religion and culture from a philosophical and historical context. For example, he mentions Orthodox Jews of today and how they refrain from images and depictions of women and girls in society and often segregate them from men and boys in their sacred spaces. Harari argues that this is a fault of some religions and cultures, because instead of adapting their collective beliefs to be inclusive in today\u2019s standards, they uphold outdated standards from history that are not entirely accurate. According to some Orthodox Jews of today\u2019s standards, the Jews in early Israeli history (who did not segregate people based on gender) would be blasphemous and disrespectful to their [ancient] culture\u2026 that they consider themselves to be a part of. This illustrates a blatant disregard to the cultural changes of human society that were for the better. According to Harari, humans have social systems, but they are not genetically determined. Chimpanzees and gorillas also have distinct social structures, but unlike humans, those are genetically determined. Gorillas cannot decide to behave socially as chimpanzees do, and chimpanzees cannot decide to adopt the social structure of gorillas. Both animals have the capacity for intelligent thought, but they lack the consciousness and group communication that humans have. If humans wanted to behave in social structures like chimpanzees or gorillas, we could observe the behavior of the animals and collectively communicate how we wanted to behave. Those animals are limited to their own neurology, and since humans are a more complex species, we have evolved from our ancient ancestors to behave completely different than in the past. Humans are one species but have many different cultures, beliefs, and social identifiers. People around the world speak different languages, believe in different supernatural powers, and learn from different historical outcomes. Human structures and religions constantly change, because humans can look at the recorded past and make adequate changes for the future. Other animals do not have the same cognitive abilities.\nWhile Harari analyzes human behavior and achievement throughout history, the sociological perspectives mentioned previously find the root of that behavior and achievement. Harari criticizes human history to make a more inclusive tomorrow, while Maryanski and Turner, Fligstein and MacAdams, and Durkheim all explain the fundamental reasons for the behaviors. Harari sees the flaws of humans and points the readers in the moral right direction to correct those mistakes. Just as Fligstein and MacAdams describe abstract thought as \u201cdouble-edged,\u201d Harari reaffirms this belief in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. Fligstein and MacAdams focus on the collective meaningful developments of humans, while Harari focuses on the contrary beliefs and the negative impacts that come from meaningless thought. Regarding religion, Harari focuses on the negatives of religion and what that conveys to society, while Maryanski and Turner focus on what led to the development of religion and what has kept religion in society. Both texts talk about the causes and effects of religion on humans, but Harari focuses on the growth that society can have, without disregarding the importance of religion. Regarding Durkheim and collective representations, Harari similarly finds the importance of collective beliefs on truth and stability. What differs between the two texts is which side of truth they are on. Durkheim reiterates how collective ideals lead to clearer beliefs in society, while Harari illustrates how collective ideals can be harmful to the overall society if not everyone shares the ideals. \nIn modern society it is hard to have collective beliefs that align with everyone, but upholding beneficial beliefs is important for the future. Yuval Harari\u2019s text combines many cultures, just as our nations of today do. The sociological ideas talked about previously mostly refer to general human behavior of the past and how that affects us today, but Yuval Harari\u2019s specific lessons for the 21st century tie history with how we want society to look in the future. Just as Harari listed many lessons for us to learn from, we can equally learn from sociological perspectives of the past. Collectively, humans need to take Harari\u2019s lessons and combine them with the sociological lessons from the past, to accurately understand how history continues to affect civilization today. ",

        "text": "4684\nThe sociability of humans is at the center of Mead's ideas on the self. He proposes that the self is not something innate or predetermined, but emerges through social interaction. One of Mead\u2019s many contributions to social psychology is his concept of the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cme.\u201d Mead refers to these two states as phases of the self. This distinction highlights the mutual exchange between individual agency and social influence in the construction of the self. There are times when the \u201cI\u201d emerges and creates new responses that do not align with the \u201cMe\u201d that has been created. The intersection of these two states occurs through reflection. \n\u201cI\u201d represents the spontaneous and creative aspect of the self. The \u201cI\u201d reflects the self as a subject of experiences. Mead describes the \u201cI\u201d as being a response to the \u201cMe\u201d. \u201cI\u201d is not immediately aware of itself. Imagine you\u2019re at a dinner party with colleagues. As you engage in conversation with one of your work friends, they remind you of a funny memory. This causes you to feel the uncontrollable urge to laugh out loud. This is an example of the \u201cI\u201d taking precedence. You momentarily lose awareness of the social norms dictating that setting and express yourself without regard for external expectations. \nWe can describe the \"Me\" as the objective that we experience when we reflect on our actions. While you were at that dinner party laughing loudly, you suddenly engaged in your \u201cMe\u201d aspect. You remembered the context of the social situation and regained your composure. You become aware of what is expected of you and make the conscious decision to suppress the urge to laugh, aligning your behavior with societal norms. \u201cMe\u201d is not a static state. It is a phase of your existence that is constantly transforming. \nWilliam James, an American philosopher, produced work that contributed to the understanding of the self in a social context. Similarly to Mead, James separates the self into \u201cMe\u201d and \u201cI\u201d. However, James argues that the \u201cMe\u201d can be divided into subcategories- the social self, the material self, and the spiritual self. The division of the self into these categories supports both James\u2019 and Mead\u2019s claim that human identity is multifaceted and influenced by one\u2019s environment and personal thoughts.  \nThe social self is the aspect of the self that relates to an individual\u2019s identity with others. The social self is shaped by social interaction and the roles expected in society. For James, people act based on who they are with. For example, a person may have an entirely different personality at work than the personality they have at home with their family.\nThe material self relates to the physical body, possessions, and the immediate environment that surrounds someone. The possessions that compose someone's material self are tied to their identity. Things like the body, family, clothing, wealth, and other tangible possessions constitute the material self. According to James, the cornerstone of the material self rests upon the physical body. Following the body, attire holds significance. He claims that clothing serves as a way for individuals to express their perceived identity or social status, thereby contributing to the creating and maintaining one\u2019s self-image. Furthermore, money and family play pivotal roles in the material self. The loss of a family member often results in a corresponding loss of one\u2019s identity. A substantial financial loss could prompt a fundamental shift in an individual\u2019s sense of self. Cell phones have grown to become large parts of a material identity. There is a large dependency on cell phones, as they have become indispensable tools for sociality. Individuals rely on their phones to stay connected with others. \nThe spiritual self is the innermost core of a person\u2019s existence. Thoughts, feelings, and consciousness make up this state of being. The spiritual self represents one\u2019s unique identity beyond their physical and social dimensions. The spiritual self motivates reactions. Reactions are based on emotions, thoughts, and intentions. The spiritual self includes introspection and looking inward. The religious self is used to explore profound spiritual, moral, or intellectual questions free from the influence of others.\nJames and Mead propose that developing the self is not entirely an individual process. Both share common ground in their emphasis on the social nature of identity formation and the dynamic interplay between individuals and their social environments. The self relies heavily on social interactions. We are aware of this because of the large contributions James and Mead made to sociology. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105\n26 February 2021\nMatrix of Domination: Gender\nMen are considered to have preeminence over relationships, home-life, and occupations in society today. However, since this is the social speculation of men, it brings the idea of unfairness and oppression towards women behind it. As shown in Gilman\u2019s The Yellow Wallpaper, men have controlled her life and explain how men control the nation\u2019s economic standards. The authority that men use over women which society derives from the norms of superiority form a component in the Matrix of Domination, which symbolizes the oppression women face based on men\u2019s dominance. \n\tGilman displays her story in her article of The Yellow Wallpaper, which entails her being told that she is not sick or ill when she believes otherwise. But since her husband and brother were doctors and male, she did not have the personal decision on her well-being. She later talks about how men rule over the economic income in families, and that women\u2019s only duties are to take care of the family, where the man is the working character. This shows the overwhelming side of women being oppressed by men in society, and how the norms are restricting women to exercise their rights to be human. Women are being bound to the house and taking care of kids every single day just to please the husband, just because of society\u2019s rationale of the Matrix of Domination. \n\tThe Matrix of Domination, written by Patricia Collins, describes the complete meaning of what the Matrix of Domination is. The Matrix of Domination is the components of gender, race, ethnicity, environment, age, and many more that show the correlation of the oppressed and the oppressors according to society. Even with the Matrix, the oppression develops a way to resist the dominance, like stated by Collins, the oppressed group finds ways of empowerment to reject the dimensions of knowledge of the system of oppression. This means that with empowerment, groups of oppressed people will create new value for themselves, new images of themselves, and new restrictions that pertain to their likings. This shows that the Matrix of Dominations models who is superior and whom do they oppress, but the people of oppression have capabilities to counteract the social perception put on them from the people of dominance.  \n\tIn conclusion, the Matrix of Domination symbolizes the meaning behind the Yellow Wallpaper, where women are less dominant compared to men, so women are being oppressed by men because they are controlled physically, emotionally, and economically by them. The Matrix of Domination does not just pertain to gender, but also race, ethnicity, and other socially specific things. Race is something that people of color get oppressed every day and needs to be more universally known to society so we can lessen the effects of oppression with knowledge of the issue and empowerment of all the oppressed races. \n",

        "text": "SOC 105 \nJanuary 29, 2021\nCollective Consciousness\nCommunity is something that can create influential order and make certain ideas powerful if it has the right amount of affinity behind it. For instance, the social norms of today's world are based on the collective consciousness, which is the shared ideology or reality of a community. Collective consciousness is formed by manifesting certain ideas through rituals or certain repeated human cooperation and can be examples of art, symbols, artifacts, or narratives of cultural beliefs. The idea of collective consciousness is the rooted basis of almost all social norms today, but it what is the origin of this manifested ideology and how influential is it.  \nCollective consciousness has been around since the era of Neanderthals, and according to Fligstein and MacAdams, Microfoundations, sociologists used the collective aspect for survival from Neanderthal's one of the earliest fundamental concepts of collective consciousness. The Neanderthals created tools and art which symbolized evolutionary development and coordinated symbolic activities. The idea of collective consciousness also is shown to be the representation of religions and folklore. As Durkheim describes in The Cultural Logic of Collective Representations, religious origins are the motive for the fundamental categories of thought and therefore science. Religion is essentially the main example of the collective consciousness because religion itself is a system of beliefs for people with common values to practice similar experiences. Religion has an influential capability in today\u2019s society, however, the power of lore is also just prominent. In the podcast Black Stockings by Aaron Mahnke, he states that the power of fear or the unknown is very powerful and uses the Lore of the Irish legend \u201cchangelings\u201d as an example. Aaron Mahnke explains how this lore of changelings plagued the Irish\u2019s mind so severely that they would burn babies, kill, and do inhumane rituals based on superstitions of changelings. This shows the extraordinary measure collective consciousness can accomplish.  \nEverything today's society believes in or does is originally the conspectus of collective consciousness and has impacted humanity throughout history. From the collaborative effort of the Neanderthals to religions to folklore, collective consciousness in its nature influences everything we know today. It forms the social norms that we believe in and the way people teach things, and it explains why community is so influential.",

        "text": "SOC 105\nChristpher Elliot\n12 February 2021\nGender Inequality at its Finest\nThe world today is plagued with social norms that are against women. For example, the collective consciousness norm that women must look pretty, as summarized in Naomi Wolf\u2019s Beauty Myth. Women have been judged on the way they looked, and have been told by men how to act, what to wear, and what to think. It is important to understand the subjective ideology that follows women\u2019s history so we can learn and help change the roles they are supposed to be, and so we can see the consequences that follow the social roles.  \nIn the Yellow Wallpaper, by Gilman, she encapsulates the story of a woman getting told by her husband and brother that nothing is wrong with her when she develops this mental ailment. This is an example of how men, have a social superiority over women on how they are supposed to think. She is driven crazy because she is cannot make her own choices or thoughts and she slowly drown in her inner thoughts which was the ultimate consequence. Men also have control over how women are believed to look. In Beauty Myth, Wolf states that women have been made to believe that \u201cbeauty\u201d is something valuable which is the highest social factor for them, and that the power lies in how pretty, skinny, or sexually attractive they are. The results from these social norms caused thirty-three thousand women in the past decade to want to achieve weight loss and caused pornography to rise double. These consequences conclusively resulted in other norms that degrade women and change the way they live.   \nThese readings showcase all the ways men and society has impacted women's sexuality and the norms have not stopped coming. But knowing the consequences and norms that result in this problem we can collectively change the roles and change the gender inequality to equality.",

        "text": "SOC 105\n31 March 2021\nEssay Brief 9\n\tA problem is developing in my generation as well as the upcoming one, where kids and young adults are becoming addicted to their electronic devises. A prime example is this past weekend, I was at the local Chipotle in Wilmington and as I ate my delicious burrito, I noticed an older teen was watching a YouTube vide while eating dinner with his mother. The experience looked awkward as the mother was trying to make conversation, which can be explained by Erving Goffman and Yuval Harari.\n\tChapter five of \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st century\u201d, Harari talks about how the community is slowly being taken over by the algorithms of technology. He criticizes Mark Zuckerberg on the way he is trying to \u201cconnect\u201d people through Facebook. In reality it is dividing people and stopping the interaction of shared experiences, which can be further explained by Goffman. In \u201cThe Presentation of Self\u201d, Goffman explains that in a performance of an interaction each member needs to actively play the role that they are expected to be, or the situation fails. He explains this through the idea of the front stage and backstage, where individuals prepare for the front stage of acting as the collective role they are supposed to play. \n\tThe awkward chipotle relates in the fact that the mother was ready and on the frontstage, whereas the teen was still in the backstage. Through Harari it is identified that technology is a barrier to the front stage which keeps individuals in the backstage. This creates awkwardness in situations because there isn\u2019t communication amongst the \u201cactors\u201d.",

The first reading titled The Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber portrays his idea of capitalism and the theoretical concept of \u201cthe iron cage\u201d. This concept refers to the principles of social structure and bureaucracy that had evolved while the system of capitalism remained. He suggests the idea that money is prolific, comparing it to nature, essential for shaping life. The economic relationships within capitalism that essentially shape social life is proved with his idea of the iron cage.\u00a0\nThe second reading titled Estranged Labour by Karl Marx portrays his own view of capitalism under an economic system. His idea is that society tends to divide itself into two classes. He refers to these two classes as \u201cproperty owners and property-less workers\u201d. These two classes face considerable differences and the workers often experience an estrangement and alienation from the word. Marx theory states that this alienation occurs in several ways. One way is because the workers' lives are devoted to the products they are working on and the outside world, that of which they do not belong. One other way is because the workers' lives are consumed by that product, it exists outside of them and signifies a loss of self.\u00a0\nThese two theorists' arguments on capitalism relate in many ways. They both believe that there is a greater factor in shaping social life. Weber believes this factor is the economy while Marx believes it is social class. However, both theorists agree that the basis of class division relies on ownership versus non ownership. While one group continues to prosper, the oher will lag behind. This idea continues to grow and become increasingly more relevant within society.\nThe economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and unemployment rates are comparable to these ideas. It unfortunately proved what class people really were in. You saw huge corporations with wealth continue to grow, prosper, and stay that way all throughout the past year. While those businesses stayed in theoretical \u201cpower\u201d, small businesses with not as much standing fell apart, alienated from the rest of the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

        "text": "1940\nSoc 105-002\nHow Women Fought for Their Spot into The Power Elite\n\tWhen we look at how feminism over time combines with the power elite, we see the growth of society. These women at one point were not allowed to work and were only thought of as someone to care for children and take care of the house. Now not only do some women have a job in a primarily male position, but a position of power in that job. This is a significantly positive change in society. The first women power elite CEO in the United States was Anna Bissell. In 1889, Anna Bissell became the CEO of Bissell Carper Sweeper Company. A little under 100 years later, Katharine Graham became the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company, The Washington Post. These two women made history by holding a position of power after fighting for gender equality. While this history being made is very exponential, in some areas of life, feminism, and the power elite correlation still needs improvement. We can see this in the scenario of promotion and paying a CEO for let\u2019s say a car company, and two applicants, one man, and one woman. If both applicants have equal elite schooling, equal past experience and training, the man would still be more likely to be promoted. If both applicants were promoted to be Co-CEO\u2019s, the women would be getting paid less than the man. Both of these situations of becoming a power elite go against the feminist advancements. To go along with this scenario, the fact that the company is a car company, and the women is getting less credit for her role shows that there are certain things that people see as interesting for men versus women. While it is great to see that women are able to work and get jobs as power elites, it is sad to know that there are still some things that the current feminist waves need to advocate for. \n\tThe feminist movement has changed the lives of women in a significant amount of ways. Women are considered in a more respectable manner, can vote, seen as more than the person who cares for the children and house, and work in positions of power. Simone De Beauvoir said that society viewed men as a subject and women as an other. This meant that society viewed men as purposeful and powerful, and women as meaningful only when referenced to a man. The second feminism wave knocked this societal view down some, and feminist movements now continue to fight this. Women being able to become part of the power elite inspires other women as well as closes the difference in the discrimination between them and men. While instances like the gender wage gap and employer preference for certain jobs still exist, women have made substantial improvements in almost everything else. Women today continue to reach dreams of being a CEO, or other power elite jobs, especially because women in the past weren\u2019t allowed to get anywhere close to that power. As women strive to climb the ladder at the job, they also want to continue to gain equality and continue the feminist ways. ",

        "text": "SOC 105\nMay 2, 2022\nBeauty Myth and its Effects on Society\n\tThe Beauty Myth is a phenomenon by Naomi Wolf explaining the ways modern society restricts women. In the past ideologies set up women as caretakers, homemakers, and mothers. Women were property of their fathers and then their husbands. If their husbands died, their sons oversaw them. Now, women are not married off to settle debts, or are married to old men to create political bonds or for social status. They are seen as equal to men in the eyes of society and the law. So, then what makes Wolf believe that women are still restricted in society? Her answer is the overwhelming obsession with physical perfection forced into modern women. It is mental aberration that has never been seen before and formed by inconspicuous psychological pressures placed throughout everyday life. \nWomen haven\u2019t always been seen as beneath men. In hunter-gather days, the men would hunt large game and women would gather, and later farm. This system allowed both genders to place food on the table and provide for the family, by playing to their own strengths. However as technology, agriculture, medicine, and society has advanced, women were placed into more and more of an oppressed role. Finally, in the early 1900s, women began fighting for gender equality again and gained the right to vote. Ever since, women have slowly gained a more equal status with men in society and law. However, with the rise of this status, the \u201cideal woman\u201d has become an impossible goal. Beauty standards for women no longer represent what real women look like. It would be more accurately described as a sexualized girl than a woman. \nThese \u201cperfect women\u201d have been placed all throughout society, creating a fake idea in men's minds. These advertisements make men believe that these 'perfect\u2019 women exist and are all over the world. Because men so often see these fake girls, who smile at them and are advertised to be available to men, real women and the real world doesn\u2019t meet their standards. These standards can lead to mentally unstable men, like Elliot Rodgers, feel rejected when women don\u2019t smile, flirt, or have sex with them. Rodgers was a twenty-two-year-old who killed six people and injured twenty two more during a rage. Before his rage he proclaimed in videos and a manifesto that he was the closest thing there was to a living god and could not comprehend why women didn\u2019t want to have sex with him. The \u201cperfect\u201d women in advertisements, tv shows, movies, and social media convinced him that women were supposed to simply be available for men to have. These platforms don\u2019t just twist the minds of men, but also twist the minds of women. Advertisements which include a photoshopped \u201cperfect\u201d girl and say to women that their product can make you look like her.\nThe beauty standards placed into the minds of every young girl are very strict; 1. Your hair must be long, pin straight, and blonde. 2. You must have clear skin with big eyes, long lashes and a small nose and chin. 3. Your body must be toned, but not too muscular.  4. You can\u2019t have any visible fat, but you must have a nice sized butt and breast. 5. You must be natural, not have surgery, because scars are ugly. 6. You can\u2019t have stretch marks from growing, you can\u2019t be too tall or too short, and you shouldn\u2019t have any body hair. 7. The ideal measurement for your body is an hourglass shape with a bust of 36 inches, a waist of 24 inches, and hips of 36 inches. 8. You must always be smiling, friendly and talkative, but not fake, sexual, or loud. This list is a small percentage of the standards placed on women. Women have been flogged the idea that to be beautiful or no one will love us. This fake ideal woman made up in society's mind is constantly reinforced in society. These platforms don\u2019t simply make women try to be \u2018prettier\u2019, but they enforce the idea upon women that it is possible to look like this. \nThe idea of these \u2018perfect\u2019 women don't simply trick the minds of men and women about how they should act and look, but they disrupt the natural order of what girls and boys should act like at different ages. Beer ads often show smiling women flirting with a man at the bar or scantily clad women on a river. These companies are taking the idea of the \u2018perfect\u2019 woman and using girls from the ages of 17 to mid-twenties to try and fit this idea. These young girls used in advertisements tell older men to be more attracted to younger women. It then makes the women in the same age range as the men feel much older than they are. This system tells men they are allowed to have fun, party, and sleep around from their teenage years until their early thirties, and forces women to think they should be married and settled down in their mid-twenties. The Beauty Myth causes women to age, socially, faster than men.\nThe beauty Myth doesn\u2019t just affect teenage and adult women. The infiltration of this way of thinking begins while a mother is still pregnant. Many girl baby clothes include sayings like, \u201cmy daddy can fight\u201d, making the girl already subject to the idea saying she should grow up to be pretty enough so her dad must fight boys away from her. As the girl grows up, she is given dolls which are not made to represent her or real women, but the ideal woman. Girls in their early teenage years are given makeup and told to start shaving. This is the start of wanting to change their natural body to fit a certain look. These small, seemingly insignificant details of a girl's life are the brainwashing of women to look a certain way. Women are not only told to look a certain way for men or by society. They place themselves and other women under extreme scrutiny.\n It is well known that the way we see ourselves is very different from the way others see us, because of our sensations and feelings, we see ourselves in a far more detailed way than anyone else could ever see us. We can hold on to a single memory of our mothers pointing out acne on our face as a preteen, and the embarrassment and shame we felt along with it, and scrutinize every pore on our face for the rest of our lives. These feelings along with this memory can develop bad habits like obsessive compulsive skin picking disorder. For the rest of our life, every time they feel embarrassed or anxious, we will scratch at our skin. This scratching can cause deep scars and ruin the chances of ever getting the \u2018perfect skin\u2019, causing more embarrassment. Another example of the distress caused by the beauty myth is the development of body dysmorphia. This mental disorder is the inability to perceive what you actually look like and often shows up in things like picking sizes in clothes and causes eating disorders.\nNaomi Wolf believes that beauty is the \"last, best belief system that keeps male dominance intact\". It pitches women against each other in a race to achieve the impossible. The Beauty Myth affects how women view themselves, how women view other women, and how men view women. The rise in rebranding of famous toy brands, like Barbie, is a step in the right direction in eliminating the Beauty Myth from a young age. Barbie now has four different body types for their doll and include many different races. Savage X Fenty is a clothing brand which has put lots of effort into designing clothes for all body types and showing many races as the faces of their brand. Many brands are taking steps in the right direction with body positivity and racial inclusion. However, brands need to include girls with less makeup, scars, acne, and different facial structures. ",

        "text": "SOC 105-002\n28 April 2021\nThe Beauty Myth and Modern Feminism\n\tThe Beauty Myth is a book written by Naomi Wolf in 1990 where she formulates an ideology about women and beauty. In this book she talks about the different ways that women have progressed throughout society and the ways they have fought for the rights that they have. She discusses how even though they have broken into positions of power that have not existed for women in the past, there are new issues that arise with each breakthrough. She mentions all the ways that women will tear down their bodies and go through strenuous dieting, physical activity, and surgery just to look in the mirror and see a body that pleases them. (Wolf 9) These are some of the ideas that lead her to come up with the beauty myth. She defines the beauty myth as the apparent or assumed want of women to look beautiful due to the belief that this beauty is going to lead them to more success. (Wolf 10)\n\tThe beauty myth is both very simple and very complex and in terms of modern feminism there are different ways to look at it. History has gone through two major waves of feminism that have broken down many barriers for women, but there will always be things left to fight for. This is where the third wave of feminism can be seen in the present day. The beauty myth and Modern Feminism go hand and hand and can be looked at and applied to many ideas and modern problems. The beauty myth and its existence in society have major negative effects on Modern Feminism and the ways that women are treated. The beauty myth is seen affecting women with eating disorders and their economic effects, prescriptive beauty norms and its hierarchy, as well as feminizing and controlling women and their racial constructs. \n\tIn the last 30 years the rates of eating disorders and obesity in women and girls has exponentially increased to dangerous levels and the outlining reasons behind these increased rates can be tied back to the beauty myth. Well known eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia have risen roughly 3%, from 1% to 4%, in females in the United States. Rates of bulimia nervoasa in college and high school females are estimated to be about 20%, but when representative testing and sampling is done, it is closer to 5%. The likely cause of the inflation of these numbers is seen as consciousness-raising efforts brought on by Wolf\u2019s Beauty Myth. There has also been increased rates of obesity where a very negative social stigma has been created around being overweight. (Averett 304-305) What these statistics are able to explain is the truths about the existence and severity of eating disorders and obesity in females. While numbers like 4% and 5% don\u2019t seem exceptionally high, it means that standing in a room with 100 females, 4 of them are going to suffer from anorexia nervosa or bulimia and 5 of them suffering from bulimia nervosa. What the beauty myth has done with numbers like these is inflate them for people to see, and create a stigma around the diseases. It does this with the intention to scare women into taking better care of their body and encouraging unhealthy mindsets that ultimately cause more harm than good. \nAfter examining the reasons for the increased rates of eating disorders and obesity another problem can be looked at, which is the statistics that detail the economic losses that these women are suffering from due to having an eating disorder or being obese. The economic status of someone suffering from an eating disorder or someone who is obese can suffer for manny reasons both simple and complex. A simple, surface level reason is to say that these people are not physically able to work some jobs, thus preventing them from being able to work. Not to say that these people don\u2019t exist, but when looking at the people who are perfectly able to work and are working, these people are making significantly less money. Averett says, \u201cIn employment-selectivity corrected wage equations, the pay differential is minus 12 percent for obese women and minus 5 percent for obese men.\u201d, which shows the blatant discriminatin against obese people and even more so, obese women. (306) Averett goes on to list more specific statistics of different age groups that have suffered economic losses do to the fact that they are obese. The statistics are simple and direct and they show a direct correlation between economic losses being greater in obese women than in obese men or men and women of a standard weight class. Where the beauty myth comes into this is when you apply the definition of the beauty myth to the employers who are making these wage decisions. Employers expect that someone who is physically fit or more appealing to the eye is going to work better and is worthy of more money. The beauty myth is able to showcase that if a woman who is obese and a woman who is not obese applied for the same job with the same exact resume, then the woman who is not obese will get the job and get a hihger salary becaus her appearance gives the idea that she will be a better worker. \nPrescriptive Beauty Norms can be defined as ways that women will spend time, money, and effort to attain the level of beauty seen in society, and these norms affect many aspects of modern day feminism and do a great deal to hinder women\u2019s progress. A lot of women have the ability to take beauty norms like dressing up and wearing makeup and genuinely enjoy them and gain a sense of empowerment from feeling beautiful and put together. It is not that easy for everyone as some women will either not have the resources, not have the money, or not have the capabilities to do these things on a regular basis. This is where the beauty norms start to be taken as disempowering as Ramati-Ziber writes, \u201cHowever, when intense social pressure turns pursuing beauty into a mandate (rather than a freely chosen activity), beauty practices become socially coercive, an obligation women must fulfill or risk being \u201c. . . deemed uncivilized and immoral\u201d(Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997, p. 182)\u201d. (318) The disempowerment comes when these beauty norms are being forced and not seen as an option. This broadcasts a feeling to women where they believe that they have to be fully out together to go out for the day or society is going to make negative opinions about them. The Beauty Norm is seen as the push to enjoy these norms and feel empowerment from them, but in reality the too heavy push toward empowerment turns into disempowerment. \nAfter defining Prescriptive Beauty Norms, also known as PBN, they can be applied to the beauty myth and the way this is done is through the built in Hierarchy-Enhancing effects of the beauty myth. In Wolf\u2019s books she further defines the beauty myth through many different lenses and goes on to explain that it is more about types of behavior that is encouraged and not solely appearance. What this means is that there is a gender hierarchy that becomes enforced showcasing the different body types and how they are seen in society. Ramati Ziber describes the main three components of the beauty myth as, \u201c(a) beauty ideals, which Toledano (2012) suggests include both \u201cbiological,\u201d less easily modified, bodily standards (e.g., youth, thinness) and \u201cperformed,\u201d more malleable, grooming standards (e.g., wearing make-up and high heels); (b) attainability beliefs, believing that beauty ideals can be reached via beauty practices; and (c) the PBN, which prescribes women to intensively strive for and prioritize attainting beauty.\u201d (319) These different components are what push the hierarchy as each component has certain things that make someone more desirable and are going to put them higher up in the hierarchy. Someone who did not have the good traits from these components is going to be lower down on the hierarchy. The beauty myth pushes people into categories based on how many of these components they satisfy. \nBurcar analyzes the beauty myth through the lens of Toni Morrison\u2019s The Bluest Eye and she breaks down the ways that the Myth has made gendered beauty norms into a way of feminizing and controlling women. The Bluest Eye is about a woman who decides to leave her domestic confinement and head to Hollywood To pursue a career in cinema. Very quickly she discovers the intense representations in cinema that cater to, \u201cFeminine beauty and whiteness\u201d, and explains how these things made it difficult for her. (Burcar 141) Women in Hollywood are seen simply as a body that is available for manipulation, and even though all they want is bodies that can be decorated at their disposal, there is only a specific group of bodies that is going to please them. Being successful in Hollywood and having a career in front of a screen all comes down to if they can fit the mold of what is deemed to be beautiful, and can this beauty be used and capitalized off of. The beauty myth very obviously fits the mold of Hollywood because just like the beauty myth, in Hollywood if you are beautiful you are going to be successful and if you are not their idea of beautiful then you will not be successful. \nBucar also analyzes the effects of the beauty myth in The Bluest Eye as it pertains to the racial constructs of beauty. Racism and the Racialized constructs of beauty go hand and hand and have come about and developed at the same time. Racism alone is a social construct used to divide people into groups that simply do not need to exist, and the same can be seen with beauty. Beauty in itself dissects people into who is conventionally beautiful and not beautiful, and these groups can be further broken down with race. A student from a 2016/2017 seminar provided this analysis of The Bluest Eye, \u201cPecola is black and because of that she is not just ugly in the eyes of Mr. Yacobowski, she is not even worth his glance. He does not want to look at her. It seems as if he is looking through her as if she were invisible. This invisibility is even worse than just hatred or disgust, because even if you are hated at least you are perceived as a person.\u201d (Burcar 148) This analysis of The Bluest Eye details the intense effect of racism within the beauty myth. Not only was the teacher outwardly racist doward Pecola, but due to this racism he would never even consider her to be beautiful and fit into beauty norms. The beauty myth ties directly into racial constructs and people's perception of what is beautiful, and shows a further step into someone's analysis of what is beauty. \nThe beauty myth can be defined many ways and throughout daily life it could be stumbled upon 100 times without even realizing it. Naomi Wolf defined the beauty myth in 1990 but that is not to say that it did not exist before. The reality is that it has likely always existed and her book in 1990 only brought to light a fraction of the way that it affects women. In the twenty-first century as society is moving through the third wave of feminism, it is the first major femenism movement since the existence of Naomi Wolf\u2019s book. What this means is that, as modern feminists fight for more rights, equal treatment, equal respect, better wages, and more representation, the beauty myth can be dissected in these fights.  The beauty myth and its existence in society have had major negative effects on Modern waves of Feminism and the ways that women are treated. The beauty myth is seen majorly affecting women suffering from eating disorders and obesity and their economic effects, prescriptive beauty norms and the hierarchies enforced, as well as feminizing and controlling women and their racial beauty constructs. \n\n\nWorks Cited\nAverett, Susan, and Sanders Korenman. \u201cThe Economic Reality of the Beauty Myth.\u201d The Journal of Human Resources, vol. 31, no. 2, 1996, pp. 304\u2013330.

        "text": "850620656\nOn the other hand, Karl Marx's study of the \"conscious self\" delves thoroughly into the notion that the superstructure\u2014which consists of institutions, politics, and culture\u2014is essentially shaped by the economic foundation of society, which consists of the mode of production and class relations. Marx held that a person's social circumstances mold their consciousness, and that by altering these circumstances, people might grow a class consciousness that propels societal change. This theory draws attention to the possibility of human action within a capitalism system that frequently appears to be unchanging and unbreakable. This Marxian idea of rising consciousness leading to organized resistance and potential transformation is seen, for instance, in the modern labor movement and its growing understanding of workers' rights and collective bargaining.\nBy contrasting these views, a nuanced understanding of contemporary capitalism is revealed. On the one hand, it appears that corporate models constantly impose inflexible patterns on many facets of life, reducing human connections to transactions\u2014the mechanistic dehumanization that Ritzer warned against. Marx's optimism, however, about the conscious self's capacity for change offers a counterbalance, implying that these same circumstances can provoke a collective awakening and reclaim of personal agency. In the digital age, this tension between the limiting forces of McDonaldization and the liberating possibilities of Marxian consciousness is most apparent. In addition to providing activists and marginalized communities with previously unheard-of means for communication and organization, technology is also frequently used by companies to increase productivity and control. This dual character is demonstrated by social media platforms' worldwide reach, which may both mobilize social movements and promote cross-border solidarity while simultaneously serving as a vehicle for the commercialization of personal data and interactions. The continuous conflict between the impersonal forces of capitalism and the persistent human need for independence and significant change is captured by this dichotomy.\nIn summary, examining Karl Marx's \"conscious self\" and George Ritzer's \"McDonaldization\" offers important new perspectives on how structure and agency interact in capitalist society. Marx's idea underscores the possibility of a conscious awakening and societal reform, while McDonaldization emphasizes the ubiquitous effects of efficiency and standardization on human creativity and autonomy. This contrast highlights the constant conflict between pursuing individual and group emancipation and complying to structural demands, while also enhancing our comprehension of contemporary capitalism. Analyzing these theories critically promotes more in-depth thought about how we fit into these dynamics and how to move toward a society that is more egalitarian.",

        "text": "First Reflection Essay \nIn the mountains of North Carolina, there are about one thousand acres of land owned by two men. This place is called Turtle Island Preserve. In the summers, Turtle Island Preserve hosts summer camps for young men from the ages of ten to eighteen. These camps last two weeks and place an emphasis on the skills they teach young men about traditional survival skills. I attended these camps for four years and was exposed to a culture that I would have never found if I had not attended the camps. However, the culture which Turtle Island proudly boasts as one of inclusivity and acceptance, is much more prone to the pitfalls of hegemonic masculinity and the hierarchical pyramid of domination that accompanied this culture. \nTo give you a better idea of the exact circumstances that bred this culture of hegemonic masculinity, allow me to explain the demographic that this camp typically attracted. During my four summers attending the camp, I never saw a single camper or counselor that wasn\u2019t white. Any women that were living or working on the land were kept far away from the campers. This included them eating at different times. So while there were women living on the land during the boys two week camp, our exposure to them was limited as much as possible. All of the counselors were ex-campers that were over eighteen and therefore not technically allowed to be campers. This concoction of all male, all white campers and counselors formed a sort of singular culture within the camp that was based around hedgemonic values. \nTurtle Island Preserve challenges young men to face their fears via a set of challenges. These challenges include slaughtering pigs, running 3 miles with a mouth full of water, spending a night alone in the woods, taking a polar plunge (jumping into a freezing cold pond) at dawn, and a night hike. The camp also had trouble with campers becoming violent with one another. Nobody was ever seriously hurt but there were at least one or two fights per summer between campers. These fights were the result of campers trying to exert dominance over eachother and move up the pyramid of hedgemonic masculinity. \nWhen campers first arrive at Turtle Island they are exposed to a hierarchy of command and told to obey that chain of command. This included meeting all of the staff on site and learning who all of the counselors are. The campers are then divided into four groups asked to pick a speaker or leader for their group. The leader the group elects remains the leader for the rest of the camp. This would immediately cause problems within some groups because multiple people wanted to be leader. The role of leader usually fell to the oldest person in the group as they were trusted to be the most reposonible. However, having a leader become appointed based on very little to no real merit caused problems. The leaders were trusted by the counselors and would settle disputes between campers. The leaders almost always showed favoritism to their friends or the people they liked the most. \nThe establishment of leaders within groups also allowed for bullying and a sort of hive mind to be born within the camp. If a camper had a weak stomach and couldn\u2019t stand the sight of pigs blood they would be teased. If a camper was scared of the dark and had a hard time falling asleep outdoors at night they would be teased. This mentality amongst campers forced the idea of hedgemonic masculinity onto the social structure of the camp. I specifically remember a game called gladiator that we were playing during my second year. The game consists of two people standing on a log and trying to push eachother off. The last person standing on the log wins and a new challenger approaches. This game exonerated the hedgemonic value of being tough and capable of dispatching multiple opponents by yourself. However, this game led to a small selection of mostly older campers that were bigger and stronger completely dominating the younger and often smaller campers by quite literally throwing them to the ground. At the time, the game just seemed like fun. But now I know that this activity reinforced this social hierarchy predicated on how well each person fits the hedgemonic values of the camp. \n\tThe camp utilized this pressure to be hegemonic as a way to get young men to face their fears. One activity in particular was the most infamous for establishing who was and was not worthy of praise and respect. The activity was called the \u2018night hike\u2019, but that makes it sound too simple. It was an activity in which our counselor would march the group about a mile into the woods in a random direction and make the campers wait until the sun went down. The counselor would then confiscate any flashlights the campers had brought with them and would make the campers navigate their way back to the camp by themselves with no light. Without fail, someone would be unable to complete this task and start crying for help. Ironically, these cries were always met with snickering and comparisons to a frightened animal by the other campers. The people who could not complete this challenge were seen as weak and were often picked on for the remainder of the camp. Those who could complete the challenge without any sort of fear or hesitation were seen as brave and their social status was vaulted. So in a way, these challenges became a way for campers in less than desirable social positions to improve their status through a literal test of mental fortitude. \n\tThe same logic applies to the other challenges. If you couldn\u2019t take the polar plunge you were considered a coward. If you couldn\u2019t run three miles with a mouth full of water you were weak. If you couldn\u2019t spend a night along in the woods alone you were deemed as lesser than those who could. So while we were learning traditional survival skills, the camp was also reinforcing this idea of independence and a toughness-over-all mentality. Those that were established as weak or less masculine than the rest of the camp were picked on relentlessly until the proved themselves in one of the challenges. Then the ridicule would switch to some other camper who was unable to complete the challenges. It was this type of toxic mindset that caused the campers to face their fears. No camper ever did these challenges out of want. They did them out of necessity and to avoid bullying by the rest of their group. So though the idea behind these challenges is a pure one, and facing your fears can be healthy, the way in which each camper\u2019s performace dictated their status meant that people felt forced to complete the challence or suffer the consequences. \n\tThe hedgemonic values of being tough, independent, dominant, and brave were all taught and reinforced over and over again during my four years at Turtle Island. The survival skills were really a secondary education when you compare just how much the camp is centered around making young boys into young men. The methods may seem extreme but they work pretty well as long as you can handle the violence and bullying aspects of the method. However it\u2019s not all bad. \n\tThe time I spent at Turtle Island preserve exposed me to the hedgemonic lifestyle and allowed me to understand that hierarchy in a more forgiving atmosphere than the ones I encountered later in life. I also think that similar to the boys in Rockport, the boys at Turtle Island Preserve end up forming very tightly knit friendship for the duration of their stay and leaving camp always feels more sad than it should. When you consider that most fo the camp is just one test after then other in an effort to dominate those you call friends, I\u2019m surprised that anyone got along at all. I believe that this connection between domination and kinship comes from out biological programmedness to dominate and protect. Men want to feel valued and feel important and are willing to do abnormal things in order to earn that respect. But, on the flipside, once we prove our strength, we select others who have not proven themselves and pressure them into proving their own masculinity. \n\tI know that the conditions and the activities that took place at Turtle Island may seem cruel and unusual but I agree with the author of the Rockport reading when he says that the boys ultimately benefit from their experience in this type of hedgemonic culture. Though I feel no need to create my own subculture of hedgemonic values, I think being exposed to that kind of hyper masculine system was good for me and is an integral part of who I am today. But, I\u2019m sure not everyone that attended Turtle Island benefitted from their experience. \nThe bullying was constant for those who could not prove themselves and the effects of being othered by a group of people that don\u2019t respect you is potentially very dangerous. Looking back on it now, I feel lucky to have mostly avoided the ridicule of my cabinmates. And I feel real remorse for not standing up for people who were being bullied. The biggest downside to the hedgemonic lifestyle is the complete lack of empathy. When people are judged on skill and dominance and everything becomes a competition, the humanity of each person begins to fade. Everyone is trying to dominate each other which sadly means that someone has to be dominated. \nI think the hedgemonic lifestyle is inherently problematic and should not be the sole provider of worth in a society. Though I got through my time at Turtle Island relatively unscathed, I think it\u2019s important to note that I have mostly rejected the hedgemonic values espoused by the camp. A lifestyle based in the domination of everyone around you can breed deep resentment and sadness. Not to mention how unhealthy it is to never let your guard down and just be comfortable in your own skin. To feel like you constantly have to prove your worth to both yourself and your peers is an incredibly stressful way to live and may lead to substance abuse later in life. Though some things can be learned from hedgemonic masculinity, relying on it as a sort of one-size-fits-all approach to being a man is dangerous and causes people to lose their humanity in chasing social recognotion.

It has taken a long time for society to take women as seriously as they do, but there will likely never be a time when men and women are truly equal.

        "text": "1486\nPsychology 105-001\n3 May 2024 \nWhite Privilege and Middle Class\n \tEveryone has heard of the term white privilege and the term middle class so much so that they might even be living both of them to the fullest. While it is easy to assume that each person\u2019s definition is the correct one and that the benefits of each outweigh the history; perhaps some have no clue about what each of these terms truly mean along with how they are interconnected. The middle class has a very broad range of families including some who make fifteen thousand dollars a year to others who make well over two hundred thousand dollars a year. Are these families that are on the upper end of the middle class living out the perfect white privilege scenario without even noticing? White privilege is a term that simply means that people who are white are granted certain aspects of life due to their skin color which other skin colors wouldn\u2019t be able to indulge in. White privilege and the middle class have a significant correlation that many may have never thought about or noticed but is an issue that needs to be addressed. \n\tWhite privilege, having an invisible package of unearned assets that can be cashed in every day to help out a white human. This means that every day, due to skin color, white people have a safer advantage than others who may have a different color of skin. This is a systematic approach that developed due to racism. Throughout the years, white people have fed into racism and constantly perpetuated it meaning that all it takes is one act of meanness for racism to come back in spiraling. The white privilege concept goes on to treat race as a property of the body rather than anything else such as a characteristic of someone. White privilege operates on both conscious and unconscious levels, challenging various aspects of life, including education, employment, housing, healthcare, and the criminal justice system for people who aren\u2019t white. While this doesn't mean that all white individuals live privileged lives or do not face hardships throughout their lives, it does acknowledge that race is not a barrier to their success or safety in the same way it is for people who have different skin colors. \n\tMiddle class is a very broad term for which people see themselves on the spectrum of how they live and the money they make/spend. This is the middle term for the broad term of social class which is a particular collective consciousness that is produced through wealth. Social class shapes the experience of social reality through the collective consciousness. The collective consciousness is what shapes your values, and beliefs, and also provides context for the self to experience external domains.  Within the middle class, it is found that families send their children to public school and have social activities in which they indulge. While some people are born into the middle class, others work their way up from the bottom by providing for themselves and taking opportunities that come their way. It is found that race, parents, and gender are all aspects that affect the class that people grow up to be a part of. \n\tWhite privilege and class privilege are intertwined particularly in the middle-class era. Not only does this highlight the complexities of social advantages and disadvantages, but it also shows just how the white privilege invisible package is put into place within the real world. Although all individuals from any race or gender can be part of the middle class, white middle-class people are often the ones who continue to live out and experience the additional perks of privilege due to their race. They may benefit from their families' inherited wealth or family connections which ties in with the factor that everyone is affected by their parents or how they were raised. This results in different opportunities coming to different people due to connections from parents and families who continue helping their children and shaping their futures. This leads them to be more likely to reside in neighborhoods with better schools and resources, have access to higher-paying jobs, and encounter fewer problems when seeking loans or investments. Even within the middle class, racial disparities are still encountered although white individuals do still experience greater advantages and better opportunities simply because of their race. \n\tIn conclusion, it is easier for people who are white to experience the perks of living in the middle status and accept opportunities that come within. While not everyone who experiences middle class is white, it is still easier for white people to get jobs, gain experience, and get better connections than someone with a different skin color who may have more barriers that are preventing them from something that they are trying to do. The middle class is a very broad term that a lot of people within the United States fall under and get to experience but with that may come scenarios where racism, rights, and even opportunities are not being provided fairly among all skin colors. This has been an ongoing problem for generations due to most people feeding into and constantly perpetuating mean actions toward people who are different than them. While it would be very hard to reverse racism, the world would be a much better place if everyone treated each other with respect and disregarded skin color, class differences, and differing opinions.",

        "text": " \nSoc 105\n8 February 2021\nConception of self\n\tIn tv entertainment I get caught up in an actors life so much that when I see them in different program it catches me off guard. For example, John Krasinski, he plays Jim Halpert from the office as well as Jack Ryan from Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan. For the longest time whenever I saw Mr. Krasinski in any film, I always gave him the persona as Jim from the office. This briefs the idea of the conception of self and how an individual sees themselves from a third- and first-person point of view.\n\tErving Goffman proclaims that the self is collectively produced and that for the self to be defined the \u201ccollective\u201d third person needs to interact with the first-person. This interaction expands the idea that the social aspect is an important factor in the thought of self. In correspondence to George Mead, the \u201cI\u201d is the reaction because of the environment and the \u201cme\u201d is a reaction in response to the \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cMe\u201d is autonomous feelings towards self that contextualizes from the consciousness. Both philosophers communicate the concept that conversation, whether it be from an outside source or within yourself, is key to understanding the idea of self.\n\tThe example with John Krasinski; when people meet him in person is becomes confusing for the audience because they are not used to that type of role with Mr. Krasinski, but rather with Jim or Jack. John\u2019s acting assimilated to  the \u201cI\u201d in Mead\u2019s theory then, on the outside his personal life could be seen as the \u201cme\u201d. This is present in daily life with your peers, meaning that everyone has differently roles and it becomes confusing, even awkward, if the roles are not met. ",

        "text": "SOC 105\n28 April 2021\nSystemic Racism in the Current State of the U.S\nRacism is a major topic in America today with the murders of innocent citizens, social justice movements, and accusations of systemic oppression within the health care field. This fast-growing, social-civil issue has risen back to the platform of importance due to the recent controversial actions within the U.S government. What exactly defines the system of \u201cracism\u201d? \"Race\" is a social construct created by the majority entirely based on racial differences (Hutto and Green 2016). Looking back to the early days of American history, we can see that racism has been rooted in America's upbringing since its beginning. With slavery being one of the main foundations of America during the colonial era, up until the Civil War, it has systematic roots buried into almost every government system or institution. However, people believe that the 1960s when the Jim Crow laws were abolished and more Civil Rights Laws were added was the last time America could be considered a racist nation. Despite the judicial legal rights African Americans gained from this era, these laws could not stop the racial background of the U.S.\u2019s government systems who would counter-act their rights. Throughout this paper, I will discuss the current systematic racism that is affecting the justice system and health care systems in the U.S, and how it was structurally created.  \nTo begin to see how systematic racism still exists in today\u2019s America, we will have to understand the framework of racism. The beginning of these racial schemes could be explained best by using one of the articles used in class, Estranged Labour by Karl Marx. The Marxian idea of capitalism is the complex framework that allows racism to carry into current-day society. Capitalism is summed down into two parts: the small capitalist class who own the means of production, and the working class who uses their labor to provide their money (Hutto and Green 2016). In simpler terms, the rich are the capitalist class, and the middle to poor class was the working. Back when capitalism first started, only the Caucasians could be the capitalist class, and the working class was predominantly African American. The capitalist class also systematically exploited the working class, which later brought oppression and suppression towards the working class. With Caucasians controlling the African Americans in early America\u2019s capitalist society, this prompted the social ideology of racism to start snowballing into other systems in America.   \nEven after attempts by some American governmental powers to stop the systematic racism so it will not corrupt the American governance. America\u2019s governmental systems still found a way to counteract them, for example, the creation of the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), who lead racially charged lynching, and other horrific actions towards African Americans. This white-supremacist ideology --made by the capitalist class-- would weaken and oppress the working class even more. With this new racist ideology, the capitalist class\u2019s efforts would subconsciously be ingrained into the minds of other whites (Hutto and Green 2016). This process is comparable to the formation of the collective consciousness, which was talked about in the first module of this course. The collective consciousness in white Americans started to slowly become more aligned with oppression towards the black Americans, due to the new racial ideology slowly furnishing American\u2019s minds. This one ideology became collective consciousness due to the fact it slowly infested a large population of white Americans which shaped these people to have a racist mindset. Whenever the capitalist class created this new national ideology, it made their system of capitalism stronger and the working class weaker and easier to exploit.  \nAnd since the working class became so easy to exploit, other systems of the U.S came to escalate the exploitation including racial police brutality, intimidation, and murder which all directly benefited the function of capitalism (Hutto and Green 2016). This led to racial ideals being anchored in some police forces, which later proved to be systematic racism at its prime. Police brutality has been around for a while and is still a dangerous culture that exists in today\u2019s America. In this culture, police have a predisposed reaction to generate greater readiness to use lethal force whenever faced with a person of color. Police brutality also includes the misconduct of treatment towards people with disabilities. This results in distrust towards the legal system from Americans and creates this battle of social justice between the police force and citizens fighting for justice. \nSome specific instances that police systems in America are discriminating and targeting black Americans are found in Prince George County. Where the police department created an undercover task force titled \u201cDeath Squad\u201d that would target African American men to entrapment for robbery to arrest them. Their brutality does not stop there, in 1969, this same police department killed an unarmed black man, which resulted in a large protest. The Prince George County Police Department also shot and killed an unarmed black man who was attempting to steal two 7-dollar country hams, on Christmas day. Police brutality has not changed at all since the late 1960s, and we are facing more police brutality ever more often. With the vociferous death of George Floyd, the issue of system racism in our police force has been revitalized and seen as an important topic for social injustices today. Many riots have resulted in police brutality in the 21st century due to the long-drawn-out issue that centers around police discrimination. So it is very understandable why African American communities have distrust in the American police system.  \nPeople of color have also distrusted the U.S government health care system, due to discrimination in the health field. Black Americans are more likely to trust black doctors, according to Evans et al., and research shows that a black man will receive better care from a doctor who is racially concordant compared to a doctor that is racially discordant. There is an element of structural racism in America\u2019s medical workforce, in which black Americans are less likely to become doctors compared to any other race. African Americans are found to face serious health inequities and a lack of support for health care coverage, along with a lower chance, compared to any other race to find a racially concordant doctor (Evans et al., 2020). This shows that people of color are discriminated against based on preventative measures, access to treatments, and other resource needs to ensure the health of these patients. Wingfield also states that discrimination occurs in the scientific research field as well, due to algorithms are designed to make decisions for health care incorporates biases that prevent the amount of care for African American patients. \nThis systematic racism in our health institutions creates more health disparities in our world, which is a racial disparity. This health disparity determines the difference in treatment of races. This can affect the quality and quantity of care for African American patients, and negatively affects the overall health of the race entirely. Studies have also shown that white applicants of grant programs ran by the U.S. National Institutes of Health received more money, compared to their black counterparts. This goes to show how inequality in our health care systems truly exists and need to be further fought against. \nSocial justice movements that include BLM (Black Lives Matter) have been created to start the fight for racial equality from police discrimination to healthcare. With fighting America will continue to have corruption and systemic racism in its Police departments and health care systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited:\nHutto, J. W., & Green, R. D. (2016).

        "text": "SOC 105\n26 March 2021\nThe Collective Upbringing: Religion\nNo matter if you believe in God, Yahweh, Buddha, or blue flying fish as a divine power, religion is eminent in composing societies\u2019 ethics and norms. Religion influences everything that constructs societies today, from social interactions to laws. According to Emile Durkheim, religion is the reasoning behind all great social institutions in society, however, without the collective representation of society, there would be no religion. Although religion has had such a massive impact on society, Yuval Harai believes that the social concepts are becoming less religious and more human.  \nThe collective consciousness is a mass of people having the same ideas or morals and doing similar rituals that result in a common social concept within the collective group. Religion, according to Durkheim, is the collective representation of most social concepts today, meaning that without religion being the fundamental ideas, then the principle of collective consciousness would not exist in the social setting. Religion has been important in many things in the world, for example, \u201cIn God, We Trust\u201d is printed on every American currency. The religion-based collective consciousness also affected the constitutional paper in America like the Declaration of Independence, where multiple remarks relate to God. However, these collective representations were made in the 18th century, which means the religious ideas in the papers could be possibly different from the collective social norms made today. \nHarai explains in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century that, individuals\u2019 free will and liberties used to be neglected by the collective belief that divine laws come from a higher power, before modern times. This idea is still being used in certain societies today across the globe, from third-world tribes to radical Christianity. Society used to be solely religious but now people are starting to become more spiritual. Today, social institutions are created by a collective of individual liberties of free will, which Harai believes is the collective idea of liberalism shaping our minds to live more freely. More liberties in America have become less religious, in the sense of choosing what to study, whom to marry, or which candidate or party to vote for, wherein some societies are all based on religious values and rules. \nThe idea of collective consciousness from Durkheim was the basis of the conceptualization of Harai\u2019s \u201cPart 3: Liberty\u201d in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. The concept of the collective believes today have brought more liberalism in our common practices like the personal choice of university studies, marriage, and political beliefs, which used to be religiously demonstrated. Durkheim\u2019s concept of collective consciousness was used in today\u2019s socially updated; by Harai to explain what our Liberties in society are based on.\n",

        "text": "6179\nActing On Who We Are\n\tWhen we look at the term hegemonic masculinity, we can also interpret it as doing gender. The term hegemonic masculinity is this behavior that men have the power within society over women. While the concept of doing gender is within the way we carry ourselves and feeling like we need to act a certain way based on our sex. Hegemonic masculinity is a prime example of men \u201cdoing gender\u201d. \nThen we have the term \u201chegemonic masculinity\u201d who is coined from the sociologist R.W. Connell. Hegemonic masculinity is a behavior that supports the power of men in society, and the subordination of women, other oppressed male identities, and the general male population. It is the practice of supporting male domination, the dominant form of masculinity, violence, and aggression. Men often feel that hegemonic masculinity benefits them when in reality it is hurting society. In the reading \u201cYou\u2019re Either In or You\u2019re out\u201d the boys asserted their dominance through bullying other people. Men want to assert their dominance because they have always been the ones in the most power, when that feels threatened they tend to use hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity is the standard for what a man should be as it is seen within society. The sense that men are aggressive, strong, that they provide, and overall an alpha. \nA real world example that could be used in both terms is when a husband feels like they need to be working more and making more money than his wife. Society has made it a social norm that men are the ones that are providing for their family. They are the ones that are supposed to be working the most and making the most money. Men want this feeling of having male domination over women, so if the wife is making more money than them then they tend to feel insecure and threatened. This is a prime example of doing gender because society makes men feel like they have to work more than women. When they indulge in that they are considered doing gender. They are the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d in the family. The gender roles in society is that men are the one providing for their family and the wife is more of a stay at home mom. It is also a prime example of hegemonic masculinity because they are asserting male dominance by having this power over women that they are the ones making more money than their wife. They feel dominant because they feel as if they are better than their wife in that sense. In society's standards men are supposed to be smarter and work harder than women.  \nAnother unfortunate real world example would be domestic violence. When a man hits a woman it is usually because they are insecure and their masculinity feels threatened in some way. It is known that society has this norm that when men get angry they get aggressive. Therefore, say a couple is arguing and the woman says something that questions a man's masculinity, the man might feel the need to hit the woman in order to feel like he has power over her. This shows doing gender because of the fact that men get angry which escalates to being aggressive. It is doing gender because men are supposed to feel masculine and they are proving to themselves that they are by acting in aggression. The body is often used as a tool for expressing our gender. In this case they use their body to feel strong against the women. It is also an example of hegemonic masculinity in the fact that they feel this need to prove their masculinity. They try to assert their dominance by hitting the women so they feel this sense of power. When the woman says something that makes them insecure they want to still feel like they have their masculinity. They get aggressive and violent to reclaim their masculinity.\n",

        "text": "Introduction to Sociology\n13 October 2021\nFront Stage and Backstage Behavior and Why it Exists\nWhy do people feel the need to change how they act based on the situation that they are in? The feeling that one has to behave differently depending on the situation is an almost universal one. Many people will keep their true selves hidden, with their real thoughts and feelings concealed behind a facade. They can only be revealed when the person is in a private setting. But what is it that drives people to be so self-conscious? In Sociology, there is a concept that explains this type of behavior. Originated by Erving Goffman, this is known as front and back stage behavior, the study of which is sometimes called dramaturgical analysis. Goffman introduced this concept in his book ,\u201cThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\u201d, published in 1956. In this book, Goffman describes social interaction between people as being similar to the interaction of roles in a theater play, which explains the front and back stage comparison. The \u201cfront stage\u201d is the way that people behave in front of an \u201caudience\u201d. The audience is usually a person or a group of people. Someone may make themself seem more confident, smart, or sociable than they actually are in order to make a good impression on their audience. Backstage behavior is the opposite - it is the behavior that one exhibits when there is no one else around to see it. There is no pressure to look or act presentable, so the person is able to truly let themself relax. This concept introduces the idea that everyone has a role that they are expected to play, and failure to do so will result in humiliation and ridicule from your audience. \nThe main question that I have is \u201cwhy?\u201d. Why do people feel so inclined to hide who they are? Is fitting in and playing your role really this important? What makes people so willing to change who they are just to please everyone else? One possible solution to this conundrum is impression management. Impression management, as defined by Erving Goffman in the same book that he introduced front stage and backstage behavior in, is the act of trying to present yourself or behave in a way that is considered acceptable by your audience. It is connected to front and back stage behavior, specifically front stage behavior, because it concerns the way that someone acts in front of their audience. An example of impression management could be someone making an effort to dress and speak formally when going into a job interview, even though in their day to day life they could act completely differently. The book \u201cImpression Management Theory and Social Psychological Research\u201d by James T. Tedeschi references a great example of impression management and why people are concerned with front stage behavior in the section \u201cAvoiding Blame and Getting Credit\u201d (pgs. 5-10). This section explains how many people are concerned with both getting credit for their positive actions and averting criticism for their negative actions. In figure 1.1 on page 6, the many different paths someone may take to either claim responsibility or innocence when faced with the consequences of their decisions is shown.When faced with the consequences of a poorly thought out choice, people may try to distance themselves from their actions in order to avoid punishment or blame for that action, thus avoiding any damage to their public image. They may also try to justify their actions by minimizing the impact of their outcome. When faced with the positive outcomes of a choice, someone may try to enhance the benefits of their decision to make their choice seem more admirable, or they could try to make themselves seem more responsible for the outcome. This type of impression management can be seen in our society in many different cases. For example, when someone does something harmful, they may apologize in a way that seems disingenuous. They may try to place some sort of blame on the people that they hurt with their decision by saying things like \u201cI am sorry that you feel that way\u201d, where the person is placing blame on the upset party for feeling hurt, rather than taking responsibility for causing the hurt. This is impression management because the person who did the harmful thing is trying to absolve themself of blame or guilt by transferring it onto another person, making them look better. This is also called blame-shifting. On page 7, the types of excuses that someone may use to preserve their self-image are listed, and they include the denial of bad intentions, lack of bodily control, and denials of agency. These are all excuses meant to distance a person from their actions. They are intended to convince others that the person who committed these actions did not have as much control over the situation as everyone thought, whether or not that is actually true. They are meant to make the person look better to their audience. \nSocietal expectations are also a big reason for why front stage and backstage behavior exists. These affect both front stage and backstage behavior. One\u2019s front stage behavior \u201creflects internalized norms and expectations for behavior shaped partly by the setting, the particular role one plays in it, and by one\u2019s physical appearance\u201d (Cole, Goffman\u2019s Front Stage and Back Stage Behavior). Concerning the front stage, the way that people are expected to act has a lot to do with how they present themselves. For example, customer service workers are expected to be courteous to all of their customers, even the ones that are unkind to them. If they don\u2019t fulfill this expectation, they may be met with scorn from their audience, and could lose their job. Business people are expected to be professional at all times, and in every aspect of their life, such as their speech and appearance. If they fail to do so, they too could lose their job. Students in a school are often expected by their peers to keep up with certain trends or they will be met with bullying. Clearly, a lot of importance is placed upon front stage behavior, so much so that the consequences of not playing your role can be catastrophic. Societal expectations can also influence a person\u2019s backstage behavior. For example, a student feeling pressured to follow certain trends at school may spend their time at home organizing outfits to wear to school, or a businessman concerned with looking professional may spend the hours after his shift is done rehearsing a presentation or an interview so that he does not embarrass himself in front of his coworkers. Societal expectations can differ from culture to culture, but one thing is certain. If someone fails to adhere to expectations, then they have failed to play their role, and the results can range from humiliating to devastating. There is a lot depending just on someone playing their role, including self-esteem and employment, which could also explain why keeping front stage and backstage behavior separate is important to many.\nIn conclusion, front stage and backstage behavior defines how people will behave differently depending on the situation that they are in. This concept was introduced by Erving Goffman, in his book \u201cThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\u201d, which used theater terms to describe social behaviors. Front stage behavior refers to how someone acts when they are in front of an \u201caudience\u201d. When engaging in front stage behavior, a person will often make themselves act differently in order to please their audience. Backstage behavior is the way that a person acts when no one is around to judge them. Although the person isn\u2019t expected to think about their front stage personas at this time, many will often spend this time preparing for the next time that they are in front of an audience. There are a couple of different reasons why someone would want to hide their true selves in order to please their audience. One of those reasons is impression management. Impression management is when someone presents themself in a way that makes them seem more pleasing to the audience. There are many different ways that impression management can manifest, several of those being in reaction to an action, good or bad. Depending on the consequences of the action that they took, a person may try to overstate their responsibility in the situation, distance themself from the action overall, or justify the decisions that they made. Another reason why someone would choose to behave differently in front of an audience is societal expectations. In all different cultures, and in all different situations, people have a lot of expectations placed upon them by society. Failure to live up to these expectations could result in embarrassment or ridicule from one\u2019s audience. Many are pushed to behave or present themselves in a certain way in order to live up to these expectations. The reasons why many want to keep their front stage and backstage separate are numerous, but they all come down to one main point - people want to look good for those who are paying them attention, just as actors want to put on a good performance for their audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCES\nCrossman, Ashley. \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.\" ThoughtCo, Aug. 27, 2020, thoughtco.com/the-presentation-of-self-in-everyday-life-3026754.\nCole, Nicki Lisa, Ph.D. \"Goffman's Front Stage and Back Stage Behavior.\" ThoughtCo, Feb. 16, 2021, thoughtco.com/goffmans-front-stage-and-back-stage-behavior-4087971.\nTedeschi, J.

        "text": "4851\nWho Are We In Society?\n\tDurkheim\u2019s theory of the collective consciousness explains that within a society, there is a sort of unspoken set of beliefs, values, behaviors, patterns, and other likenesses that set the expectations and guide life for its members. They are universally accepted and play a huge role in the formation of individual identities as well. Such a strong force of cohesion provides peace and tranquility, and also purpose for the people. Such beliefs can then be sort of divided into smaller categories and identities, creating even more intricate groups and communities. For example, you may be a part of a specific religious group with others who share very specific ideas with you. However, there is also a larger presence of religious belief in society altogether and a (somewhat) mutual respect of those groups. Solidarity is found in likeness and we achieve a sense of comfort by surrounding ourselves with those who either reflect or support or roles in society. We interpret these roles by understanding them in the context of the collective consciousness that we all share. This is made evident through archetypes.   We see many examples of the collective consciousness in all different aspects of life. Things as simple as what we consider to make a person \u201cwell mannered,\u201d our senses of humor, what emotions we assign to what connotation\u2026 These are all things that have a very specific interpretation to all of us because of their existence in our society\u2019s collective consciousness. Another huge influence on what exists in that consciousness is social institutions. Simply being a member of a country alone gives you a very strong sense of identity that you share with everyone around you. On top of that, politics create even more opportunities for unity and shared opinion. News, popular, and social media set the stage for how we should look, talk, and act and we all undoubtedly find ourselves attempting to conform to that. Law enforcement and the justice system create expectations for not only our behavior but our morality, influencing how we act every single day and how we consequently judge others for acting. Simply put, we accept the truths of society, whatever they may be, simply because everyone else does. What holds value to others then holds value to us. The collective consciousness is such a simple thing to achieve, but such a strong tie that glues people together without any question of why. \n\tThis sort of blind acceptance can be explained by Fligstein and MacAdams\u2019 idea of the existential function of the social. Their theory provides that the \u201csocial\u201d or a society/group of some sort creates activity that creates meaning, resulting in meaning in people\u2019s lives. Basically, without others, we would be meaningless, but in a like-minded group, we create value for ourselves and others. Without the role that we provide to others, we view ourselves as having no purpose. A collective belief about the role we play in a problem that is also a problem to other people makes us a significant player in that problem, therefore giving meaning to the people involved. Also, by people choosing a problem to work on collectively, it then assigns value to that problem simply because we choose it to. It could be something that we may usually have deemed insignificant, or unimportant in the grand scheme of things, but once society or a group holds it as so, it becomes of the utmost importance. We as humans essentially define our beliefs ourselves, and whatever we tell ourselves is important, it absolutely is. Sports are a great example of this. As an average person with no money invested or potential for personal gain from the outcome of a football game, it seems as if there should be no devout investment in the outcome. However, team rivalries and the passion for the game is one of the strongest pieces of identity that you may find in a lot of American households. This ability to give ourselves, our actions and interests, and others significant meaning is extremely powerful because it allows for people to explicitly shape our societies. People participate in practices that correlate to those beliefs then validate them and start to form groups that unite around the shared identity of stakeholding interest in that specific ideal.\n\tThese two theories both offer very strong insight into how societies are formed and how beliefs become set. Durkheim explains that everyone shares an identical understanding at the core which is how we form societies, and Fligstein and MacAdams explain that our significance comes from other people. Essentially, they both rely on the principle of fitting in. We do what others do and accept what others think as being true. We allow the ideas of others to become our own and let them shape our identities without any hesitation. The fear of being different then the group ultimately leads us to become one of the group, making the group and their beliefs that much stronger. The group is society, and the habit of following along as others do creates a very strong foundation of beliefs, morals, and expectations that we all share. While we do have individual significance, it is explained that you don\u2019t mean anything without what you mean to others, and therefore, other people and external factors have the biggest influence on your identity. While we may think that we have our own personalized values, society shows us that it's all a game of follow the leader, whether that be for better or for worse. ",

        "text": "Mental Health Degradation: The Effect of Extensive Social Media Use \n\tSocial contact, an intrinsic aspect of human existence, has been changed forever. Traditional human soapily contact has been recorder throughout history and is often see in the context of rituals and cultural experiences. While traditional roles have and always will be a staple in society, the creation of social media has drastically affected the behaviors that humans express in social settings. Social media was intended to foster more close-knit relationships and robust social structures, yet through research as startling discovery is found. Social media is diminishing the mental health of its users, especially the younger and emerging adult populations. Mental health issues such as Depressive Disorders , General Anxiety, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, High-Risk Sexual Activities, and addictive behaviors are all exacerbated through the use of social media. What was once a tool to bring global sociology to the individual scale, is now creating an insurmountable mental health pandemic. \n This also mirrors the class discussion on the stage that people present themselves on. The social media is used constantly and that\u2019s provided a new stage for users to present themselves on, but they tend to be more socially anxious when removed from social media. Other studies have been performed in similar fashion, over a brow scale of participants and have found very similar results as states previously. (Shensa, Sidani, Dew, Escobar-Viera, & Primack, 2018) This means that the idea that anxiety and anxiety disorders are dire results of extended social media use, is being proven consistently. In conjunction with general anxiety, social anxiety has also been researched respect to its correlation with social media use. Research shows that altho social media was intended to foster community and group cooperation, it has resulted in an innately for users to feel comfortable in a live setting when interacting with other humans. Females were specifically found to feel more anxious on average over their male counterparts and also felt as if their privacy was a significant concern on social media. (Alkis, Kadirhan, & Sat, 2017) This is extremely detrimental to cultural ties and society in general, where real-life is a constant reality what all must be able to navigate without the help of social media. Privacy is no longer a mutual respect, and physical relationships are imperative to humanity\u2019s existence. Social media has been found to risk that reality. \n\tAnother risk that extends past social medias risk to society itself, is that social media may be linked to behavior and mental disorders that rick the health of its users. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and the broad topic of body image issues, is a growing issue in the social media realm. BDD is typically characterized by the following habits and/or symptoms: perfectionist tendencies, belief that the subject had unseen defects in appearance, social situation avoidance, constant grooming or cosmetic hiding habits, etc. (2019) What this disorder does is target how individuals perceive themselves among the group, particularly in how they physically appear. The very nature of social media is that users post photos of themselves and activities they perform in order to gain recognition. This has proven to be destructive in many cases, where users become entrapped in the false idea that everyone else in their feed or their life looks a certain way or has certain physical attributes. This is where body image comes into the scene. Time and time again, body-shaming and buying n the rounds of physical appearance is an all too common occurrence. Naturally, the more time users spend on social media, the more they come into contact with this occurrence. Adolescence in particular have been targeted by social media use, and express heightened body dysmorphia in general. (Behm-Morawitz & Lewallen, 2016) This issue is not as common in real-life where there is a far greater array of body types, shapes, and sizes and none of which are put on a social pedestal quite like social media. Women have been the target of anti-body dysmorphia campaigns that aim to defeat the hard reality that social media promotes, but men are often forgotten. Studies have been conducted, where men are affected in a very similar way to women in this realm. (Hobza, Walker, Yakushko, & Peugh, 2007) Social media has no boundaries where users can hide or de-categorize themselves. BDD and body image issues will continue to be a great concern and a great downfall in modern social media history. \n\tBody Dysmorphic Disorder has recently been highlights by social media stars and the media alike, however, darker and more dangerous complimentary issue is high-risk sexual behavior. High-Risk Sexual Activity (HRSA) has begun to emerge as a result of extensive social media use by teen and younger adults. Some examples of HRSA include, unprotected sex (oral/anal/vaginal), multiple sex partners, sex before the age of 18, sex work, and others. (Healthwise Staff, 2020) All of these activities pose a significant threat to young adults that are captivated by social media trends and subsequently normalized potentially dangerous activities. One study specifically looked into the affects that social media has on Latino populations in this context. Researchers found that a significant portion of subjects actively \u201csexted\u201d boyfriends or girlfriends on a regular basis. Parental oversight of social media use was found to not only lower the risk for HRSA such as sexting, but all restore normal family function. (Landry, Turner, Vyas, & Wood, 2017) In this case, the Latino culture was a specific concern but this can be used for cross-cultural analysis in a sociological context. In a more broad study, researchers found that not only text messaging but social media had a specific impact on the extremely high percentage of young adults (15-24 yrs) that report contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Young adults make up an all-time high of 48% of all cases. (Jones, Eathington, Baldwin, & Sipsma, 2014) When viewed in the context that social media influencers are pushing sexually based agendas and promiscuity to gan recognition, this is to be the expected result.  Every beyond a correlation, there is a causative effect with exposure to sexual content on social media and participation in HRSA. (Bleakley, Hennessey, Fishbein, & Jordan, 2008) The issue with social media in this sense is that it is giving particularly vulnerable populations access to content that thy would otherwise be unable to access. This is causing a sharp incline in risky behavior and has spiked rates of STDs and STIs across the globe. Not only is this an epidemic among developed countries, but this is a pandemic and is on track to influence human culture and group behavior overall. \n\tIn a cascade of negative effects that social media has on mental health, the nagging result that is often overlooked by its users is addiction. Addiction, whether that be to HRSA, body image, or to social media itself. Addiction in the form of social media overuse, constantly checking ones phone for notifications or new social media posts, and abusing time spent on social media to the point where it impedes everyday life. (Hilliard, 2021) This addiction extends to other addictive habits scubas substance abuse. Substance abuse has been linked to social media, where groups that promote addictive behavior with illicit substances are found. Moreover, the simple act of posting about substance abuse may normalize its existence and result in addictive behavior in the future. (Kim et al., 2017) College students as a sub culture of the human race are experiencing heightened issues with addictive behavior. College in general is an open door to substances and experiences that are often unique to the college experience. Parties, clubbing, and diverse friendships have a new dynamic who social media is introduces. (D\u2019Arienzo, Boursier, & Griffiths, 2019) Social media accounts highlighting such scenes to college students normalizes potentially detrimental social practices and when combined with addiction to social media itself, may result in addiction to substances and the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). This goes back the self-esteem issue earlier, where self-esteem is lower with extended social media use and results in addiction to the positive feedback loop that social media employs. This takes time away from studying for exams and leads to a general decimation of college grades and self-efficacy. (Hou, Xiong, Jiang, Song, & Wang, 2019) This too is a pandemic that extends to a global scale. Populations of college students an young adults are faced with defeating addictions to trends or social media itself. This undoubtedly affects future generations, and may end up affecting groups of people that are surrounded with substance abuse issues due to low socioeconomic status. \n\tThe mental health crisis the world is facing today has always existed throughout human history. The change in how mental health is viewed has largely been exposed through modern media coverage and through social media use. The negative effects of social media use are costly, and have resulted in global outcry for research on remedies to the problems it can create. From depression and anxiety, to BDD and addiction; social media presents a significant challenge to vulnerable populations. Teens and young adults are the most notable, however, any population or group of people that overuses social media is at risk for the variety of factors presented above. As social media continues to grow into new facets of human life and social structures, a significant uptick in mental health issues will be experiences. If humans have survived through tens of thousands of years with traditional social structures and behaviors, will the exponentially growing invasion of social media into life itself finally drive mankind mad? \nReferences \n\nAalbers, G., Fried, E., De Wit, S., Hereen, A., &amp; Richard, M.

        "text": "Graded Essay #3\t\n\tEvery society has its detrimental aspects. What seems to nag Western society is the relationship that workers have with the work they perform. Society can often times be overly individualistic and too focussed on material wealth, that many people forget the rewards that their work can ultimately yield: fulfillment. I believe that Marx was right in that there is a general, unnatural relationship that is promoted within work and life. That is facilitated by bureaucracy, and exploited by economic gate-keepers. It is a sad reality, but it can be fixed by finding the true nature and rewards of work and Capitalism which is so often forgotten. Twenty-five to  thirty years is a long relationship, so it ought to be a healthy one. ",

        "text": "Sociology 105\n22 April 2021\nThe Imbalanced Power in America\n\tAs society in America grows and is constantly evolving, the dominance that individual people hold remains uniform. If you asked a random stranger on the street if they were to describe someone who has the most powerful socioeconomic status, they would describe a white heterosexual man. Why is that the immediate answer that the majority of people come to? What is the relationship between social class, financial class, and racial class? When did this power system start? The prejudice that people have toward other minority groups forms a caste system that is equal to the power that they hold. This system forms groups that tend to band together because of similar social status that they share. Social ques and day-to-day encounters are present in all environments that show that there is an unequal distribution of power amongst racial groups. Many have researched this concept and have found that racialization is collectively formed by individuals who discriminate against other groups that are below them. In this paper, I will talk about the discrimination against minority groups and address how it negatively affects the opportunities people will have in their lives.\n\tIn module four of class, we talked about race vs. ethnicity and the difference between the two. Race, being a top-down process where a dominant group utilizes their power to give meaning to a specific group. Ethnicity, being a bottom-up process where a specific group had a uniform identity formed by the history of their region. Specifically, Omni and Winant\u2019s \u201cRacial Formations\u201d, talks about the idea of how being a person of color has changed its\u2019 meaning through time. Through their research they developed the concept that the meaning of an individual\u2019s race is constructed by someone that is at the top of this social caste. Over time this has evolved into racism, serotypes and microaggressions, which has left prejudice against minority groups in modern society.\n\tSociety as a whole understands that racialization is formed predominantly involuntary in most situations. The point of interest is when this prejudice or classification towards groups of specific people start. An experiment was done with primary school students which aimed to prove that instinctively they have already racialized all of society. In the study, children were asked to class depictions of families on who they think is the wealthiest and which one they would want to live with. The four families drawn were, a business-working family, a middle-class working family, an intellectual looking family, and a working-class family. All are white heterosexual families. Within these families, the clothes that each person had on ranged from business suits to casual wear for the adults and respectively for the children. \n\tThe results were not surprising as ninety-five percent of children guessed that the business working family made the most money and they wanted to live with them the most. The working-class family was the family they were least likely to live with, given the choice. \u201cThe fact that young children already demonstrate master of such schemata, on the basis of a limited social trajectory and, indeed, even before lengthy formal education and the development of literacy, suggests other sources than the direct experience of class inequality and cross-class interactions.\u201d. (Vandebroeck) It is amazing how children can pick up on these things without anyone telling them the average salary for people that wear business suits to work. In correspondence to race, this study was only done with white families, if the study was done with black families would they be ranked lower than the working-class families? To further explain this, children are already aware of the social caste that they are put in. It is evident that they know who holds more power and money within the groups of solely the white families. Adding black families into the experiment would result in having the white working-class families, higher on the scale.\n\tIn the experiment that Vandebroeck, conducted it not only showed that children are already aware of the social caste, but they are also aware of the advantages of living with the white business-class family. Focusing more on how the white business family got to the top of list, can be explained by \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d by Peggy McIntosh. Simply put, McIntosh illuminates that white privilege is the system where white people have unearned benefits exclusively because of their skin color. In society today, it is evident that white communities are better funded, whereas black communities are underfunded. This being said, white people have a better chance at education, job opportunities, and quality of life, immensely proportional to those of black communities. A specific example would be the difference between private and public schools. The majority of students enrolled at private schools are white, why is that? White families, because of the privilege they have, are more able to afford to send their kids to private schools because they were born into families that did the same for them. The process repeats itself over and the children will have more opportunities for jobs which will recycle into the production of more revenue.\n\tWhite people can use the privilege that they have to change the system and help equalize the opportunity that black people lack. Today, movements such as Black Lives Matter, show efforts specifically in trying to eliminate and exemplify racial discrimination. White privilege is associated with \u2018White guilt\u2019 which is the concept that white people are starting to recognize the privilege they have and try to take action against injustices. Research was done on youth adults that show white guilt is a motivator to take action, yet at the same time if it were low social responsibility there would be less action. \u201cFuture research investigation the link between White guilt and civic action should pay close attention to measures of civic engagement that differentiate between all forms civic engagement and social-justice related action.\u201d (Dull) This being said, someone who identifies white privilege does not mean they will take social-justice action because many are absent in civic engagement. Furthermore, this explains white privilege even better because they have the opportunity yet choose to not engage because it does not directly relate to them. \n\tIn response to this study, it can be found that there is a correlation between white people and racism. Although indirect, white people can only benefit from the social placement they are put in. Placed at the top of the social caste means that they have hidden opportunities that they are not aware of. In this social structure only certain groups of people are granted privilege, where you get half the privilege of the social structure preceding you. This goes so on and so on taking into the account of race, gender and sexual orientation, until you get to the very bottom of the pyramid. While privilege comes naturally, the lower you are \u2018ranked\u2019 the more you are affected by the privilege of the latter. The distribution of this power by categorizing individuals by what they were born into is called the \u201cMatrix of Domination\u201d\n\tIn module four, as a class we read an excerpt from Patricia Hill Collins, \u2018Black Feminist Thought\u2019, which talks about the matrix of domination and the effects it has on oppressed individuals. As we studied Collins, we discovered that within the matrix of domination an individual will become ingrained into their social order and become an agent to the process. She explains that what defines these levels can be a multitude of different things including, race, gender, sexuality, cultures, nations, etc. For the United States, from the birth of the country in 1776, the matrix began and has stayed present sociologically to present day. Specifically, it is evident that the Matrix of Domination is evident through education institutions, media, churches and markets. These manifest into the dominant point of interest and everything else is seen as foreign. What makes these standards is one group which is at the top of the matrix, resulting in racism, microaggressions, and attacks on everyone that does not fit the standard at the top of the matrix.\n\tThe most important factor that Collins describes it that through this social hierarchy; everyone has an advantage or disadvantage, not just over the color of your skin, but also your gender. In terms of color, individuals who are lighter skinned will have the most power. In terms of gender, men will always be ranked higher over women every time. The white male will remain at as the foundation of power because it has been fused into society. Another point of interest is that whenever a group tries to relegate a topic for reform, it directly affects another group. This is shown when Collins talks about how white woman urge for female rights in the workplace, where a lot of black woman were working, by which would lower their power. Further pushing the point when a shift happens at the top of the matrix it becomes a domino effect, toppling down the levels of power. \n\tTo better understand the matrix of domination, examining Donald Trump\u2019s first election highlights how and why people, specifically people of color, were scared. In the 2016 election Trump attracted the votes from the majority of the white working class. He conformed to what the white working class wanted in a candidate, in response to that collectively they felt as if they were losing power as a class. These class \u2018anxieties\u2019 are a huge deception and become politicized off the fact that in reality that equality was becoming present not only in the workplace, but the media and the public. These voters became selfish and looked only at notions the ex-president made to help better their class, paying no attention to how the black community would be affected. This directly alters the matrix of domination by shifting the power that the black community were slowly gaining. Trump\u2019s election made it difficult for many groups of people because the matrix conformed them into an even more state of preference by white people.\n\tEduardo Bonilla-Silva, a sociologist from Duke-University, deeper analyzed the effects of the Trump election through a sociological lens. He concluded that racism has returned a more \u201cold-fashioned\u201d (Bonilla-Silva), in return has formed more activist groups to combat them. Although Trump had huge negative effects on the racial issue in the United States it forced different groups of people to band together. In essence, shifting the power within the \u201cMatrix of Domination\u201d, so that there will be a more equal level that is inclusive. \u201cWe must become sociologically driven citizens concerned with building a more democratic, inclusive, and just society.\u201d(Bonilla-Silva) Eduardo creates a statement to establish urgency in the dying democracy that we live in today. Society in America is fading away from democracy because there is real no change in power, thus no change in societal issues. Taking Eduardo\u2019s warning to heart will cure America of the disease we have put it through, yet at the same time lessening the power of the \u201cMatrix of Domination\u201d\n\tIn conclusion, racism as a whole has baked into society to the point where it has become a norm which can\u2019t be escaped from. It is seen all over the media, schools, and tv shows where black people are often portrayed as bad, and white people are seen as good. One of the products of this is that black communities are often underfunded and do not have the opportunities that white people would otherwise get. This sets off into an eternal loop of generations where families are stuck in their class which limits their power in society. In turn, this bands people of similar treatment together creating levels of belonging where they feel most accepted. To truly abolish racism, society as a whole must break these levels and must rebuild an inclusive society that accepts individuals for who they are. \n\t\n\t\nWorks Cited:\n\nBonilla-Silva, Eduardo (02/2019). \"\u201cRacists,\u201d \u201cClass Anxieties,\u201d Hegemonic Racism, and Democracy in \nTrump\u2019s America\".\u00a0Social currents\u00a0p. 14.

        "text": "               THE CONCEPT OF RELIGION\n\nReligion has a great and powerful influence in today\u2019s society and always have for many years. A society formed by strong shared origins in religion can be a powerful unity if it wants to be. Religion was introduced in the first human society and has remained a part of human society ever since. Religion in some way defines individuals and gives them characteristics be ever discovered, it can be either positive or negative. I was inspired to do more research about religious concepts after reading the neurology of religion. It differentiates religion and culture. In class, we talked about the start of religion and what led to the expansion. Which has a huge impact on Race too because they kind of go hand-in-hand. You cannot talk about the origin of religion and not bring in \u201crace\u201d because every religion started within a specific environment with the same kind of people. There are more chances of them agreeing on a specific belief than a diverse community. \nAmerican religion missionaries\u2019 determination led them to other continents of the world, where do you make the word of God known to many. African-Americans were are highly known achieved in forming their churches, calling in the memberships, which increase the spread of Christianity.  Enslavement of Africans and their descendants, as well as captured Native Americans, demonstrated the power of white Europeans and they used slavery as an economical profit. African descendants changed and adjusted their belief systems to local conditions and rules of the white man. Christian religious groups performed an influential role, and most tried to impose strict religion on slaves.\n Now when we look at the different types of beliefs people have, this just clarifying how opinionated and unnecessary religious people became. Let\u2019s first start with the beliefs of atheists and agnostics, that there is or is not a god, and ethics do not necessarily matter. So are they a religion? The concept of religion can be very hard and tricky. Most people are familiar with different kinds of religion. The most critical part is when people basically share the same concept but have different ways of going about it. Most of us would say that agnostics are not because we view religion as something that has something to do with God. New Age is sometimes called a religion, but in reality, they embrace whatever appeals to them the most and add them to an existing religious order. We claim certain religions and we don\u2019t even practice them right at the end of the day. Is it because religion creates a sense of community and some people join a religion in order to feel included in a smaller subsection of a larger society. We see that a lot in society nowadays, and I don\u2019t even blame religious people when they get offended by that. That\u2019s a very high level of disrespect in my opinion. Not all societies offer religious freedom, with some countries demanding the practice of one religion and others going to war to create a religious dominance. \nHowever, for American society and other societies that allow religious freedom, the ability to practice a religion when and where someone likes helps to protect other freedoms, such as speech and expression. This gives some people the wrong expression of religious practices. Most people choose certain beliefs because they fit better with their societies and others don\u2019t even have that choice. They have to live with that burden and sadness until they gain freedom from their superiors. Talking from an Islamic perspective, modern freedom doesn\u2019t exactly line up with their religious perspective. People find out new things about them every day. Today\u2019s societies gave youths the right to change whatever they are unhappy about since it\u2019s their life. I\u2019m in full support of human rights and the \u201cit\u2019s your body your choice\u201d saying. But when it comes to religions, they have their own teachings and that\u2019s what defines and differentiates them. I feel like once claim a religion you have to try to obey and go with their teachings because you choose them. At least for some people. The people who gain body or gender freedom in America most like have no problems with religious freedom. For example, In Islam, it\u2019s been said in their Holy book that homosexuality is prohibited and every practicing Muslim is aware of that. To a point where they are even scared to talk about it. That was before,  it\u2019s now becoming coming where people defy a specific religious belief and imply \u201cfreedom\u201d. That\u2019s just disrespectful to the believers. If you totally go again a religious belief it\u2019s fair that you shouldn\u2019t claim them, because you are going against part of their own practices. \nMany people have voices in religions, others often feel more entitled than the rest. Genders are given different roles, and they are mostly unfair in most people\u2019s eyes. It takes a true believer to accept all the rules give and not even ask questions. Most ways don\u2019t comply with today\u2019s society. Negotiations are even implied at some point because of the power that women have now. There was nothing like women being breadwinners in a family, but now that\u2019s a given right. You still have communities who are against this. They claim that they still go by the old ways. Let\u2019s take a look at feminists, they are here to give women rights they deserve but they never have. In order for them to get what they really aspire they have to go against most people, religious people to be specific. Feminism is viewed negatively by most individuals. They target the least talk about topics that trigger entitled individuals. Women are really strong and really needed in societies. The way most religions explain how they were created compared to men is really degrading. It makes other women feel less of themselves and praise men for being considered superior. The media plays role in almost all we do in life. Especially now that they can be used for the promotional cause. Islam is now experiencing a high conversion rate because the believers started to demonstrate the religion to people through the media. Although it\u2019s somehow encouraging discrimination. Other religions are feeling type of way about their people converting to other religions. Women in religions are using social media platforms to get their points across the world.\n The dominance of males is only part of the problem. They are thought to act in certain ways which they learn from men around them. That\u2019s why men raised by women tend to have more respect for women around them. Because they are not seeing those dominant privileges, they are used to seeing women strived and do what they had to do for survival. Women are easily satisfied, that\u2019s how they are created. They are always good with the little stuff. That\u2019s it took them a long time to go against men's rights. \nReligion is a source of power and strength for believers at a time when they feel down or defeated by events that happened to them. It\u2019s like a light that helps you get through difficult situations in life when you feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore. It provides moral guidelines for individuals and families, that some religious believers sustain marriages to maintain the family. Most religions layout ideas for marriage, including beliefs against divorce and adultery and responsibilities for the man and woman. It often helps people believe that their lives have a purpose and gives them direction and meaning, which benefits one\u2019s health, mental health to be precise. Some people\u2019s religious beliefs are the source of the courage they need to keep going in life. Now suicidal rates are really. Most believers failed to commit because of what their religions say about it. They mostly decided to forgive and wait for their God to fight their battles for them.  Like when they say  (\u201cThe Lord is my strength\u201d). This gives people the courage to keep pushing and that they are not alone. \nMost people want to believe that there is more to reality than just the physical, scientific universe, and religion teaches us that indeed, there is. In the early ages of the religious book talked about how and the universe is like. But barely anyone believed. Now that technology is advanced they\u2019ve seen most of it. The religious view that \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d just confirms that believers have strong feelings about God. Religion allows people to believe they\u2019ve been forgiven when they feel regret and remorse over things they\u2019ve done wrong. It can help people come to terms with their own faults and shortcomings and it teaches us to focus on what really matters, rather than worldly success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \nw2b6b, and Name. \u201cThe Role of Religion in Today's Society.\u201d JournalNow, 23 Feb. 2021, journalnow.net/the-role-of-religion-in-todays-society/. \n\"The Negative Effects of Religion on Society.\" The Unbounded Spirit. 14 Aug. 2020.

        "text": "9487\nAlienation as a Product of Rationalization\nAlienation is a relatively new concept in human history. For the majority of our existence as a species, humans existed for a purpose. In our labor and work experience, we have felt connected to what we are doing, and the products produced by our labor. Our societies were not so focused on production, but rather survival. However, since the onset of the industrial revolution, humans have shifted to become a resource rather than a producer. The industrial revolution brough the introduction of rationalization. The movement towards a society that is more efficient, calculable, and predictable. This has caused humans to become detached from their work, as they only see a part of the process to the product. This essay will cover how alienation has derived from the shift to a more rationalized society.\nAlienation started to become a concept with the introduction of industrialization. When the industrial revolution came into effect, people were not valued as much for their skills, but for their labor. Just their ability to work and create a product or a piece of said product. For example, factory workers. When factories were first implemented, they of course needed workers. However, they did not need specialized skills. So, men came to work in factories, but the work was not enjoyable. It did not help that labor laws were not yet invented, so the workplace was likely dangerous, as well as alienating. The reason jobs like these are alienating is because you get no say in what you would like to do. Given a required task and told to complete it. This caused the beginnings of alienation. Workers were starting to be seen as a resource of labor, rather than something of value.\nThe industrial revolution is a prime example of rationalization. It is the very beginnings of the concept. Societies began to move towards consumerism. This shift required products to be produced at an increasing rate and speed. This meant the necessity of a more predictable product, which would be similar or the same after each production. Assembly lines are a good example of rationalization. They produce the same exact item each time, at each station. They also cause the workers who are a part of them to feel more alienated from their job. The job an individual partakes in might be a pillar of one's self, in today\u2019s world, as well as in past eras. The reduction of the job as meaning to an individual may cause them to feel alienated from it. \nAs societies have become more rationalized and more geared towards being as efficient as possible, alienation has become more widespread. This is especially seen in capitalist economies, such as the United States. Large industries and corporations with tens of thousands of employees have taken rationalization and extracted it to its truest form. Making their products and companies as efficient and predictable as possible. To do this, however, the same is required of their employees, which are quite abundant. \nTo do this, employers give employees specific tasks and guidelines which they cannot break. For example, factory or warehouse workers follow very exact schedules and rules. They often do not even see the final product of what they work towards. This may cause workers to become detached from their job. They are only being seen by large industries as sources of labor, and are not as cared for as in the past. Rationalization practiced by many large corporations has created alienation, especially in today\u2019s world. Corporations such as Amazon, Walmart, and McDonalds are all examples of forerunners of rationalization. Amazon warehouses are another great example of rationalization, and resulting alienation of employees. Warehouses have very set rule, time clocks, conveyor belts, etc, which all run in a certain way for maximum efficiency. It is necessary for the company to survive and continue to make a massive profit. The workers, in some cases, do not feel like they matter in their job. Yes, they earn a living, however they may find no meaning in their work outside of money. Because humans want to have purpose and work, doing something you don\u2019t want to do for someone else, for a product you will never see, can be detrimental. \nIn conclusion, the continual shift and leaning into rationalization over the past several hundred years has brought forth more alienation in our capitalistic society. Starting from the industrial revolution, and the introduction of the extraction of labor from humans to today, which is a more refined version of this. Because much of our society has become so focused on efficiency and max productivity, alienation is a common byproduct. It had not been seen as frequently or at all in previous societies, because each laborer existed for their purpose. Stonemasons, blacksmiths, textile workers, artisans, all had a certain purpose and a role to fill. Today, with a very consumer-based economy, the focus is on products. Rationalization is the best way to produce products. Many laborers do not see their final product, which may cause them to be alienated from their job, which can really only be seen in more modern western societies.\n\n",

        "text": "Graded Essay 2\t\n\n\tMcIntosh picked up where Omi and Winant left off. She sought to explore the idea of white privilege and social superiority of Whites in modern society. She argued that much like male privilege, white privilege is the product of denying the existence of a social hierarchy that was set up in the distant past. Much like the abuse of Natives by White settlers, McIntosh argues that the prevalent social reinforcers are here to stay and are consistently used as a political tool. She also proposed the idea of the hierarchy being a result of Whites not acknowledging their inadvertent oppression of non-Whites. She seems to advocate for educating Whites on their elevated status as to aid them in realizing that they are privileged. Her early research into this topic suggests that racism and lower-class mentalities are a direct result of centuries of white superiority.  Where Omi and Winant focus on the historical perspective of racial issues, McIntosh is more interested in the current state of these issues and their qualifying parameters. \n\tModern thought and discussion revolving around race relations and the formation of races that we see today is an ongoing process of research and deliberation. The results of these particular formations have long-standing impacts on human social norms and play a role in nearly every facet of human life. From the economy to cultural statistics, there seems to be a distinct difference in each race\u2019s human experience. What those core differences are and why they exist are socially reinforced is a debate with many unanswered questions. Omi and Winant made substantial headway in researching a possible origin of these race formations, while McIntosh shared her opinion on what modern implications are with political reinforcement. With research and discussion such as this, the modern world has a substantial probability of improving overall race relations and fixing disparities, due to a deeper understanding in humanity\u2019s races.
