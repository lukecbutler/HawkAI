        "text": "Relationships Are Everything\n\tHow important are the people you surround yourself with? The answer is quite simple, actually. They are everything. Relationships shape who we are and influence our very way of thinking. The people around us have a bigger impact than we think, and it is important that we recognize this. The ones we love and care about affect us personally and greatly. It is almost as if they are an extension of ourselves, a part of us. What they do and say will affect us, whether we like it or not. When we care about people, their feelings become our own and therefore, have the ability to drastically change our lives. Following this idea, we also have to notice how we feel about ourselves. It holds extreme importance because it ultimately comes from how we think others perceive us. Both recognizing that the people we love are an extension of ourselves, and knowing that our perceptions of ourselves are defined by how we think others see us, are of dire importance in leading a healthy life. \n\tI never really had any strong relationships growing up. I was raised by a single mother, with random boyfriends, and one fianc, coming in and out of the house over the years. My sister and I were always alone or at our grandparents. My grandfather was probably my favorite person on earth when I was younger, and he always made me feel safe and understood. Sadly, he passed when I was twelve and with his departure, the only consistent man I ever had in my life was gone. As I grew older, my sister was the only person on earth I trusted and felt safe with. She was everything and she still is to this day. I of course had friends in my childhood, but none ever felt as genuine or natural as I thought they should have. Admittedly though, I wasn't mature enough to develop them anyway. I never saw how much I was missing or that my mom's ways of thinking were so incredibly vicious. I truly didn't pay much attention to, or take time to notice these sorts of things when I was younger, and it wasn't until I got older that I realized how much the people in my life really affected me. \n\tIt all started in eighth grade, when I began to think for myself and discovered some harsh realities. I had recently moved schools and gotten to an age where I began to question almost everything. My curiosity and discoveries only increased in high school, and it had an enormous impact on how I am today. I realized how awful of a parent my mother was and how my upbringing caused me so many issues. I then became painfully aware of the fact that I did not have an adult figure in my life that I trusted and could rely on. This wrecked me the most and it still tortures me to this day. I had no one to follow as an example, no one to look up to or reassure me that things would turn out okay. How my mom thought and acted had slowly been bleeding onto me my entire life and it horrified me. I was so terrified that I would end up like her, judgmental and so perfectly unaware of the people around her. \n\tAbout halfway through high school I found some friends that would eventually become so much more. They showed me what love was supposed to look like and that DNA had no significance when I thought of family. I learned how important strong relationships are and what I had been missing out on this entire time. When I realized that these people actually valued me and my opinions, it made me feel more comfortable with myself. I began to grow with them and I learned how capable of love I really was. I realized that deep connections with people were something priceless to me and that I never wanted to live without them. I will forever be grateful for the lessons they taught me and the impact they had on my life. I feel whatever they feel and love them as if they are part of me.\n\tWilliam James explains that one of the constituent parts of the self is the material self. This includes things that matter to people, like their house, clothes, and family. The material self is an important piece in making up the self and envelops all the things a person truly cares about. An example is how wives often want their husbands to open up and explain their feelings to them. They do this because they care about their husbands' feelings as if they are their own. When people are connected so deeply, they become understood in a way that makes them part of each other. The material self holds an immense value because it helps shape people's identity. It claims ownership of what matters to you and makes that into a special fragment of your life. Ultimately, the people you love are an extension of yourself. \n\tCharles Cooley takes another similar approach but with something called the looking glass self. He explains it as the person you see looking back at you when you stare into a mirror. Our looking glass self is who we think others see when they are looking at us. This affects us by creating worry and curiosity. People are constantly concerned with how others see them. An example is going to a new school and walking into class for the first time. If the students all have a negative or strange reaction when they look at you then it will make you feel self-conscious and wonder what you did wrong. On the other hand, if everyone has a good reaction to your presence then you are likely to feel comfortable and content. How others act has a huge impact on us and our ability to be happy. The way we feel about ourselves comes from how you believe others perceive you.\n\tMy friends and sister are the main part of my material self. They mean the most to me out of anything on this planet and I do not feel whole without them. They have become a part of me, an extension of myself, and have infinitely impacted my personality. I think the way I do because of them and feel their feelings as if they are my own. I appreciate having learned about this topic because I always felt as if the people I love were something more than just friends, but never knew it had a name. The material self helps look at people and possessions in a new and deeper way than was capable prior to knowing about it. I love how it considers relationships as a part of my being rather than something separate. It brings a greater meaning to the people I love and conveys their endless value.\n\tWith the looking glass self, I can view all of my relationships differently. Whether it is with friends or family, it still reveals something that I wouldn't have known before. For my mom and childhood, it had a more negative impact on how I viewed myself. I had to deal with constant remarks and judgments from her and many others while growing up, which led me to have an overall bad perception of myself. I wish I could hug my younger self sometimes and tell her that it is okay. Because I thought the majority of people had a bad opinion on my personality and looks, I started to believe it myself. It wasn't until I got older and started to be surrounded by caring people, that I realized how wrong they were about me. My friends loved me for who I was and enjoyed being in my presence. I formed a better and more loving opinion of myself because of this, and I try to be patient with my looking glass self now because she deserves it.\n\tThe people we surround ourselves with are extremely important to our happiness. They shape how we view ourselves and become a part of us. The connections run deep and do affect our lives greatly. I had a negative view of myself when I was younger because of how I thought others perceived me and it would have stayed that way if I never met better people. I am so thankful to have them as a part of me now and I love them so. Thankfully as adults we are able to control who we surround ourselves with. It is so important to keep people close that are genuine and love you because it affects how you view yourself. Having strong connections with people holds immense value since they are an extension of who you are as a person. Relationships are the most beautiful thing about humans, and they should always be protected and cherished, as they are part of you. \n",

        "text": "Self-esteem issues and negative personal identity can be very problematic for people no matter age, race, gender, or sexuality. The negative effects of low self-esteem and a negative personal identity have the potential to reduce the quality of life dramatically of an individual suffering from these afflictions. People who suffer from low self-esteem often have trouble trying new things because of their increased self-doubt. These individuals also have low resilience to challenges presented in front of them because they do not have the confidence or courage that they can handle the task at hand. They may not feel the need to fully take care of themselves. Young people in particular are prone to suffering from low self-esteem because they are still forming a sense of identity and self-worth. Places such as middle schools and high schools can sometimes feel like you are falling into a sink hole. To counteract the negative effects that low self-esteem can have on individuals, young people must challenge their own assumptions of what other people think about them to regain confidence and not suffer the results of low self-esteem.\nThe way that I viewed myself in middle school and my first two years of high school (pre covid) was a lot lower than the way that I view myself now. During this time, I did not have a lot of confidence in myself for several reasons. In my head there was a hierarchy of popularity that held incredible significance to me. In this hierarchy, I was in the middle of the spectrum. I was not popular, but I was also not at the bottom where the weird kids resided. The perception of my lower position on the spectrum of popularity carried real weight and it lowered my self-esteem significantly. I presumed that other people glanced at me and concluded that I did not meet the high standard that only popular people could live up to. I assumed people did not think the way I looked or how I acted was cool. I thought that they thought that the way I interacted with them was uncool and weird. Another reason for my decreased level of confidence was my perception\nof my own abilities as a student. All my friends took advanced classes and were in the gifted program. The classes I took were honors, but they were not the really tough classes my peers were taking, and they made sure to pick fun of me.\n      When I was in 8th grade, I was taking all honors courses, except English. My friends would poke fun at me for taking a \"regular\" class and I would laugh along with them. The toll that this had on me was not huge, but it did lower my confidence in my abilities as a student slightly and this weighed into my overall lower self-esteem during this time. This combined with the perception of my rank on the popularity hierarchy resulted in myself not being able to gain a lot of confidence in myself and my abilities. I thought everything I did was subpar, and I was not at the level of my classmates. This lower perception of myself affected my confidence in my physical abilities and my social skills. I did not think I was adequately physically fit at the time and even to this day I find it hard to talk to people I respect because I think I do not have the adequate social skills to have a successful conversation with them. In other words, I think that they will think that I was bad at conversation, and they will look down on me for that.\n      Charles Cooley was the first person to coin the term the looking glass self. The concept of the looking glass self, according to Cooley, is that the ideas and feelings people have about themselves are developed in response to their perception and internalization of how others perceive and judge them. For example, let us say there is a teenage boy trying out for the basketball team. He comes into the first day of tryouts nervous and unsure of his abilities. During tryouts, he notices the coaches paying more attention to him and he sees a few players pointing at him and talking amongst themselves. He interprets this as a sign that the coaches and other players are impressed with his skills and that he would add value to the team. Because of this, he is motivated to play as best as possible so he can join the team. He entered the tryout nervous and\nunsure of his abilities, and then left the tryout more confident in his abilities and he now sees himself as a skilled basketball player.\n      In this example the teenage boy's perception of himself was altered based on how he thought others viewed him. The important distinction to take away from this is that people's assumptions about how other people perceive them can be accurate, but more importantly they can be incredibly inaccurate as well. For example, when a dancer is performing, she may look at the crowd's reaction and see that they are clapping and smiling. She interprets this as them thinking that she is a good dancer. However, in reality, everybody in the crowd thinks she is a bad dancer, they are only being respectful. The interpretation of somebody's assumptions to how other people think of them is highly unreliable and can skew their personal reality far from the objective truth.\n      The way I thought others perceived me in middle school and high school had no sound evidence or relevance to the objective truth of what they actually thought about me. I shouldn't have based my self-worth off my assumption of how other people thought about me because those assumptions could have been completely inaccurate. When my friends made fun of me for taking easier classes than they were, I interpreted this as them thinking that I am actually less intelligent and cannot handle the workload of a higher-level class. Knowing what I know today, the assumption I made of my friends thinking I was less intelligent was completely false because they explained to me that it was false a few years ago. Even though my assumptions of my friend's beliefs towards my intelligence were wrong, it still had a dramatic impact on my self- esteem and overall ability to reach my full potential in school at that time. Understanding Cooley's concept allows people to realize the mechanism behind how their self-image and self-\n\nesteem is created. This can give power to individuals by gaining control over the way their sense of self is realized.\n      The negative effects that come with low self-esteem have a dramatic impact on people's mental health. Charles Cooley's concept of the looking glass mirror explains how people sometimes allow inaccurate interpretations of other people's views and feelings towards them decrease their self-esteem. In middle school and high school, my full potential was not reached because I allowed false assumptions about my intelligence and my popularity, diminish my confidence. This newfound lens can allow people to challenge these inaccurate assumptions and realize that what they assume other people think of them could be false. Along with this, practicing increased self-worth and self-appreciation can allow people to build their self-esteem and become confident with their abilities and actions to reach their full potential.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Beauty Standards \n\n      We've all scrolled through social media. Most young women spend multiple hours a day immersed in the alternate reality the algorithm has created for consumers. This algorithm particularly preys and capitalizes on fear and insecurity. Have you ever scrolled through social media, only to find yourself feeling less than perfect in comparison to the flawless images on display? This feeling, driven by the endless stream of seemingly flawless photos, has become a common problem in today's society. This paper aims to show how the idea of \"The Beauty Myth,\" as explained by Naomi Wolf, can offer a sociological perspective to better understand and make sense of the unattainable beauty standards promoted by social media platforms.\n      In my life and the lives of others, I have noticed the harmful effects of social media on self-confidence and body image. From friends sharing their insecurities to countless posts advocating unrealistic beauty ideals, the pressure to be perfect is evident. The widespread presence of these images and their impact on people's self-worth presents a puzzle that can be examined through the lens of Wolf's \"The Beauty Myth.\" \n      One day, while studying in Randall with my best friend, we decided to take a break and catch up on each other's lives. As we were talking, she pulled out her phone to check her social media. She was scrolling through Instagram when I noticed her expression change, and a sadness washed over her. I asked her what was wrong, but she just shrugged it off, saying it was nothing. I couldn't help but notice that my friend became quieter and more withdrawn after that moment. I knew she had encountered something on social media that had affected her. Finally, after a bit of gentle prodding, she admitted that she had seen photos of influencers promoting an unattainable body image. The images made her feel insecure about her own appearance and fueled her self-doubt. \n      It's really profound how immediate and deep an impact a screen can affect a human being. Something that is so obviously fake, can influence our emotions on a serious level. These algorithms are specifically designed to make you feel a certain way. To garner your attention, and there is no intention within it that is good. On a moral level, there is no reality where this predation is acceptable. \n      This instance highlighted how the unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by social media, as described by Naomi Wolf's \"The Beauty Myth,\" could have immediate and profound effects on individuals like Sarah. Her self-confidence was shaken, and she began questioning her self-worth, wondering if she wasn't attractive enough to be valued by society. \n      Naomi Wolf's idea of \"The Beauty Myth\" suggests that society's beauty standards are an oppressive force, maintained to keep women under control. According to Wolf, these standards are impossible to achieve and always changing, making sure women continuously strive for an ideal they can never truly reach. To better understand this concept, think about the fashion industry's promotion of extremely thin models as the ultimate beauty standard in the 1990s. This ideal was then replaced by a more athletic and toned appearance in the 2000s, leaving women trying to adapt to the new standard.\n      Using Wolf's concept of \"The Beauty Myth,\" we can now analyze the effects of social media on beauty standards and self-esteem. The constant flood of images on social media platforms, often digitally edited or filtered, strengthens the idea that perfection is achievable. This false belief increases the pressure to fit into these unrealistic standards, leaving people feeling not good enough and always chasing an unattainable goal. Moreover, social media algorithms often keep this cycle going by promoting content that aligns with these beauty ideals, reinforcing the myth's power.\n      Through the lens of \"The Beauty Myth,\" we can also understand how beauty has become a product on social media. Influencers and celebrities often take advantage of this myth by promoting beauty products and treatments that promise to help people achieve the \"perfect\" look. This commercialization of beauty creates a culture of consumption that makes money from people's insecurities, further embedding the power of the beauty myth in society.\n      Additionally, the beauty myth perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes that are detrimental to both women and men. For women, it reinforces the idea that their worth is primarily based on their physical appearance, while for men, it promotes toxic masculinity and the notion that they must adhere to specific body types and appearances. The perpetuation of these stereotypes on social media platforms contributes to a culture that values conformity over individuality and exacerbates the harmful impact of the beauty myth.\n      By understanding the role that social media plays in maintaining and promoting the beauty myth, we can raise awareness of the issue and encourage individuals to critically evaluate the images and messages they consume. Creating open conversations about the unrealistic standards perpetuated by the media can help empower individuals to challenge these ideals and promote a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty.\n      Naomi Wolf's idea of \"The Beauty Myth\" offers valuable insights into the puzzle of unattainable beauty standards pushed by social media platforms. By understanding how these standards are oppressive and ever-changing, we can start to see the negative effects they have on people's self-esteem and mental well-being. Furthermore, recognizing the commercialization and consumer culture surrounding beauty on social media allows us to question the systems that profit from our insecurities.\n      The importance of this analysis goes beyond the world of social media, as the beauty myth is deeply rooted in society as a whole. By critically examining and questioning these standards, we can start to break down the oppressive structures that perpetuate them and work towards a more inclusive and empowering definition of beauty. In doing so, we can ultimately create a more just society that celebrates and values diversity in all its forms.\n      One potential way to challenge the beauty myth is through the promotion of body positivity and self-love. Encouraging individuals to embrace their unique appearances and focus on their personal strengths can help counteract the negative effects of unrealistic beauty standards. By sharing diverse images and stories on social media platforms, we can create a more inclusive online environment that reflects the true variety of human beauty.\n      Moreover, educating young people about the harmful effects of the beauty myth and the manipulation of images on social media can help build resilience against the pressure to conform to unrealistic standards. Providing tools for critical thinking and media literacy can empower individuals to navigate the digital landscape with a more discerning eye and a greater understanding of the constructed nature of beauty ideals.\n      Lastly, advocating for greater transparency and responsibility from social media platforms and the advertising industry can help mitigate the harmful impact of the beauty myth. By holding these entities accountable for the content they promote, we can push for a more ethical and inclusive representation of beauty that reflects the diversity of our society.\n      In summary, applying Naomi Wolf's concept of \"The Beauty Myth\" to social media allows us to better understand the pressure of unrealistic beauty standards and their impact on individuals' self-esteem and mental health. By acknowledging the oppressive nature of these standards and the role of social media in perpetuating them, we can work towards dismantling the structures that support the beauty myth and create a more inclusive and diverse understanding of beauty. By doing so, we can foster a more equitable society that values and celebrates the uniqueness of every individual.\n\n\n",

        "text": "\nThe Self Reflection Essay\n\tIs the conception of the self based off the way we perceive ourselves or from the perspective of others; and do the environments we are placed in influence our behaviors? Although, it might seem that we are constantly critiquing ourselves it is seen that the emergence of modernity has shaped the notion of self. One knows who they are, how to act, and when to act in particular ways because of others and their influences. It is a common thought that we are self-aware, but I posit that we are not because within the situation it is difficult to fully grasp this idea. In a report it stated most people believe they are self-aware, yet only 10%-15% of people actually fit the criteria. In western society, it has been noticed that the majority of identities these days come from the perspective of how others perceive us rather than the raw portion of our personalities and what makes us unique for who we are. To understand this concept, one must examine the constituent parts of the self and how they are related to human behavior within different environments. \n\tIn high school I went to a private Christian school where we would wear uniforms and take the most challenging courses in order to be a college preparatory school. While in this setting I was surrounded by everyone who seemed to be there for the same reasons. One, they had money to afford a prestigious school, two, parents wanted their children to be around other Christians so when they left for college they would have a solid foundation, and lastly in order to receive an education that was top tier in the area. As a background as to why I went to this school in the first place is because my family has a legacy there. All of my siblings went to high school at Asheville Christian Academy and my father served on the board. In a sense I did not have the choice whether I wanted to attend. This perspective does not disregard my gratefulness for having the opportunity to attend a college preparatory school though. Yet, from my experiences I have felt that there were moments that did not encompass my true \"self.\" \n\tBecause I was surrounded by the same type of people in high school where we quite literally all looked the same due to the fact, we wore uniforms I think it created a stereotype in which I found myself often times having to pretend to be more Christian than I was in order to please my friend group and teachers who were very religious. For example, each Tuesday the entire high school would have a convocation and chapel. This included a time of worship in which we would all sing. In order to please others, I would sing along even if I didn't feel emotionally connected to the words or meaning of the song. \n\tThis situation at high school to conform to the stereotypes of Christianity and present myself as something that I was not emotionally engaged with is a pure example of Goffman's idea of the presentation of the self. This idea presents that we are always presenting ourselves. He uses a stage as an analogy is where our interactions are produced. The front stage is where we are being presented and must be polished. So, in my situation my idea of the front stage was to act as if I was religious in front of my friends, family, and teachers so that I could appease them. Then, the backstage is where things come together. Before school I would need to prepare myself to act in this way so that everyone would think I was just like them. It was like a coat that you put on and then take off. If I had not bought into feeling the need to act like someone, I was not then I feel like I could've had the opportunity to discover my true self in high school rather than in college.\n\tNow that I am in college here at the University of North Carolina Wilmington as a freshman I have experienced what I would say would be a culture shock. Coming from the background of always being surrounded by the same people in high school I have found that college is much different than that. I have met many people who are from many different backgrounds. I have felt that I have been more able to express who I am and explore who I really want to be. Yet, there are times that I wish I could find a church group because my family always asks me about that when I come home, because I would like to please them and the standards that they have for me. Here at college, I have experienced that one often gets looked down upon for being religious as from experiences with one of my friends who hates on people who are semi-religious. I have a couple of friends who are like me but ultimately it is difficult to find the right people, but this is by choice rather than being forced.\n\tI think the difference between high school and college is that in high school I didn't have as much of a choice as to who I was around, but here at college there is more diversity allowing me to be more open and find myself. Although, I do still struggle sometimes with the presentation of the self and having my identity being influenced by others, I think this in turn plays into James' idea of the self and how we are perceived. \n\tThis has a direct correlation with James' idea of the self. He breaks it down into 3 different parts. The material self which includes clothes, property, friends, and family. I experience this in the way that I am constantly making sure that the clothes I wear fit into what everyone else has. The social self which is my role and reputation is seen through the lens that I want to fit in with my friends here at college and go with the flow. And lastly the pure ego which is the core of my spiritual self and the life force that creates my reactions is what I know is deep down my moral spectrum that won't allow me to do anything bad during my time here at college. Through the different perspectives of the self, I personally agree that I resonate with all of these on a daily basis to appease the people that are around me.\n\tI also resonate with Mead's idea of the I and the Me. He explains how the Self is experienced out of internal dialogue between the \"I\" and the \"Me. Therefore, the \"I\" is the subjective reaction of the mind to the stimuli. So, in my experiences many of the external forces of others and the people I surrounded myself with was the \"I\" in these situation. Yet, the \"Me\" is the objective evaluation of the \"I\" reaction. So, the \"I\" came from my natural reactions, and the \"Me\" would be like an off and on the switch to act accordingly based on my environment. Therefore, the nature of myself can be seen as the nature of the language of society and the particular settings that I have been located in.\n\tThrough the presentation of the self, the idea of the self, and the I and the Me I have been influenced many times to conform to what society has told me to do. Yet, in order for one to combat the issue of conforming to society and finding identity in our true selves we need to believe in ourselves and act accordingly for what we think is right for yourself not what society says. Based on my experiences, I am still learning how to do this and how to surround myself with people that I feel like I can be myself in. \nWorks Cited\nGoffman, Erving. The Presentation of the Self.

        "text": "6957\nWorking the System\n\n      Did you actually earn your job? Throughout our lives, we always wonder who we lost out on when we did not get the job we applied for. Oftentimes this is due to factors entirely out of our control. Many of the jobs we apply to are given to individuals who already have their foot in the door through connections with people already working within the company. This experience is seen with most jobs you will ever apply to limiting but not excluding minimum wage jobs.\nOftentimes many job openings don't even become publicly posted, instead, they are filled by personal or professional connections. In today's society getting a job is not about being the most certified of the applicants, rather it is a competition between who has the most links within the company.\n      Back home I work at a pharmacy in Concord with my sister, Abigail, and I can without a doubt say it is because of her that I got the job. Before I worked there it was well known that family was not allowed to be hired, but because of my sister's good relationship with our boss, he allowed me to apply. Granted this application came with the guarantee that I would get the job, and when I went in for my \"interview\" I was simply told what I needed to bring for them to get me into the system and on the payroll. Not only was I essentially handed the job, but I also started out making more than some of my coworkers. I have experienced this with nearly every job I have ever applied for. My first job working at American Eagle was a job I attained through a referral from a friend who worked there. His influence within the company allowed me to get an interview quicker and gave me an edge compared to other applicants. Furthermore, my second job, at a restaurant near my house, was not hiring at the time, but my friend talked to the manager\n\nto get me an interview. This interview lasted around five minutes and upon sitting down he told me I got the job.\n      I did not necessarily earn any of these jobs, instead, I was able to use the connections I have with my siblings and friends to work my way into the company and this is seen time and time again with nearly any job you apply to. I have not only experienced this but I have witnessed it. For example, my mother has an associate's degree in nursing, which typically a bachelor's degree or higher is preferred when applying to jobs within this field, but because of the networking she has done throughout her career she has easily gotten any job she has applied for. She has also been selected for a promotion before coworkers who have been with the company longer. This reveals that it is not the qualifications or the interview that get you the job, instead, it is the connections you have that give you a front running.\n      Gregory Mantsios explains that America is not a classless society and that individuals are not impoverished because of their lack of effort, but because people are confined by the opportunities afforded by their social and economic system. This social and economic system is controlled through institutions that reproduce this hierarchical class structure making it extremely hard for people to outgrow the class they are born into because they are given the same limitations as their parents. The first connection that allows us to gain experience with networking that will allow us to get high-paying jobs within society is our parents. The schools we are able to go to and the education we are able to receive are all confined to the class we are born into. Higher-class families can afford tutors and private institutions that allow their kids a front running at getting into low-accepting colleges. Lower-class families do not have these same advantages. Some other factors that contribute to explaining why some have more than others include generational wealth, community, and discrimination. The community consists of who\n\nyou grow up being surrounded by if you grow up in a nicer area you will have more opportunities to get jobs through high-class individuals living around you.\n      Even at a young age, we are being subjected to a system that allows for little growth. The rich will continue getting richer, not because they are more qualified, but because of the connections to leaders of these institutions that give them the ability to get higher-paying jobs with little work. Class plays a major part in the jobs individuals will be able to attain.\nHigher-class individuals have more relationships with people controlling these institutions or with people who have influence within these corporations, in turn, making getting a job much easier.\n      The power elite as discussed by Domhoff puts into perspective why this class system will continue to be perpetuated. The power elite are the leaders of the institutions that hold a massive amount of influence in the way society is run. Members within the power elite thrive off neoliberalism which gives them the environment needed to keep getting richer while keeping the poor impoverished. Many levels are also seen between poor and rich such as the middle class and these people are also subjected to the power elite. The power elite plays into the class system seen within the U.S. as it explains why the working class has such little power to change this unequal distribution of opportunity.\n      This hierarchical class system is seen throughout my experiences along with in my observations as I and my mother both have gotten jobs as a result of our class within society. I would consider my family middle class and because of this, we are granted more opportunities than lower-class individuals but less than upper-class individuals. These opportunities have allowed us the environment we need to network and create connections that have permitted us to achieve higher positions without better qualifications. My family, however, is still limited to\n\ntypically only being able to achieve middle-class positions easily as it allows for the reproduction of this class system that is perpetuated by the power elite.\n      Class does exist within America and it contributes heavily to what individuals will be able to achieve in their lifetime. People are not rich and people are not poor because of putting in more or less work. People are held down by the policies within America that grant these institutions the privileges they need to keep extending their wealth. People are also limited through their connections that either help or lessen their chances of getting jobs depending on their status within the hierarchy. It is nearly impossible to grow outside of the barriers you are born into as a result of the class your family is placed into and this is seen throughout my experiences in the workplace. There are many explanations people can give to explain their wealth such as \"I earned it\" but these all are meant to hide the material consequences of wealth that result from inequality within the market. Overall, we cannot deny that there is an unequal distribution of wealth within America as a result of policies that favor the rich.\n\n\n",

        "text": "1246\nPretty Privilege\n\n      Is so-called pretty privilege a legitimate concept? Although people may not realize or do not do it on purpose, it is believed that people who fit the more conventional beauty standards of society are generally treated better, get more attention, and even get special treatment sometimes. Despite how good or smart a person is on the inside, they are primarily judged based on how they look on the outside. In many settings in America, from coffee shops to places of work, women are judged first on their beauty. Despite women having little to no control over how they look naturally, it is still most people's first line of judgment. It encourages competition between women, which hinders their ability to gain power in a society which favors men. The basis of this lies in the fact that women are expected to be beautiful and fit into cookie cutter standards, and the fact they are judged mostly on their appearance.\n       Subtle examples of women receiving special treatment because they are traditionally considered beautiful in American society can be seen everywhere. I personally have seen women with blonde hair and a happy expression on their face get free discounts at stores or help carrying something from a stranger, for no apparent reason other than they are beautiful. Even though somebody who might have darker hair or look less put together, but was just as kind to the person at the counter would not get the same treatment. I also can say I have experienced this firsthand. I can notice that people will treat me just slightly differently when I am wearing makeup and dressed nicely compared to when I am not and am wearing more relaxed clothing. A specific incident I can recall of my experience happened at a coffee shop in my hometown. One day when I went in wearing a put together outfit and wearing makeup, the man behind the counter told me I was too beautiful to pay. The next day I went in wearing no makeup and just a\n\nt-shirt. All of a sudden, I was no longer too beautiful to pay. However, when I was viewed as fitting society's beauty standards, the rules no longer applied to me because of that. Nothing about the interaction had been different, other than the fact I no longer fit whatever he viewed as the perfect beauty standard.\n      Throughout American culture, the women who often play the protagonists in movies or shows are almost always a perfect image of what society deems as attractive. Even in movies, the exact example of being exempt from paying for something small, such as a coffee is seen on numerous occasions. Generally in Hollywood, you don't even see actresses who do not fit the beauty myth because they never make it into the public eye. Just by being perceived in the casting room as beautiful, they are automatically given a leg up. In video games, music videos, television, and essentially all public forums that are specifically designed for some purpose, the women are always perceived to be beautiful. Even though this may be achieved through editing real women, or just creating an ideal version through animations, women and even young girls are told that they have to look like this ideal, unrealistic, version of women. No matter where it can be seen, it is always projected to look like the same traditional vision of beauty.\n      Naomi Wolf's concept of the beauty myth states that women should be beautiful, and men should have access to beautiful women. It is the backlash of second wave feminism to prevent women from gaining power through groups, and instead keep them pitted against each other. The beauty myth keeps society so that it is still favored against women, who are now in constant competition with each other. This ideal image of a woman is created of women, but not for them as a result of the power structure. Ultimately, men created the idea of the beauty myth to cause women to focus more on being in competition than gaining power back from men.\n\n      The beauty myth and pretty privilege go hand in hand with each other. The beauty myth maintains the idea that women need to be beautiful, which in turn creates the culture that beautiful women are rewarded. People are given a leg up in society if they spend time trying to fit these specific standards. Since they are then viewed as beautiful and have spent time being in competition with other women, they are rewarded by society. In the example pertaining to the coffee shop, everybody involved, including the men, have been conditioned to think women have to be beautiful. In my personal experience, by not receiving a free coffee when I was not done up, it spread the idea that I always need to be perceived as beautiful. The reward of being pretty, in this instance free coffee, keeps women striving to continue to be better and viewed as the most beautiful.\n      Throughout media and public displays, women are not even allowed to be seen as anything but beautiful. This very public image continues to spread and cause women to want to be as beautiful as the edited women on their screen, who have a hair stylist, makeup artist, dietician, and plastic surgeon to make them look a certain way. The reason women are only shown in the public eye this way is to perpetuate the beauty myth, and make sure women are not gaining power. The only way the beauty myth would be able to cease to exist is if all women recognized the issues that stem from it, and refused to continue to fall victim to it. By embracing the fact that all women look different, and there is no right or wrong way, it would stop the constant competition between women. However, American society continues to make women victim to the beauty myth through many different ways, and pretty privilege is only one of the few that can be seen all throughout our culture.\n      Even if women were to recognize this and make an effort to combat the beauty myth. It is so embedded in society that it would be nearly impossible to completely erase. Between women\n\nwho can not seem to let the competition go, or being encouraged to keep it in place by men, the beauty myth is here to stay. Even though it is widely known that a person's worth is not placed on how attractive they are perceived, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the beauty myth has been a persistent part of society since the beginning of second wave feminism. Subtle pretty privilege is a clear sign of the fact that the beauty myth is an extremely present part of our western world. Because of the huge role the beauty myth plays in our society, people's first line of judgment is frequently how well somebody fits into these beauty standards. Conventional beauty can play a huge role in how somebody's life is famed. Whether they get a certain job or opportunity based on their ability to fit beauty standards can essentially change somebody's life. The most effective way to combat the beauty myth is to stop judging somebody because of how they look, but rather who they are as a person. By doing this, society can put a stop to pretty privilege, and slowly try to reverse the effects the beauty myth has had.\n\n\n",

        "text": "\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThrough the Looking Glass\n\tIs how someone else interprets your value in life more important than the value you uphold yourself to? In our society today, the importance of things such as how much money you make, what kind of brands of clothing you wear, and the grade on top of your paper has begun formulating itself into how you may believe others perceive you. Many people may interpret what those around them say concerning their overall well-being as the value they deserve to hold themselves to. One may begin to believe they have to hear certain things to recognize a person they like in the mirror. Constant thinking of what others think of you can cause a serious detrimental downfall in your overall self-esteem. \n      Growing up, I was always on top of my grades. I would never want to miss a day of school, and would always feel immense guilt if I had to stay home for any reason at all. I never felt forced by my parents or anyone around me in my early years to get good grades, as it always came easy to me. I never needed to sit for long periods studying for exams or had to spend hours on homework. I received multiple academic awards throughout my time in middle school and high school and I never imagined it could get harder than what I've seen from the beginning. I realized the true standards my parents held me to once I hit my senior year. I quickly had a sudden awakening that things would not remain as easy as I believed they had been for so long in my academic life. \n      Walking into my freshman year of college as a nursing major, I realized how important my grades were and that I would not get by without studying. These topics did not come as easily to me as they did throughout my earlier years of school. My grades had begun to slightly slip, but the only thing on my mind was what my parents were going to think of me. I would avoid phone calls from my parents whom I knew were going to question my grade in my biology class- my most important class of the semester. I began to become harder on myself each day, feeling like I was not smart enough to take these courses, as I thought that's what my parents would believe of me. I would spend relentless hours trying to cram all the material I could into my head days before my exam, but my grade would only crawl up small percentages. I felt lost, thinking I couldn't confide in my parents because they would be disappointed in me, and I soon became disappointed in myself. I thought if I changed my major I was so proud to uphold, what would people think of me? My mind was constantly brewing the idea of people assuming I was not smart enough to pursue a career in nursing, and I began to begin to believe it. I worked as hard as I could but did not receive the A in the class I needed to continue my route in applying to the nursing program. I met with my advisor and she recommended me to retake the class to receive an A because a B was not sufficient. I was immediately embarrassed, thinking she was the first person to potentially think low of me, and I could only imagine what my parents would think of me after hearing this. \n      After telling my parents what had happened in the following weeks, I recognized they weren't there to judge me based on my academics, but there to support me regardless of the situation. Hearing how much they were there to be a support system to me, I stopped being so hard on myself and have found myself in a comfortable studying habit; with my grades back to where they should be. I needed to stop overthinking how I assumed people would perceive me and begin to do the work for myself and my hopeful future. No one around me would have thought any less of me, but when I looked back at myself that was all I thought of my person, the grade was on top of a paper.   \n          According to Charles Horton Cooley, \"The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind.\" (Cooley 142) Throughout his article, he emphasizes the point that the way you feel about yourself comes directly from how you believe others perceive you. We look at ourselves in the mirror and see how other people see us rather than our actual selves. Just as in an example of society, we may change the way we dress or act, based on what we believe those that surround us will be most satisfied with. If you surround yourself with a group of people who act a certain way, you may change your being to avoid any judgment from them. Cooley highlights the idea that we bring the \"I\" of ourselves into social settings, forcing us also to bring the idea of self-esteem into it. We feel validated when someone says something positive about us since we will immediately believe how the rest of the public eye will view us, increasing our self-esteem. He created this theory, and referred to it as the \"looking-glass self.\"  \n      Connecting back to my personal experience, instead of looking at the bigger picture of my grades, I was worried about what the people closest to me would think of me. I convinced myself in my head I was not smart enough for the courses I was taking, and that's what everyone else would think, but no one ever did. I changed the way that I thought about my own well-being within my academic standing because that's what I imagined my parents would think. What I saw in my mirror was someone who wasn't committed to their work, and was not able to strive in a college environment. Through my looking glass, I saw someone unable to succeed, but I was able to change my perspective once I recognized no one but myself believed this about me. \n      We often change the way that we do things in our lives to satisfy those around us. The idea of what one may want us to be like can truly degrade our self-image. Through Cooley's idea of the \"looking-glass self\", one can understand the theory of people changing the way they perceive themselves due to what they imagine what others think of them. Many people may interpret what those around them say concerning their overall well-being as how much value they should hold themselves to. I used my own experience to help me understand that not many people care as much as you think, and your own thoughts should be how you interpret yourself without the input of other people's possible opinions. We mainly are the reflection of other's minds, but you have the ability to take charge and eliminate those ideas from overpowering your own self-esteem.

        "text": "      'Country Club Classism'\n      Class is everywhere in the world. It is in your family, in your workplace, and even in your favorite restaurant.Class is where you work, where you live, what type of food you eat, and even what time of family you have.  Class is especially perpetuated by Country Clubs by supporting classism.  Everyone in our society is grouped into four different classes; Lower class, Middle class, Working class, and Upper class (Although the working class is usually included in the middle class section). Class is divided into four groups based on wealth and or income. \n\n      The first time I had fully experienced class and saw the different levels in society was when I first began my job at Landfall's Country Club. I have worked in Landfall for almost a year now and I have learned a lot about the upper middle and upper class. Landfall is primarily occupied by the upper class as most homes cost an average of 1.5 million dollars. These individuals have the opportunity for many things in their own neighborhood as it includes a clubhouse with two restaurants on top of ballrooms, another clubhouse that has an array of bars and luxury rooms for big events such as weddings, and a sports center that sports an Olympic size pool as well as many pickleball and tennis courts. \n\n      The difference in our society is further supported through country clubs with their big white gates separating the richer individuals from the rest of society. This large gated community has made it possible for the Upper classes to limit their exposure to society and interact with only those who have a similar socioeconomic status. This limited exposure has caused a greater rift in our society and made the difference in class much more prevalent. Within my time at the country club I have seen how outsiders are treated and overheard many conversations from individuals thinking they are above others purely due to the neighborhood in which they live. These individuals talk about how they have more money and expensive cars so that automatically makes them better than the people who do not live in landfall. They also treat outsiders poorly, as I clean the building there I am usually looked down upon because I clean and don't live off of my parents like most of their kids do. Most individuals there are very ungrateful for the workers and take advantage of their status to put other individuals down so that they feel better about themselves.\n\n      The Upper Class refers to individuals who are at the top of society's hierarchy. They have the most wealth and have the lowest population in society. The Upper class individuals tend to have the highest positions in our society and make the most decisions about what happens within the other classes. Overall, they tend to carry the most power with finances, politics, as well as economics. The Middle Class also referred to an included with the working class is located between the upper and lower classes in society. y. The middle class usually consists of professional people, farmers, skilled workers, and even government officials. The middle class has some say so within the society and work hard to keep most things afloat. Most middle class individuals are who keep the businesses in our town going, as well as, allow you to go to school, get groceries, and even go to the library. The Lower Class are the individuals who are at the bottom of society. They are usually service workers, manual laborers, and or unemployed. The Lower class in our society are usually if not always confined to the class due to the struggle in our society when it comes to saving enough money to get yourself out of the lower class. Poverty affects the majority of the Lower and Middle class in our society. With these individuals struggling to take care of themselves and or their family it can be very hard to move up. \n\n      Class is viewed as something important to most in our society. It can influence what type of family you have, if you have children, and even what job you will have in the future. Being placed in a specific social class can further influence what type of school you attend which can affect your level of education. There are many ways other individuals in our society view and experience class. The lower classes view class as something that holds them back in society and prevents them from getting to their full potential. They view the Upper classes as privileged or spoiled.  While, the Upper classes view class as some sort of trophy to show off and set them above others due to their class advantage. They believe that the lower classes are inferior and less educated.  Lastly the Middle class, the Middle class tends to join the Upper class on looking down on the Lower class, however they join in with the Lower class when it comes to speaking out on classism.\n\n      Individuals in our society can affect how class is viewed by spreading information on what class actually is and how they should be viewing it. Class is something that is important to our society, however, it is not something that should be used to group individuals together to influence their entire future. Individuals should have the opportunity to be able to get a good education and get a well paying job no matter their class. To be able to spread this ideal, we first need to share the knowledge of what class actually is and what it is used for. Individuals would need to learn that class is not a trophy and or something that is here to hold them back in life but is purely here to group together individuals to see how well they are doing in society. However, we also need to change how class is used currently in our society. The ideals that the Upper class is better and will always be in the Upper class need to be let go and the individuals need to be reminded that one class is not better than the other and it should not be used to put and or hold others down. Everyone in our society should have the same opportunities in life, they deserve to get similar educations, be able to support their families, and in the end just live a happy life. \n\n      Class status influences a lot of things in our society, from where you work, where you go to school, to even what type of food you eat. Class has a lot of influence over your future and tends to keep you confined to whatever class your family is a part of. Class is not so evenly split between the Upper, Middle, and Lower class, and whatever class you are a part of can influence your entire future. The height of classism can be seen in many things in society such as the existence of country clubs. Country Clubs can be seen supporting classism through cutting off individuals who are deemed 'too poor' to be a part of their club, and cutting the richer people off from the rest of society. Overall, Country Clubs support classism and aid in further separating the Upper class from the Middle and Lower classes in our society.",
